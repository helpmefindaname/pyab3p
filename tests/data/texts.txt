"Real-world" data on the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who were treated according to the standard clinical practice: a study of the Greek Myeloma Study Group.
(Over)correction of FMR1 deficiency with YAC transgenics: behavioral and physical features.
-Tacrolimus (FK 506) is a powerful, widely used immunosuppressant. The clinical utility of FK 506 is complicated by substantial hypertension and nephrotoxicity. To clarify the mechanisms of FK 506-induced hypertension, we studied the chronic effects of FK 506 on the synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the expression of mRNA of ET-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in rat blood vessels. In addition, the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist FR 139317 on FK 506-induced hypertension in rats was studied. FK 506, 5 mg. kg-1. d-1 given for 4 weeks, elevated blood pressure from 102+/-13 to 152+/-15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET-1 and the levels of ET-1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery (240% and 230%, respectively). Little change was observed in the expression of ECE-1 mRNA and CNP mRNA. FK 506 decreased eNOS activity and the levels of eNOS mRNA in the aorta (48% and 55%, respectively). The administration of FR 139317 (10 mg. kg-1. d-1) prevented FK 506-induced hypertension in rats. These results indicate that FK 506 may increase blood pressure not only by increasing ET-1 production but also by decreasing NO synthesis in the vasculature.
1 The small protein Bv8, isolated from amphibian skin, belongs to a novel family of secretory proteins (Bv8-Prokineticin family, SWISS-PROT: Q9PW66) whose orthologues have been conserved throughout evolution, from invertebrates to humans. 2 When injected intravenously or subcutaneously (from 0.06 to 500 pmol kg(-1)) or intrathecally (from 6 fmol to 250 pmol) in rats, Bv8 produced an intense systemic nociceptive sensitization to mechanical and thermal stimuli applied to the tail and paws. 3 Topically delivered into one rat paw, 50 fmol of Bv8 decreased by 50% the nociceptive threshold to pressure in the injected paw without affecting the threshold in the contralateral paw. 4 The two G-protein coupled prokineticin receptors, PK-R1 and PK-R2, were expressed in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and in dorsal quadrants of spinal cord (DSC) and bound Bv8 and the mammalian orthologue, EG-VEGF, with high affinity. In DSC, PK-R1 was more abundant than PK-R2, whereas both receptors were equally expressed in DRG. IC(50) of Bv8 and EG-VEGF to inhibit -Bv8 binding to rat DRG and DSC were 4.1+/-0.4 nM Bv8 and 76.4+/-7.6 nM EG-VEGF, in DRG; 7.3+/-0.9 nM Bv8 and 330+/-41 nM EG-VEGF, in DSC. 5 In the small diameter neurons (<30 microm) of rat DRG cultures, Bv8 concentrations, ranging from 0.2 to 10 nM, raised (i) in a dose-dependent manner. 6 These data suggest that Bv8, through binding to PK receptors of DSC and primary sensitive neurons, results in intense sensitization of peripheral nociceptors to thermal and mechanical stimuli.
1,3-Butadiene, CML and the t(9:22) translocation: A reality check.
1. Dexamethasone (Dex)-induced hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with nitric oxide (NO) deficiency and increased superoxide (O2-) production. Atorvastatin (Ato) possesses pleiotropic properties that have been reported to improve endothelial function through increased availability of NO and reduced O2- production in various forms of hypertension. In the present study, we investigated whether 50 mg/kg per day, p.o., Ato could prevent endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) downregulation and the increase in O2- in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, thereby reducing blood pressure. 2. Male SD rats (n = 30) were treated with Ato (50 mg/kg per day in drinking water) or tap water for 15 days. Dexamethasone (10 microg/kg per day, s.c.) or saline was started after 4 days in Ato-treated and non-treated rats and continued for 11-13 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured on alternate days using the tail-cuff method. Endothelial function was assessed by acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation and phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction in aortic segments. Vascular eNOS mRNA was assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 3. In rats treated with Dex alone, SBP was increased from 109 +/- 2 to 133 +/- 2 mmHg on Days 4 and Day 14, respectively (P < 0.001). In the Ato + Dex group, SBP was increased from 113 +/- 2 to 119 +/- 2 mmHg on Days 4 to 14, respectively (P < 0.001), but was significantly lower than SBP in the group treated with Dex alone (P < 0.05). Endothelial-dependent relaxation and eNOS mRNA expression were greater in the Dex + Ato group than in the Dex only group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Aortic superoxide production was lower in the Dex + Ato group compared with the group treated with Dex alone (P < 0.0001). 4. Treatment with Ato improved endothelial function, reduced superoxide production and reduced SBP in Dex-treated SD rats.
1. Glucocorticoid-induced hypertension (GC-HT) in the rat is associated with nitric oxide-redox imbalance. 2. We studied the role of xanthine oxidase (XO), which is implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species, in dexamethasone-induced hypertension (dex-HT). 3. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into four treatment groups: saline, dexamethasone (dex), allopurinol plus saline, and allopurinol plus dex. 4. Systolic blood pressures (SBP) and bodyweights were recorded each alternate day. Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity, and serum urate to assess XO inhibition. 5. Dex increased SBP (110 +/- 2-126 +/- 3 mmHg; P < 0.001) and decreased thymus (P < 0.001) and bodyweights (P" < 0.01). Allopurinol decreased serum urate from 76 +/- 5 to 30 +/- 3 micromol/L (P < 0.001) in saline and from 84 +/- 13 to 28 +/- 2 micromol/L in dex-treated (P < 0.01) groups. 6. Allopurinol did not prevent dex-HT. This, together with our previous findings that allopurinol failed to prevent adrenocorticotrophic hormone induced hypertension, suggests that XO activity is not a major determinant of GC-HT in the rat.
1. Nociceptin, also known as orphanin FQ, is an endogenous ligand for the orphan opioid receptor-like receptor 1 (ORL1) and involves in various functions in the central nervous system (CNS). On the other hand, nocistatin is recently isolated from the same precursor as nociceptin and blocks nociceptin-induced allodynia and hyperalgesia. 2. Although ORL1 receptors which display a high degree of sequence homology with classical opioid receptors are abundant in the hippocampus, little is known regarding their role in learning and memory. 3. The present study was designed to investigate whether nociceptin/orphanin FQ and nocistatin could modulate impairment of learning and memory induced by scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, using spontaneous alternation of Y-maze and step-down type passive avoidance tasks in mice. 4. While nocistatin (0.5-5.0 nmol mouse-1, i.c.v.) administered 30 min before spontaneous alternation performance or the training session of the passive avoidance task, had no effect on spontaneous alternation or passive avoidance behaviours, a lower per cent alternation and shorter median step-down latency in the retention test were obtained in nociceptin (1.5 and/or 5.0 nmol mouse-1, i.c.v.)-treated normal mice. 5. Administration of nocistatin (1.5 and/or 5.0 nmol mouse-1, i.c.v.) 30 min before spontaneous alternation performance or the training session of the passive avoidance task, attenuated the scopolamine-induced impairment of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance behaviours. 6. These results indicated that nocistatin, a new biologically active peptide, ameliorates impairments of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance induced by scopolamine, and suggested that these peptides play opposite roles in learning and memory.
1. Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic prazosin treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Conscious SHR (male 300-350 g) were subjected to 90 degrees head-up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.) or rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.). Orthostatic hypotension was determined by the average decrease (%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP femoral) over the 60-s tilt period. The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by prazosin (-23%(-)-26% MAP) and rauwolscine (-16%(-)-33% MAP). However, the head-up tilt induced orthostatic hypotension in the SHR treated with prazosin (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with rauwolscine (less than +2% MAP, n = 6). 3. Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with prazosin at 2 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p. for chronic alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. MAP in conscious SHR after chronic prazosin treatment was 14% lower than in the untreated SHR (n = 8). Head-up tilts in these rats did not produce orthostatic hypotension when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.). Conversely, administration of rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) in chronic prazosin treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12-31% (n = 4), and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19-23% in these rats. 4. The pressor responses and bradycardia to the alpha 1-agonist cirazoline (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist Abbott-53693 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and noradrenaline (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic prazosin pretreatment. Both the pressor and bradycardia effects of cirazoline were abolished in chronic prazosin treated SHR (n = 4) as compared to the untreated SHR (n = 4). On the other hand, the pressor effects of Abbott-53693 were similar in both groups of SHR, but the accompanying bradycardia was greater in SHR with chronic prazosin treatment than without such treatment. Furthermore, the bradycardia that accompanied the noradrenaline-induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic prazosin treatment despite a 47-71% reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1-receptor blocked SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1. The authors examined the anticonvulsant effects of MK-801 on the pilocarpine-induced seizure model. Intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine (400 mg/kg) induced tonic and clonic seizure. Scopolamine (10 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (5 mg/kg) prevented development of pilocarpine-induced behavioral seizure but MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg) did not. 2. An electrical seizure measured with hippocampal EEG appeared in the pilocarpine-treated group. Scopolamine and pentobarbital blocked the pilocarpine-induced electrographic seizure, MK-801 treatment augmented the electrographic seizure induced by pilocarpine. 3. Brain damage was assessed by examining the hippocampus microscopically. Pilocarpine produced neuronal death in the hippocampus, which showed pyknotic changes. Pentobarbital, scopolamine and MK-801 protected the brain damage by pilocarpine, though in the MK-801-treated group, the pyramidal cells of hippocampus appeared darker than normal. In all treatments, granule cells of the dentate gyrus were not affected. 4. These results indicate that status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine is initiated by cholinergic overstimulation and propagated by glutamatergic transmission, the elevation of which may cause brain damage through an excitatory NMDA receptor-mediated mechanism.
1. The catalepsy induced by dopamine antagonists has been tested and the possible dopamine subtypes involved in catalepsy was determined. 2. Dopamine antagonist fluphenazine, D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 or D-2 antagonist sulpiride induced catalepsy. The effect of fluphenazine and sulpiride was dose-dependent. Combination of SCH 23390 with sulpiride did not induce catalepsy potentiation. 3. D-1 agonist SKF 38393 or D-2 agonist quinpirole decreased the catalepsy induced by fluphenazine, SCH 23390 or sulpiride. 4. Combination of SKF 38393 with quinpirole did not cause potentiated inhibitory effect on catalepsy induced by dopamine antagonists. 5. The data may indicate that although D-2 receptor blockade is involved in catalepsy, the D-1 receptor may plan a role.
1. The effects of insulin treatment on in vivo and in vitro urinary bladder function in streptozotocin-diabetic rats were investigated. 2. Diabetes of 2 months duration resulted in decreases in body weight and increases in fluid consumption, urine volume, frequency of micturition, and average volume per micturition; effects which were prevented by insulin treatment. 3. Insulin treatment also prevented the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from diabetic rats to nerve stimulation, ATP, and bethanechol. 4. Diabetes of 4 months duration also resulted in decreases in body weight, and increases in fluid consumption, urine volume, frequency of micturition, and average volume per micturition, effects which were reversed by insulin treatment for the final 2 months of the study. 5. Insulin treatment reversed the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from diabetic rats to nerve stimulation, ATP, and bethanechol. 6. The data indicate that the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on urinary bladder function are both prevented and reversed by insulin treatment.
1. The effects of two unselective potassium (K(+)-) channel blockers, quinine (12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg) and 4-aminopyridine (1 and 2 mg/kg), on conditioned place preference and biphasic changes in motor activity induced by morphine (10 mg/kg) were tested in Wistar rats. Quinine is known to block voltage-, calcium- and ATP-sensitive K(+)-channels while 4-aminopyridine is known to block voltage-sensitive K(+)-channels. 2. In the counterbalanced method, quinine attenuated morphine-induced place preference, whereas 4-aminopyridine was ineffective. In the motor activity test measured with an Animex-activity meter neither of the K(+)-channel blockers affected morphine-induced hypoactivity, but both K(+)-channel blockers prevented morphine-induced secondary hyperactivity. 3. These results suggest the involvement of quinine-sensitive but not 4-aminopyridine-sensitive K(+)-channels in morphine reward. It is also suggested that the blockade of K(+)-channels sensitive to these blockers is not sufficient to prevent morphine-induced hypoactivity whereas morphine-induced hyperactivity seems to be connected to both quinine- and 4-aminopyridine-sensitive K(+)-channels.
1. The optical isomers of propranolol have been compared for their beta-blocking and antiarrhythmic activities.2. In blocking the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoprenaline, (+)-propranolol had less than one hundredth the potency of (-)-propranolol. At dose levels of (+)-propranolol which attenuated the responses to isoprenaline, there was a significant prolongation of the PR interval of the electrocardiogram.3. The metabolic responses to isoprenaline in dogs (an increase in circulating glucose, lactate and free fatty acids) were all blocked by (-)-propranolol. (+)-Propranolol had no effect on fatty acid mobilization but significantly reduced the increments in both lactate and glucose.4. Both isomers of propranolol possessed similar depressant potency on isolated atrial muscle taken from guinea-pigs.5. The isomers of propranolol exhibited similar local anaesthetic potencies on an isolated frog nerve preparation at a level approximately three times that of procaine. The racemic compound was significantly less potent than either isomer.6. Both isomers of propranolol were capable of preventing adrenaline-induced cardiac arrhythmias in cats anaesthetized with halothane, but the mean dose of (-)-propranolol was 0.09+/-0.02 mg/kg whereas that of (+)-propranolol was 4.2+/-1.2 mg/kg. At the effective dose level of (+)-propranolol there was a significant prolongation of the PR interval of the electrocardiogram. Blockade of arrhythmias with both isomers was surmountable by increasing the dose of adrenaline.7. Both isomers of propranolol were also capable of reversing ventricular tachycardia caused by ouabain in anaesthetized cats and dogs. The dose of (-)-propranolol was significantly smaller than that of (+)-propranolol in both species but much higher than that required to produce evidence of beta-blockade.8. The implications of these results are discussed.
1. Torsades de pointes (TDP) is a potentially fatal ventricular tachycardia associated with increases in QT interval and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD). TDP is a side-effect that has led to withdrawal of several drugs from the market (e.g. terfenadine and terodiline). 2. The potential of compounds to cause TDP was evaluated by monitoring their effects on MAPD in dog. Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause TDP were investigated: terfenadine, terodiline, cisapride and E4031. On the basis that only free drug in the systemic circulation will elicit a pharmacological response target, free concentrations in plasma were selected to mimic the free drug exposures in man. Infusion regimens were designed that rapidly achieved and maintained target-free concentrations of these drugs in plasma and data on the relationship between free concentration and changes in MAPD were obtained for these compounds. 3. These data indicate that the free ED50 in plasma for terfenadine (1.9 nM), terodiline (76 nM), cisapride (11 nM) and E4031 (1.9 nM) closely correlate with the free concentration in man causing QT effects. For compounds that have shown TDP in the clinic (terfenadine, terodiline, cisapride) there is little differentiation between the dog ED50 and the efficacious free plasma concentrations in man (< 10-fold) reflecting their limited safety margins. These data underline the need to maximize the therapeutic ratio with respect to TDP in potential development candidates and the importance of using free drug concentrations in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies.
10 monkeys (macaques) received adriamycin by monthly intravenous injections at 12 mg/m2 (1 mg/kg). 8 of the 10 monkeys developed congestive heart failure at an average cumulative adriamycin dose (310 mg/m2) well below that considered the safe upper limit (550 mg/m2) in man. Histologically, the myocardial lesions resembled those found in human anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. 1 of the 10 monkeys developed acute myeloblastic leukemia after receiving 324 mg/m2 of adriamycin; the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug. Our results suggest that adriamycin is a more potent cardiotoxin in monkeys than in man, and that leukemia may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug.
15 cases of cimetidine-associated mental confusion have been reported. In order that this syndrome might be investigated changes in mental status (M.S.) were correlated with serum concentrations and renal and hepatic function in 36 patients, 30 patients had no M.S. change on cimetidine and 6 had moderate to severe changes. These 6 patients had both renal and liver dysfunction (P less than 0.05), as well as cimetidine trough-concentrations of more than 1.25 microgram/ml (P less than 0.05). The severity of M.S. changes increased as trough-concentrations rose, 5 patients had lumbar puncture. The cerebrospinal fluid: serum ratio of cimetidine concentrations was 0.24:1 and indicates that cimetidine passes the blood-brain barrier; it also raises the possibility that M.S. changes are due to blockade of histamine H2-receptors in the central nervous system. Patients likely to have both raised trough-concentrations and mental confusion are those with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction. They should be closely observed and should be given reduced doses of cimetidine.
22-oxacalcitriol suppresses secondary hyperparathyroidism without inducing low bone turnover in dogs with renal failure.
3-Methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (MPG protein) interacts with human RAD23 proteins.
3p deletion syndrome is a rare contiguous-gene disorder involving the loss of the telomeric portion of the short arm of chromosome 3 and characterized by developmental delay, growth retardation, and dysmorphic features. All reported cases have involved, at a minimum, the deletion of chromosome 3 telomeric to the band 3p25.3. Despite the presence of several genes in this region that are involved in neural development, a causative relationship between a particular transcript and the observed clinical manifestations has remained elusive. We have identified a child with characteristic physical features of 3p deletion syndrome and both verbal and nonverbal developmental delay who carries a de novo balanced translocation involving chromosomes 3 and 10. Fine mapping of this rearrangement demonstrates that the translocation breakpoint on chromosome 3 falls within the recently identified minimal candidate region for 3p deletion syndrome and disrupts the Contactin 4 (CNTN4) mRNA transcript at 3p26.2-3p26.3. This transcript (also known as BIG-2) is a member of the immunoglobulin super family of neuronal cell adhesion molecules involved in axon growth, guidance, and fasciculation in the central nervous system (CNS). Our results demonstrate the association of CNTN4 disruption with the 3p deletion syndrome phenotype and strongly suggest a causal relationship. These findings point to an important role for CNTN4 in normal and abnormal CNS development.
5 flourouracil-induced apical ballooning syndrome: a case report.
5 patients with acute renal failure (3 with thrombopenia and hemolysis) induced by the reintroduction of rifampicin are described. No correlation was found between the severity of clinical manifestations and the total dose taken by the patients. In all but 1 patient, antirifampicin antibodies were detected. Antibodies suggested to be of the IgM class were detected in all 3 patients with hematological disorders. The pattern of non-specific acute tubular necrosis found in the 2 biopsied patients, indistinguishable from that of ischemic origin, raised the possibility of a vascular-mediated damage. In 3 patients, the possibility of a triggering immunoallergic mechanism is discussed.
5-Fluorouracil cardiotoxicity induced by alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine.
5-Fluorouracil plus folinic acid and paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) are effective salvage therapies for metastatic breast cancer patients. Paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil have additive cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cell lines. We performed a phase II trial of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours on day I followed by folinic acid 300 mg over 1 hour before 5-fluorouracil 350 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 every 28 days (TFL) in women with metastatic breast cancer. Analysis is reported on 37 patients with a minimum of 6 months follow-up who received a total of 192 cycles of TFL: nine cycles (5%) were associated with grade 3/4 neutropenia requiring hospitalization; seven (4%) cycles in two patients required granulocyte colony-stimulating factor due to neutropenia; no patient required platelet transfusions. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities were uncommon. Among the 34 patients evaluable for response, there were three complete responses (9%) and 18 partial responses (53%) for an overall response rate of 62%. Of the 19 evaluable patients with prior doxorubicin exposure, 11 (58%) responded compared with nine of 15 (60%) without prior doxorubicin. Plasma paclitaxel concentrations were measured at the completion of paclitaxel infusion and at 24 hours in 19 patients. TFL is an active, well-tolerated regimen in metastatic breast cancer.
5-azacytidine potentiates initiation induced by carcinogens in rat liver.
51 patients with medically refractory Parkinson's disease underwent stereotactic posteromedial pallidotomy between August 1993 and February 1997 for treatment of bradykinesia, rigidity, and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. In 29 patients, the pallidotomies were performed with the Leksell Gamma Knife and in 22 they were performed with the standard radiofrequency (RF) method. Clinical assessment as well as blinded ratings of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores were carried out pre- and postoperatively. Mean follow-up time is 20.6 months (range 6-48) and all except 4 patients have been followed more than one year. 85 percent of patients with dyskinesias were relieved of symptoms, regardless of whether the pallidotomies were performed with the Gamma Knife or radiofrequency methods. About 2/3 of the patients in both Gamma Knife and radiofrequency groups showed improvements in bradykinesia and rigidity, although when considered as a group neither the Gamma Knife nor the radiofrequency group showed statistically significant improvements in UPDRS scores. One patient in the Gamma Knife group (3.4%) developed a homonymous hemianopsia 9 months following treatment and 5 patients (27.7%) in the radiofrequency group became transiently confused postoperatively. No other complications were seen. Gamma Knife pallidotomy is as effective as radiofrequency pallidotomy in controlling certain of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It may be the only practical technique available in certain patients, such as those who take anticoagulants, have bleeding diatheses or serious systemic medical illnesses. It is a viable option for other patients as well.

99mTc-glucarate for detection of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.
A (CTG) nexpansion in the 3-untranslated region (UTR) of the DM protein kinase gene (DMPK) is responsible for causing myotonic dystrophy (DM). Major instability, with very large expansions between generations and high levels of somatic mosaicism, is observed in patients. There is a good correlation between repeat size (at least in leucocytes), clinical severity and age of onset. The trinucleotide repeat instability mechanisms involved in DM and other human genetic diseases are unknown. We studied somatic instability by measuring the CTG repeat length at several ages in various tissues of transgenic mice carrying a (CTG) 55expansion surrounded by 45 kb of the human DM region, using small-pool PCR. These mice have been shown to reproduce the intergenerational and somatic instability of the 55 CTG repeat suggesting that surrounding sequences and the chromatin environment are involved in instability mechanisms. As observed in some of the tissues of DM patients, there is a tendency for repeat length and somatic mosaicism to increase with the age of the mouse. Furthermore, we observed no correlation between the somatic mutation rate and tissue proliferation capacity. The somatic mutation rates in different tissues were also not correlated to the relative inter-tissue difference in transcriptional levels of the three genes (DMAHP, DMPK and 59) surrounding the repeat..
A 1-year-old female presented with neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused by methylphenidate. She had defects in the supratentorial brain including the basal ganglia and the striatum (multicystic encephalomalacia) due to severe perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, which was considered to be a possible predisposing factor causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A dopaminergic blockade mechanism generally is accepted as the pathogenesis of this syndrome. However, methylphenidate is a dopamine agonist via the inhibition of uptake of dopamine, and therefore dopaminergic systems in the brainstem (mainly the midbrain) and the spinal cord were unlikely to participate in the onset of this syndrome. A relative gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic deficiency might occur because diazepam, a gamma-aminobutyric acid-mimetic agent, was strikingly effective. This is the first reported patient with neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused by methylphenidate.
A 1.1-Mb transcript map of the hereditary hemochromatosis locus.
A 10-year-old Laotian boy had homozygous deficiency of the third component of complement and recurrent bacterial infections beginning at age 5 months. Cellular and humoral immunity were normal, as were polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis and bactericidal activities. Serum complement-mediated hemolytic, chemotactic, and opsonic activities were deficient. In vitro addition of purified C3 to patient serum restored hemolytic complement to normal levels, and plasma infusion during each of four episodes of pneumonia significantly enhanced serum opsonic activity for as long as 36 hours. A renal biopsy specimen revealed mesangiopathic glomerulonephritis, although significant levels of circulating IgG immune complexes were not detected. These findings further support the association of C3 deficiency with immune-complex disease and suggest that plasma infusion may be an adjunct to antibiotic therapy in the management of severe pyogenic infections in patients with C3 deficiency..
A 10-year-old male with acute leukemia presented with post-chemotherapy anemia. During red cell transfusion, he developed hemoglobinuria. Transfusion reaction workup was negative. Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia was suspected because of positive direct antiglobulin test, negative eluate, and microspherocytes on smear pre- and post-transfusion. Drug studies using the indirect antiglobulin test were strongly positive with trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but negative with sulfamethoxazole. The patient recovered after discontinuing the drug, with no recurrence in 2 years. Other causes of anemia should be considered in patients with worse-than-expected anemia after chemotherapy. Furthermore, hemolysis during transfusion is not always a transfusion reaction.
A 12-kDa and two 25-kDa polypeptides were isolated with highly purified calf thymus DNA polymerase delta by conventional chromatography. A 16-mer peptide sequence was obtained from the 12-kDa polypeptide which matched a new open reading frame from a human EST () encoding a hypothetical protein of unknown function. The protein was designated as p12. Human EST was identified as the putative human homologue of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdm1 by a tBlastn search of the EST data base using S. pombe Cdm1. The open reading frame of human EST encoded a polypeptide of 107 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 12.4 kDa, consistent with the experimental findings. p12 is 25% identical to S pombe Cdm1. Both of the 25-kDa polypeptide sequences matched the hypothetical KIAA0039 protein sequence, recently identified as the third subunit of pol delta. Western blotting of immunoaffinity purified calf thymus pol delta revealed the presence of p125, p50, p68 (the KIAA0039 product), and p12. With the identification of p12 mammalian pol delta can now be shown to consist of four subunits. These studies pave the way for more detailed analysis of the possible functions of the mammalian subunits of pol delta.
A 12R-lipoxygenase in human skin: mechanistic evidence, molecular cloning, and expression.
A 1329-base pair clone isolated from a human placenta cDNA library contains a full-length 837-base pair coding region for a 31.9-kDa protein whose deduced primary structure exhibits high homology to consensus sequences found in other NMN adenylyltransferases. Northern blotting detected a major 3.1-kilobase mRNA transcript as well as a minor 4.1-kilobase transcript in all human tissues examined. In several cancer cell lines, lower levels of mRNA expression were clearly evident. The gene encoding the human enzyme was mapped to chromosome band 1p32-35. High efficiency bacterial expression yielded 1.5 mg of recombinant enzyme/liter of culture medium. The molecular and kinetic properties of recombinant human NMN adenylyltransferase provide new directions for investigating metabolic pathways involving this enzyme.
A 14-year-old girl is reported with recurrent, azithromycin-induced, acute interstitial nephritis. The second episode was more severe than the first; and although both were treated with intensive corticosteroid therapy, renal function remained impaired. Although most cases of antibiotic induced acute interstitial nephritis are benign and self-limited, some patients are at risk for permanent renal injury.
A 17-day-old infant on isoniazid therapy 13 mg/kg daily from birth because of maternal tuberculosis was admitted after 4 days of clonic fits. No underlying infective or biochemical cause could be found. The fits ceased within 4 hours of administering intramuscular pyridoxine, suggesting an aetiology of pyridoxine deficiency secondary to isoniazid medication.
A 2 year old female presenting with bilateral sporadic aniridia was found to have an apparently balanced reciprocal translocation with a chromosome 11 breakpoint within band p13. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) studies with distal 11p13 specific cosmids showed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint lay between the aniridia (PAX6) locus and a region approximately 100 kb distal to PAX6 defined by the cosmid FO2121. Although this patient did not have a detectable deletion within PAX6, her aniridia may have resulted from a disruption of the distal chromatin domain containing either enhancers or regulators for PAX6. This case may therefore be another example of aniridia caused by a position effect as recently described in two familial aniridia patients in which the phenotype cosegregated with chromosome abnormalities with 11p13 breakpoints..
A 2-year-old child with known neurologic impairment developed a dyskinesia soon after starting phenobarbital therapy for seizures. Known causes of movement disorders were eliminated after evaluation. On repeat challenge with phenobarbital, the dyskinesia recurred. Phenobarbital should be added to the list of anticonvulsant drugs that can cause movement disorders.
A 23-year-old male patient with bacteriologically proven pulmonary tuberculosis was treated with the various regimens of antituberculosis drugs for nearly 15 months. Rifampicin was administered thrice as one of the 3-4 drug regimen and each time he developed untoward side effects like nausea, vomiting and fever with chills and rigors. The last such episode was of acute renal failure at which stage the patient was seen by the authors of this report. The patient, however, made a full recovery.
A 24 year old male with a history of eczema, recurrent mild infections, and thrombocytopenia consistent with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) presented with a mediastinal mass, generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and severe thrombocytopenia. Studies of immune function including immunoglobulin levels and T-cell subsets were normal. Furthermore, his T lymphocytes proliferated normally in response to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and the combination of neuraminidase/galactose oxidase. However, their proliferative responses to anti-CD43 antibody and periodate were diminished, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of WAS. An initial inguinal lymph node biopsy surprisingly revealed Kaposi sarcoma. However, following splenectomy to increase the platelet count, biopsy of the mediastinal mass revealed T-cell large cell lymphoma. Studies of biopsied tissue for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus were negative, as were studies of blood, including the polymerase chain reaction, for the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is the first report of Kaposi sarcoma arising in a patient with a congenital immunodeficiency syndrome. Although Kaposi sarcoma can arise in the face of the severe immunosuppression that follows allograft transplantation and in patients infected with HIV, we postulate that longevity in the face of mild immunosuppression was the major factor in the development of Kaposi sarcoma in this patient..
A 27-year old African woman with history of regular chloroquine ingestion presented with progressive deterioration of vision, easy fatiguability, dyspnoea, dizziness progressing to syncopal attacks. Ophthalmological assessment revealed features of chloroquine retinopathy, cardiac assessment revealed features of heart failure and a complete heart block with right bundle branch block pattern. The heart block was treated by pacemaker insertion and the heart failure resolved spontaneously following chloroquine discontinuation. She however remains blind.
A 27-year-old male patient presented with a maculopapular eruption on the flexural areas and buttocks after using oral ketoconazole. The patient was diagnosed with drug-induced baboon syndrome based on his history, which included prior sensitivity to topical ketoconazole, a physical examination, and histopathological findings. Baboon syndrome is a drug- or contact allergen-related maculopapular eruption that typically involves the flexural and gluteal areas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of ketoconazole-induced baboon syndrome in the English literature.
A 27-yr-old man developed jaundice 2 wk after exposure to thiabendazole. Cholestasis persisted for 3 yr, at which time a liver transplant was performed. Two liver biopsy specimens and the hepatectomy specimen were remarkable for almost complete disappearance of interlobular bile ducts. Prominent fibrosis and hepatocellular regeneration were also present; however, the lobular architecture was preserved. This case represents an example of "idiosyncratic" drug-induced liver damage in which the primary target of injury is the bile duct. An autoimmune pathogenesis of the bile duct destruction is suggested.
A 29-year-old woman with discoid lupus erythematosus had undetectable classic pathway complement activity. Hypocomplementemia was due to selective deficiency of C5. One of her children was also deficient. To our knowledge this is the first documented case of an association between discoid lupus erythematosus and C5 deficiency..
A 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene results in a kinetic variant of phenylketonuria.
A 3-year-old girl had behavioral deterioration, with hyperkinesis, irritability, and sleeping difficulties after the therapeutic administration of isoniazid. The administration of pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine hydrochloride led to a disappearance of symptoms. After discontinuing isoniazid therapy a similar pattern of behavior was noted that was controlled by pyridoxine. A placebo had no effect, but niacinamide was as effective as pyridoxine. Periodic withdrawal of pyridoxine was associated with return of the hyperkinesis. The level of pyridoxal in the blood was normal during the periods of relapse. Metabolic studies suggested a block in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. The patient has been followed for six years and has required pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine to control her behavior.
A 3.4-kbp transcript of ZNF331 is solely expressed in follicular thyroid adenomas.
A 30-year-old cocaine-dependent man who was a subject in a study evaluating the anticraving efficacy of the stimulant medication diethylpropion (DEP) became manic during his second week on the study drug. Pupillometric changes while on DEP, especially changes in the total power of pupillary oscillation, were dramatically different than those observed in the eight other study subjects who did not become manic. The large changes in total power of pupillary oscillation occurred a few days before the patient became fully manic. Such medication-associated changes in the total power of pupillary oscillation might be of utility in identifying persons at risk for manic-like adverse effects during the medical use of psychomotor stimulants or sympathomimetic agents.
A 31-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis, who had previously been treated with sulindac, fenoprofen calcium, high dose salicylates and gold salts, developed renal papillary necrosis (RPN) 4 months after institution of naproxen therapy. No other factor predisposing to RPN could be discovered. Sulindac was substituted for naproxen and no further adverse renal effects occurred over the next 12 months. We review previous reports linking RPN to antiinflammatory drug use and discuss possible advantages of sulindac in patients who have experienced renal toxicity from other antiinflammatory agents.
A 34-year-old lady developed a constellation of dermatitis, fever, lymphadenopathy and hepatitis, beginning on the 17th day of a course of oral sulphasalazine for sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis. Cervical and inguinal lymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising lymphadenitis, associated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates, without viral inclusion bodies, suggestive of an adverse drug reaction.A week later, fulminant drug-induced hepatitis, associated with the presence of anti-nuclear autoantibodies (but not with other markers of autoimmunity), and accompanied by multi-organ failure and sepsis, supervened. She subsequently died some 5 weeks after the commencement of her drug therapy.Post-mortem examination showed evidence of massive hepatocellular necrosis, acute hypersensitivity myocarditis, focal acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis and extensive bone marrow necrosis, with no evidence of malignancy. It is thought that the clinico-pathological features and chronology of this case bore the hallmarks of the so-called "3-week sulphasalazine syndrome", a rare, but often fatal, immunoallergic reaction to sulphasalazine.
A 34-year-old patient developed metastic endometrial carcinoma after Hodgkin disease in childhood. She had ovarian failure after abdominal irradiation and chemotherapy for Hodgkin disease, and received exogenous estrogens, a treatment implicated in the development of endometrial cancer in menopausal women. Young women on replacement estrogens for ovarian failure after cancer therapy may also have increased risk of endometrial carcinoma and should be examined periodically.
A 4-megabase YAC contig that spans the Langer-Giedion syndrome region on human chromosome 8q24.1: use in refining the location of the trichorhinophalangeal syndrome and multiple exostoses genes (TRPS1 and EXT1).
A 40-year-old man with childhood-onset Tourette syndrome (TS) developed Huntington disease (HD). We believe this to be the first reported case of childhood-onset TS with adult onset HD. Discovery of other cases with both disorders may provide clues to the pathophysiology of both conditions..
A 41-year-old woman with a strong history of postoperative nausea and vomiting presented for abdominal hysterectomy 3 months after a previous anaesthetic where ondansetron prophylaxis had been used. She had developed a severe acute major depression disorder almost immediately thereafter, possibly related to the use of a serotonin antagonist. Nine years before she had experienced a self-limited puerperal depressive episode. Anaesthesia with a propofol infusion and avoidance of serotonin antagonists provided a nausea-free postoperative course without exacerbation of the depression disorder.
A 45-year-old man, with a 10-year history of manic depression treated with lithium, was admitted with hyperosmolar, nonketotic coma. He gave a five-year history of polyuria and polydipsia, during which time urinalysis had been negative for glucose. After recovery from hyperglycaemia, he remained polyuric despite normal blood glucose concentrations; water deprivation testing indicated nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, likely to be lithium-induced. We hypothesize that when this man developed type 2 diabetes, chronic polyuria due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus was sufficient to precipitate hyperosmolar dehydration.
A 46-year old man with a chronic hepatitis C virus infection received triple therapy with ribavirin, pegylated interferon and telaprevir. The patient also received simvastatin. One month after starting the antiviral therapy, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he developed rhabdomyolysis. At admission simvastatin and all antiviral drugs were discontinued because toxicity due to a drug-drug interaction was suspected. The creatine kinase peaked at 62,246 IU/L and the patient was treated with intravenous normal saline. The patient's renal function remained unaffected. Fourteen days after hospitalization, creatine kinase level had returned to 230 IU/L and the patient was discharged. Telaprevir was considered the probable causative agent of an interaction with simvastatin according to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale. The interaction is due to inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated simvastatin clearance. Simvastatin plasma concentration increased 30 times in this patient and statin induced muscle toxicity is related to the concentration of the statin in blood. In conclusion, with this case we illustrate that telaprevir as well as statins are susceptible to clinical relevant drug-drug interactions.
A 47-year-old man who had been taking minocycline for palmoplantar pustulosis developed fever, myalgias, polyneuropathy, and testicular pain, with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Neither myeloperoxidase- nor proteinase-3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody was positive. These manifestations met the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of polyarteritis nodosa. Stopping minocycline led to amelioration of symptoms and normalization of CRP level. To our knowledge, this is the second case of minocycline-induced vasculitis satisfying the criteria. Differential diagnosis for drug-induced disease is invaluable even for patients with classical polyarteritis nodosa.
A 47-year-old patient suffering from coronary artery disease was admitted to the CCU in shock with III. AV block, severe hypotension, and impairment of ventricular function. One week prior to admission a therapy with standard doses of metoprolol (100 mg t.i.d. and then 100 mg b.i.d.) had been initiated. Two days before admission diltiazem (60 mg b.i.d.) was prescribed in addition. Analyses of a blood sample revealed unusually high plasma concentrations of metoprolol (greater than 3000 ng/ml) and diltiazem (526 ng/ml). The patient recovered within 1 week following discontinuation of antianginal therapy. Three months later the patient was exposed to a single dose of metoprolol, diltiazem, propafenone (since he had received this drug in the past), and sparteine (as a probe for the debrisoquine/sparteine type polymorphism of oxidative drug metabolism). It was found that he was a poor metabolizer of all four drugs, indicating that their metabolism is under the same genetic control. Therefore, patients belonging to the poor-metabolizer phenotype of sparteine/debrisoquine polymorphism in drug metabolism, which constitutes 6.4% of the German population, may experience adverse drug reactions when treated with standard doses of one of these drugs alone. Moreover, the coadministration of these frequently used drugs is expected to be especially harmful in this subgroup of patients.
A 47-year-old woman presented for mastectomy and immediate latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction having been diagnosed with carcinoma of the breast 6 months previously. In the preceding months she had received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin, paclitaxel (Taxol) and cyclophosphamide. This had been apparently uncomplicated and she had maintained a remarkably high level of physical activity. She was found to be bradycardic at pre-operative assessment but had no cardiac symptoms. Second degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block was diagnosed on electrocardiogram, and temporary transvenous ventricular pacing instituted in the peri-operative period. We discuss how evidence-based guidelines would not have been helpful in this case, and how chemotherapy can exhibit substantial cardiotoxicity that may develop over many years. We suggest that patients who have received chemotherapy at any time should have a pre-operative electrocardiogram even if they are asymptomatic.
A 47-year-old woman with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) was found to have an inherited deficiency in the ninth complement component (C9). In complement-sensitivity lysis tests, 80% of her erythrocytes were markedly complement-sensitive (PNH-III). Laser cytofluorimetry with a monoclonal antibody against decay-accelerating factor (DAF) revealed that 95% of her erythrocytes were DAF-negative. Surprisingly, she has suffered only mild haemolysis and has never experienced massive spontaneous haemolysis. Gross haemoglobinuria and jaundice occurred only after receiving postoperative transfusion of whole blood. In her serum, C9 was not detectable either by immunological or by functional assays. Both the Ham test and the sugar water test using normal human serum or plasma yielded marked haemolysis of the patients erythrocytes. When the patients serum or plasma was used, only a trace of lysis was detected. Addition of purified human C9 to her plasma fully restored haemolysis. These observations indicated that C9 may play a critical role in haemolytic attacks in patients with PNH and that characteristic haemolysis in PNH may be tempered by coexisting C9 deficiency..
A 47-year-old woman with right hydroureteronephrosis due to ureterovesical junction obstruction had gross hematuria after being treated for five years wtih cyclophosphamide for cerebral vasculitis. A right nephroureterectomy was required for control of bleeding. The pathology specimen contained clinically occult invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis. Although the ability of cyclophosphamide to cause hemorrhagic cystitis and urine cytologic abnormalities indistinguishable from high grade carcinoma is well known, it is less widely appreciated that it is also associated with carcinoma of the urinary tract. Twenty carcinomas of the urinary bladder and one carcinoma of the prostate have been reported in association with its use. The present case is the first carcinoma of the renal pelvis reported in association with cyclophosphamide treatment. It is the third urinary tract cancer reported in association with cyclophosphamide treatment for nonmalignant disease. The association of the tumor with preexisting hydroureteronephrosis suggests that stasis prolonged and intensified exposure of upper urinary tract epithelium to cyclophosphamide. Patients who are candidates for long-term cyclophosphamide treatment should be routinely evaluated for obstructive uropathy.
A 51 year old man took a mixed overdose including 1.8-3.6 g of diltiazem, paracetamol, aspirin, isosorbide nitrate, and alcohol. He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild hypotension and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids. Eighteen hours after the overdose he had two generalised tonic-clonic seizures. The patient remained unresponsive with junctional bradycardia, unrecordable blood pressure, and then became asystolic. He was resuscitated with high dose (13.5 g) intravenous calcium and adrenaline (epinephrine). He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours. This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy in severe diltiazem overdose, particularly with the onset of asystole. It should be considered early in cases of cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose. The case also highlights the problems with delayed toxicity when whole bowel irrigation is not administered.
A 51/2-year-old black girl with recurrent meningococcal meningitis and absence of the sixth component of complement (C6) is reported. To explore the pathogenesis of recurrent neisserial infections in C6 deficiency, a detailed analysis of her immune competence was conducted. Her serum had normal chemotactic, opsonic, alternative complement pathway, and specific antibody activity, but lacked complement-mediated bacteriolytic activity. In addition, her C6-deficient serum was indistinguishable from normal serum in a complement-dependent assay of phagocyte bactericidal activity. Absent bacteriolysis remains the only consistent defect associated with recurrent neisserial infections and absence of one of the late-acting complement components..
A 54-year-old hypothyroid male taking thyroxine and simvastatin presented with bilateral leg compartment syndrome and myonecrosis. Urgent fasciotomies were performed and the patient made an uneventful recovery with the withdrawal of simvastatin. It is likely that this complication will be seen more often with the increased worldwide use of this drug and its approval for all arteriopathic patients.
A 54-year-old man with severe left ventricular dysfunction due to dilated cardiomyopathy was referred to our hospital for symptomatic incessant sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). After the administration of nifekalant hydrochloride, sustained VT was terminated. An alternate class III agent, sotalol, was also effective for the prevention of VT. However, one month after switching over nifekalant to sotalol, a short duration of ST elevation was documented in ECG monitoring at almost the same time for three consecutive days. ST elevation with chest discomfort disappeared since he began taking long-acting diltiazem. Coronary vasospasm may be induced by the non-selective beta-blocking properties of sotalol.
A 59-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis developed red eyes, pleural effusion, eosinophilia and urinary abnormalities after restarting of sulphasalazine treatment. Light microscopy of a kidney biopsy revealed segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis without deposition of immunoglobulin or complement. Proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) titer was elevated at 183 ELISA units (EU) in sera (normal range less than 10 EU), myeloperoxidase-ANCA was negative. PR3-ANCA titer was 250 and 1,070 EU in pleural effusions on right and left side, respectively. Although cessation of sulphasalazine treatment resulted in improvements in fever, red eyes, chest pain, titer of C-reactive protein and volume of the pleural effusions, we initiated steroid therapy, because PR3-ANCA titer rose to 320 EU, eosinophil count increased to 1,100 cells/microl, and the pleural effusion remained. One month after steroid therapy, the pleural effusion disappeared, and PR3-ANCA titer normalized 3 months later. This case suggests that sulphasalazine can induce PR3-ANCA-positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis.
A 6-week open study of the introduction of isradipine treatment was conducted in general practice in Hong Kong. 303 Chinese patients with mild to moderate hypertension entered the study. Side effects were reported in 21% of patients and caused withdrawal from the study in 3 patients. The main side-effects were headache, dizziness, palpitation and flushing and these were not more frequent than reported in other studies with isradipine or with placebo. Supine blood pressure was reduced (P less than 0.01) from 170 +/- 20/102 +/- 6 mmHg to 153 +/- 19/92 +/- 8, 147 +/- 18/88 +/- 7 and 144 +/- 14/87 +/- 6 mmHg at 2, 4 and 6 weeks respectively in evaluable patients. Similar reductions occurred in standing blood pressure and there was no evidence of postural hypotension. Normalization and responder rates at 6 weeks were 86% and 69% respectively. Dosage was increased from 2.5 mg b.d. to 5 mg b.d. at 4 weeks in patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg and their further response was greater than those remaining on 2.5 mg b.d.
A 61 year old female developed fatal hepatic failure after phenytoin administration. A typical multisystem clinical pattern precedes the manifestations of hepatic injury. The hematologic, biochemical and pathologic features indicate a mixed hepatocellular damage due to drug hypersensitivity. In a patient receiving phenytoin who presents a viral-like illness, early recognition and discontinuation of the drug are mandatory.
A 61-year-old Japanese man with nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was initially responding well to steroid therapy. The amount of daily urinary protein decreased from 15.6 to 2.8 g. Within 14 days of the oral bisphosphonate (alendronate sodium) administration, the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12.8 g with acute renal failure. After discontinuing the oral alendronate, the patient underwent six cycles of hemodialysis and four cycles of LDL apheresis. Urinary volume and serum creatinine levels recovered to the normal range, with urinary protein disappearing completely within 40 days. This report demonstrates that not only intravenous, but also oral bisphosphonates can aggravate proteinuria and acute renal failure.
A 61-year-old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating cisplatinum, etoposide, high-dose 5-fluorouracil (2,250 mg/m2/24 hours) and folinic acid for an inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma. He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental confusion, disorientation and irritability, and then lapsed into a deep coma, lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose (day 2) of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid infusion. This complication reappeared on day 25 during the second dose of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid, which were then the only drugs given. Because folinic acid was unlikely to be associated with this condition, neurotoxicity due to high-dose 5-fluorouracil was highly suspected. The pathogenesis of 5-fluorouracil neurotoxicity may be due to a Krebs cycle blockade by fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate, thiamine deficiency, or dihydrouracil dehydrogenase deficiency. High-dose 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid infusion therapy has recently become a popular regimen for various cancers. It is necessary that both oncologists and neurologists be fully aware of this unusual complication.
A 62-year-old man was found to have bradycardia, hypothermia and respiratory failure 3 weeks after initiation of amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was found to be 168 uIU/mL (nl. 0.3-5 uIU/mL) and free thyroxine (FT4) was <0.2 ng/dL (nl. 0.8-1.8 ng/dL). He received intravenous fluids, vasopressor therapy and stress dose steroids; he was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit. He received 500 ug of intravenous levothyroxine in the first 18 h of therapy, and 150 ug intravenous daily thereafter. Haemodynamic improvement, along with complete recovery of mental status, occurred after 48 h. Twelve hours after the initiation of therapy, FT4 was 0.96 ng/dL. The patient was maintained on levothyroxine 175 (g POorally daily. A thyroid ultrasound showed diffuse heterogeneity. The 24 hour excretion of iodine was 3657 (mcg (25-756 ( mcg). The only two cases of amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma in the literature report patient death despite supportive therapy and thyroid hormone replacement. This case represents the most thoroughly investigated case of amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma with a history significant for subclinical thyroid disease.
A 63-year-old male experienced sudden diplopia after 9 weeks of administration of pegylated interferon (IFN) alpha-2b and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Ophthalmologic examinations showed ptosis on the right upper lid and restricted right eye movement without any other neurological signs. A brain imaging study and repetitive nerve stimulation test indicated no abnormality. The acetylcholine receptor antibody titer and response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were negative, and the results of thyroid function tests were normal. The patient's ophthalmological symptoms improved rapidly 3 weeks after discontinuation of pegylated IFN alpha-2b and ribavirin. The ocular myasthenia associated with combination therapy of pegylated IFN alpha-2b and ribavirin for CHC is very rarely reported; therefore, we present this case with a review of the various eye complications of IFN therapy.
A 65-year-old man with advanced renal cell carcinoma was admitted due to continuing chest pain at rest. Two weeks before his admission, sorafenib had been started. He was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction by laboratory data and electrocardiogram. Enhanced heart magnetic resonance imaging also showed subendocardial infarction. However, there was no stenosis in coronary arteries on angiography. Coronary artery spasm was induced by a provocative test. Cessation of sorafenib and administration of Ca-channel blocker and nitrates ameliorated his symptoms, but relapse occurred after resumption of sorafenib. Addition of oral nicorandil reduced his symptoms and maintained stable angina status. We report the first case of sorafenib-induced coronary artery spasm. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways necessary for cellular proliferation and survival. On the other hand, the Rho/ROCK pathway has an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery spasm. Our report may show an adverse effect on the Rho/ROCK pathway by sorafenib use.
A 65-year-old woman with adult-onset diabetes treated with chlorpropamide (Diabenese) had a toxic optic neuropathy that resolved with discontinuation of chlorpropamide therapy. Visual loss occurs in diabetics for a variety of reasons, and accurate diagnosis is necessary to institute appropriate therapy. The possibility of a drug-induced optic neuropathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of visual loss in diabetics.
A 67-year-old man who was treated with oxacillin for one week because of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, developed renal failure and diffuse, symmetric, palpable purpuric lesions on his feet. Necrotic blisters were noted on his fingers. Skin biopsies showed findings diagnostic of leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Oxacillin was discontinued and patient was treated with corticosteroids. The rash disappeared after three weeks and renal function returned to normal. Leucocytoclastic vasculitis presents as palpable purpura of the lower extremities often accompanied by abdominal pain, arthralgia, and renal involvement. Etiologic factors or associated disorders include infections, medications, collagen vascular disease and neoplasia. However, in half of the cases no etiologic factor is identified. Usually it is a self-limited disorder, but corticosteroid therapy may be needed in life-threatening cases since early treatment with corticosteroids in severe cases can prevent complications. Oxacillin should be included among the drugs that can cause leucocytoclastic vasculitis.
A 67-year-old patient, with primary polymyositis and without previous evidence of liver disease, developed clinical and biochemical features of severe cholestasis 3 months after initiation of azathioprine therapy. Liver biopsy showed cholestasis with both cytological and architectural alterations of interlobular bile ducts. Azathioprine withdrawal resulted after 7 weeks in the resolution of clinical and biochemical abnormalities. It is believed that this is the first reported case of reversible azathioprine-induced cholestasis associated with histological evidence of bile duct injury.
A 67-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis presented rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) after 5 months of D-penicillamine (250 mg/day) treatment. Light microscopy study showed severe glomerulonephritis with crescent formation in 60% of the glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wall of an arteriole. Immunofluorescence revealed scanty granular IgG, IgA and C3 deposits along the capillary walls and mesangium. The patient was treated with steroid pulse, plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide and antiplatelet agents. A complete recovery of renal function was achieved in a few weeks. This new case of RPGN in the course of D-penicillamine treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and proteinuria in these patients. The prompt discontinuation of D-penicillamine and vigorous treatment measures could allow for a good prognosis as in this case.
A 69-year-old man operated for acute cholecystitis under methoxyflurane anesthesia developed postoperatively a hepatic insufficiency syndrome and renal tubular acidosis. Massive bleeding appeared during surgery which lasted for six hours. Postoperative evolution under supportive therapy was favourable. Complete recovery was confirmed by repeated controls performed over a period of one year after surgery.
A 69-yr-old man, who was concurrently being treated with pilocarpine nitrate and timolol maleate eye drops, developed a bradycardia and became hypotensive during halothane anaesthesia. Both timolol and pilocarpine were subsequently identified in a 24-h collection of urine. Timolol (but not pilocarpine) was detected in a sample of plasma removed during surgery; the plasma concentration of timolol (2.6 ng ml-1) was consistent with partial beta-adrenoceptor blockade. It is postulated that this action may have been enhanced during halothane anaesthesia with resultant bradycardia and hypotension. Pilocarpine may have had a contributory effect.
A 6Mb deletion in band 2q22 due to a complex chromosome rearrangement associated with severe psychomotor retardation, microcephaly and distinctive dysmorphic facial features.
A 7-year-old girl with an unusual reaction to induction chemotherapy for precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is described. The patient developed acute encephalopathy evidenced by behavioral changes, aphasia, incontinence, visual hallucinations, and right-sided weakness with diffuse cerebral vasospasm on magnetic resonance angiography after the administration of intrathecal cytarabine. Vincristine, dexamethasone, and polyethylene glycol-asparaginase were also administered before the episode as part of induction therapy. Neurologic status returned to baseline within 10 days of the acute event, and magnetic resonance angiography findings returned to normal 4 months later.
A 71-kilodalton protein is a major product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in brain and other nonmuscle tissues.
A 72-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with "flash" pulmonary edema, preceded by chest pain, requiring intubation. Her medical history included coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarctions, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. A history of angioedema secondary to lisinopril therapy was elicited. Current medications did not include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers. She had no previous beta-blocking drug exposure. During the first day of hospitalization (while intubated), intravenous metoprolol was given, resulting in severe angioedema. The angioedema resolved after therapy with intravenous steroids and diphenhydramine hydrochloride.
A 73-year-old woman died of aplastic anemia less than two months after undergoing cataract extraction and beginning topical therapy with chloramphenicol. The first signs of pancytopenia began within one month of the surgery. The pattern of the aplastic anemia was associated with an idiosyncratic response to chloramphenicol. This was the second report of fatal aplastic anemia after topical treatment with chloramphenicol for ocular conditions, although two cases of reversible bone marrow hypoplasia have also been reported. Any other suspected cases of ocular toxicity associated with topically applied chloramphenicol should be reported to the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR 97201.
A 74-year-old man with depressive symptoms was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to insomnia, loss of appetite, exhaustion, and agitation. Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1.2 mg alprazolam. On the 10th day of paroxetine and alprazolam treatment, the patient exhibited marked psychomotor retardation, disorientation, and severe muscle rigidity with tremors. The patient had a fever (38.2 degrees C), fluctuating blood pressure (between 165/90 and 130/70 mg mm Hg), and severe extrapyramidal symptoms. Laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase (2218 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (134 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (78 IU/L), and BUN (27.9 mg/ml) levels. The patient received bromocriptine and diazepam to treat his symptoms. 7 days later, the fever disappeared and the patient's serum CPK levels were normalized (175 IU/L). This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), thus demonstrating that NMS-like symptoms can occur after combined paroxetine and alprazolam treatment. The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case, indicating a probable relationship between the patient's NMS-like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case. The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected. Several risk factors for NMS should be noted in elderly depressive patients whose symptoms often include dehydration, agitation, malnutrition, and exhaustion. Careful therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients who suffer from depression.
A 76 year-old woman with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting and prior myocardial infarction was transferred to the emergency room with loss of consciousness due to marked bradycardia caused by hyperkalemia. The concentration of serum potassium was high, and normal sinus rhythm was restored after correction of the serum potassium level. The cause of hyperkalemia was considered to be several doses of spiranolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, in addition to the long-term intake of ramipril, an ACE inhibitor. This case is a good example of electrolyte imbalance causing acute life-threatening cardiac events. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of hyperkalemia, especially in elderly patients using ACE/ARB in combination with potassium sparing agents and who have mild renal disturbance.
A 77-y-old patient developed weakness of extremities, legs paralysis, dysarthria and tremor 1 h after ingestion of 200 mg ketoconazole for the first time in his life. All complaints faded away within 24 h. Few days later, the patient used another 200 mg ketoconazole tablet, and within an hour experienced a similar clinical picture, which resolved again spontaneously within hours. Laboratory evaluations, including head CT scan, were normal. This case illustrates the need for close vigilance in adverse drug reactions, particularly in the elderly.
A 77-year-old woman presented with subacute onset progressive confusion, aggression, auditory hallucinations and delusions. In the preceding months, the patient had a number of admissions with transient unilateral hemiparesis with facial droop, and had been started on valproate for presumed hemiplegic migraine. Valproate was withdrawn soon after admission and her cognitive abilities have gradually improved over 3 months of follow-up. Valproate levels taken prior to withdrawal were subtherapeutic and the patient was normoammonaemic. EEG undertaken during inpatient stay showed changes consistent with encephalopathy, and low titre N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies were present in this patient. The possible aetiologies of valproate-induced encephalopathy and NMDA receptor-associated encephalitis present a diagnostic dilemma. We present a putative combinatorial hypothesis to explain this patient's symptoms.
A 77-year-old woman with refractory multiple myeloma was treated with a 4-day continuous intravenous infusion of vincristine and doxorubicin and 4 days of oral dexamethasone. Nine days after her second cycle she presented with lethargy and weakness associated with hyponatremia. Evaluation revealed the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, which was attributed to the vincristine infusion. After normal serum sodium levels returned, further doxorubicin and dexamethasone chemotherapy without vincristine did not produce this complication.
A 78-year-old with healed septal necrosis suffered a recurrent myocardial infarction of the anterior wall following the administration of isosorbide dinitrate 5 mg sublingually. After detailing the course of events, we discuss the role of paradoxical coronary spasm and hypotension-mediated myocardial ischemia occurring downstream to significant coronary arterial stenosis in the pathophysiology of acute coronary insufficiency.
A C--greater than G transversion has been found in exon 3 of the PLP gene of affected males and their mother in a single sibship with Pelizaeus-merzbacher disease (PMD). The transversion should not result in an amino acid change in the protein but it does result in the loss of a HaeIII restriction endonuclease cleavage site. It is concordant with the disease in this family. One-hundred-ten unrelated X chromosomes are negative for this mutation. No other sequence defect was found in the PLP exons of the affected males. The cause of disease in this family remains unknown, but the association between this rare mutation and PMD is intriguing. The mutation can serve as a marker for following segregation of the PLP gene..
A C-terminal inhibitory domain controls the activity of p63 by an intramolecular mechanism.
A C-to-T transition in exon 4 of the PLP gene was found in 2 affected males and two obligate carriers in a German family with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. The mutation, which causes loss of an HphI site and changes amino acid 155 from threonine to isoleucine, was absent from 108 normal chromosomes. There are 5 concordances and 1 discrepancy between these results and those obtained by magnetic resonance imaging in this family..
A C825T polymorphism of the gene encoding the G protein beta3 subunit (GNB3) is associated with enhanced G protein activity and increased intracellular signal transduction. The 825T allele has been implicated in the development of hypertension in some ethnic groups, especially in whites. Studies in Asians and blacks are more controversial, and little information is available on this polymorphism in the susceptibility to hypertension in the Chinese population. Furthermore, the inconsistency between studies may be due to genetic heterogeneity of the population selected and/or the lack of statistical power. We investigated the relationship of this polymorphism with hypertension in two independent northern Chinese populations using both a case-control and a family-based study design. The GNB3 C825T polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion. In the case-control study which included 585 hypertensive case subjects and 580 normotensive control subjects there was no significant association between the polymorphism and hypertension status or blood pressure levels. The lack of association was confirmed by the results obtained in 181 hypertensive families using both transmission disequilibrium test and sib transmission disequilibrium test. No preferential transmission was observed for the GNB3 825T allele to the affected subjects. Furthermore, there was no significant association between the polymorphism and body mass index in the case-control study. Therefore our work does not provide evidence in favor of GNB3 C825T being a candidate gene for conferring genetic susceptibility to hypertension or obesity in northern Chinese population.
A Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait (AE) and leprosy developed a Heinz body hemolytic anemia while taking a dose of dapsone (50 mg/day) not usually associated with clinical hemolysis. Her red blood cells (RBCs) had increased incubated Heinz body formation, decreased reduced glutathione (GSH), and decreased GSH stability. The pentose phosphate shunt activity of the dapsone-exposed AE RBCs was increased compared to normal RBCs. Although the AE RBCs from an individual not taking dapsone had increased incubated Heinz body formation, the GSH content and GSH stability were normal. The pentose phosphate shunt activity of the non-dapsone-exposed AE RBCs was decreased compared to normal RBCs. Thus, AE RBCs appear to have an increased sensitivity to oxidant stress both in vitro and in vivo, since dapsone does not cause hemolytic anemia at this dose in hematologically normal individuals. Given the influx of Southeast Asians into the United States, oxidant medications should be used with caution, especially if an infection is present, in individuals of ethnic backgrounds that have an increased prevalence of hemoglobin E.
A Case of Sudden Cardiac Death due to Pilsicainide-Induced Torsades de Pointes.
A DNA marker C7, localised Xp21. 1-Xp21. 3, has been studied in kindreds segregating for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). In DMD families four crossovers were observed in 38 informative meioses between C7 and the DMD locus (theta = 0. 12, z max = + 2. 72). In BMD families no recombinants were observed in the 16 informative meioses studied. These data are consistent with the localisation of the mutations in these disorders being in the same region of Xp21. Studies in families also segregating for the DNA marker 754 support the previously reported physical order of these loci as X centromere-754-DMD-BMD-C7-X telomere. A recombination fraction of 0. 11 (z max = + 5. 58) was found between DMD-754 by combining our previously published data with the data presented here. C7 and 754 thus provide good bridging markers for the diagnosis of DMD and BMD

A Phase I study of intravenous (IV) bolus 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin (Pirarubicin) was done in 55 patients in good performance status with refractory tumors. Twenty-six had minimal prior therapy (good risk), 23 had extensive prior therapy (poor risk), and six had renal and/or hepatic dysfunction. A total of 167 courses at doses of 15 to 70 mg/m2 were evaluable. Maximum tolerated dose in good-risk patients was 70 mg/m2, and in poor-risk patients, 60 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxic effect was transient noncumulative granulocytopenia. Granulocyte nadir was on day 14 (range, 4-22). Less frequent toxic effects included thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, mild alopecia, phlebitis, and mucositis. Myelosuppression was more in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Pharmacokinetic analyses in 21 patients revealed Pirarubicin plasma T 1/2 alpha (+/- SE) of 2.5 +/- 0.85 minutes, T beta 1/2 of 25.6 +/- 6.5 minutes, and T 1/2 gamma of 23.6 +/- 7.6 hours. The area under the curve was 537 +/- 149 ng/ml x hours, volume of distribution (Vd) 3504 +/- 644 l/m2, and total clearance (ClT) was 204 + 39.3 l/hour/m2. Adriamycinol, doxorubicin, adriamycinone, and tetrahydropyranyladriamycinol were the metabolites detected in plasma and the amount of doxorubicin was less than or equal to 10% of the total metabolites. Urinary excretion of Pirarubicin in the first 24 hours was less than or equal to 10%. Activity was noted in mesothelioma, leiomyosarcoma, and basal cell carcinoma. The recommended starting dose for Phase II trials is 60 mg/m2 IV bolus every 3 weeks.

A SMAD ubiquitin ligase targets the BMP pathway and affects embryonic pattern formation.
A Saudi Arab boy presented in early childhood with thrombocytopenia, morphologically large and normal sized platelets, increased mean platelet volume, and a hypermegakaryocytic bone marrow. There was no clinical and laboratory evidence of any significant immunological abnormalities. Similar findings in two other brothers suggested strongly that they were all suffering from an X linked recessive thrombocytopenic disorder. Results of DNA analysis with the probe M27 beta are consistent with X linkage and indicate also that the locus of the relevant gene lies close to or is identical to the locus of the gene for the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). Because of various features which include the presence of large and normal sized platelets (rather than small platelets) and freedom from significant immune deficiencies, it is likely that the X linked recessive thrombocytopenia in this family is an isolated entity quite distinct from the classical WAS phenotype. However, a modified expression of the WAS gene producing a mild phenotypic variant cannot be excluded entirely..
A beta-arrestin/green fluorescent protein biosensor for detecting G protein-coupled receptor activation.
A boy developed contractures of the Achilles tendons at 3 years and of the postcervical muscles at 7 years, although neither contractures of the elbows nor cardiac abnormality were recognized by the age of 9 years. Muscle computed tomography scanning revealed changes characteristic of muscle involvement. Emerin was not detected in the biopsied muscle, and RT-PCR and PCR-based genomic DNA analyses of the emerin gene demonstrated no amplification product in the patient. These results confirmed the diagnosis of X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), and reinforce the necessity of molecular genetic diagnosis of the membrane protein emerin in younger patients with possible EDMD before appearance of the typical symptoms, to avoid sudden cardiac death..
A cDNA encoding UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-R (GlcNAc to GalNAc) beta 1-6GlcNAc transferase (EC 2.4.1.102), which forms critical branches in O-glycans, has been isolated by an expression cloning approach using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Increased activity of this enzyme and the concomitant occurrence of the O-glycan core 2 structure [Gal beta 1-3(GlcNAc beta 1-6)GalNAc] has been observed in a variety of biological processes, such as T-cell activation and immunodeficiency due to the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and AIDS. Since CHO cells do not express this enzyme, CHO cell lines were established to stably express polyoma large tumor (T) antigen, which enables transient expression cloning. Because the antibody used was found to detect most efficiently the oligosaccharide products attached to leukosialin, the CHO cells were also stably transfected with leukosialin cDNA. By using this particular CHO cell line, a cDNA that encodes a protein determining the formation of the core 2 structure was isolated from an HL-60 cDNA library. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein with type II membrane topology, as has been found for all other mammalian glycosyltransferases cloned to date. The expression of the presumed catalytic domain as a fusion protein with the IgG binding domain of protein A enabled us to demonstrate unequivocally that the cDNA encodes the core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for the formation of Gal beta 1-3(GlcNAc beta 1-6)GalNAc structures. No activity with this enzyme was detected toward the acceptors for other beta 1-6GlcNAc transferases.
A cDNA encoding a possible novel human 116-kDa polypeptide subunit of the osteoclastic proton pump (OC-116KDa) has been identified by differential screening of a human osteoclastoma cDNA library. The predicted sequence of OC-116kDa consists of 822 amino acids and is 46.9% and 47.2% identical at the amino acid level to the 116-KDa polypeptide of the vacuolar proton pump of rat and bovine brain respectively. OC-116KDa mRNA was found at high levels in osteoclastomas by Northern analysis but was not detected in tumor stromal cells or in other tissues including kidney, liver, skeletal muscle and brain. OC-116KDa mRNA was localized to multinucleated giant cells within the osteoclastoma tumor by in situ hybridization.
A cDNA encoding an ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit protein humEAA4 (GluR6), has been cloned from a human fetal brain library. This cDNA when expressed in COS or HEK-293 cells is associated with high-affinity kainate receptor binding and ion channel formation. We have successfully established cell lines stably expressing humEAA4 in HEK-293 cells This is the first report of the establishment of stable cell lines expressing a glutamate receptor channel. The relative potency of compounds for displacing [3H]-kainate binding to humEAA4 receptors expressed in COS or HEK-293 cells is domoate > kainate > quisqualate > 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione > L-glutamate = 6,7- dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione > dihydrokainate. Applications of kainate, glutamate, and domoate but not AMPA evoked rapidly desensitizing currents in cells expressing homo-oligomeric humEAA4 in a concentration dependent manner. The order of potency was: domoate > kainate > L-glutamate. Although AMPA did not itself activate humEAA4 receptors it did reduce, to a limited extent, kainate-evoked responses. AMPA may therefore be a weak partial agonist for this receptor. To date this effect has not been demonstrated with rat GluR6. It is possible that subtle species differences may exist in the nature of agonist receptor interaction. Kainate evoked currents were attenuated by the quinoxalinediones CNQX and DNQX but not by DAP5. The receptor desensitization was attenuated on application of concanavalin A. Ion-permeability studies indicated that the receptor-linked ion channel is permeable to both Na+ and Ca2+ ions.
A cDNA encoding human 60S ribosomal subunit protein L14 (hRL14) was isolated from a human immortal endothelial cell line, t-HUE4. This cell line was established via a series of cell lines cultured in a serum-free and a protein-free medium, and a directional cDNA library has been constructed and screened in search for the genes modulating protein synthesis machinery in cell proliferation. A putative full-length clone with an open reading frame of 220 amino acids; predicted molecular weight of 23.6 kDa. A significant identity for hRL14 was observed with rat RL14 (85% identity), with exception of COOH-terminal region, but not with any eukaryote amino acid sequences so far deposited to database. The typical features of ribosomal proteins were observed in hRL14, as seen in nuclear targeting sequences necessary for the transport from cytoplasm to nucleolus, a bZIP like (basic region-leucine zipper) element for the binding to rRNA, and the internal repeat sequences; the pentapeptide QKA(A/S)X. The COOH-terminal region of the transcripts contained fifteen triplet repeats (GCT; alanine) at nucleotide 465 to 509, which is significantly expanded compared to the rat RL14. However, the repeat number was all the same among the normal human endothelial cell line and the cell lines established in the course of t-HUE4 establishment. A single band with about 800 bases was identified by Northern blot analysis without tissue specificity. This GCT repeat was found to be one of the longest uninterrupted repeats in a coding sequence, which were associated with the highest degree of polymorphism.
A cDNA encoding human delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D; EC 4.2.1.24), the second enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, was isolated from a human liver cDNA expression library. Of the original 17 clones selected with anti-ALA-D antibody, only four expressed anti-ALA-D epitopes as assessed by rescreening with antibody preabsorbed with purified antigen. Subsequent screening of the antibody-positive clones with mixed oligodeoxynucleotide (oligo) probes, synthesized to correspond to human N-terminal and bovine active-site peptide sequences, identified three clones which hybridized only with the oligo probes for the bovine amino acid (aa) sequences. Restriction endonucleases analysis revealed that these three clones contained the same 800-bp cDNA insert. This insert was recloned into bacteriophage M13mp18 and mp19 and sequenced by primer extension. The aa sequence predicted from the partial nucleotide sequence was found to be essentially colinear with the sequences of four bovine ALA-D peptides, totaling 35 non-overlapping aa residues.
A cDNA encoding the 14-kDa subunit of vacuolar ATPase was cloned from human fetal brain. The sequence was composed of 680 nucleotides containing an open reading frame of 357 nucleotides. The deduced peptide sequence consisted of 119 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 13,369 Da and a pI of 5.19. Overall, this amino-acid sequence was respectively 69% and 70% identical to those of Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster 14-kDa subunits, although the two representatives of Class Insecta were remarkably similar to one another (91% identity). Three regions in particular (the N-terminal, amino acids 5-36; the middle, residues 58-68; and the C-terminal, residues 88-118) were highly conserved. Hence, we think that the 14-kDa subunits have evolved from the same ancestral gene, and that the three conserved regions are important for the structure and function of vacuolar ATPase. A single 0.8-kb band was detected in various human tissues by Northern blot analysis. Since the human 14-kDa subunit is expressed ubiquitously, it might be a housekeeping protein. A separate transcript found in the cDNA library lacked a 6-bp segment in the 5' non-coding region (nucleotides -40 to -35) and also carried a 23C to T (8Thr to Ile) point mutation in the coding region; these minor differences likely reflected normal polymorphism.
A cDNA for the human cytoplasmic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase (EC 4.1.3.5) was subcloned and expressed from a T7-based vector in Escherichia coli. The over-produced enzyme was purified using a three-step protocol that generated 20 to 30 mg protein/liter cell culture. The physical and catalytic properties of the recombinant synthase are similar to those reported for the nonrecombinant enzymes from chicken liver [Clinkenbeard et al. (1975a) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 3124-3135] and rat liver [Mehrabian et al. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16249-16255]. Mutation of Cys129 to serine or alanine destroys HMG-CoA synthase activity by disrupting the first catalytic step in HMG-CoA synthesis, enzyme acetylation by acetyl coenzyme A. Furthermore, unlike the wild-type enzyme, neither mutant was capable of covalent modification by the beta-lactone inhibitor, L-659,699 [Greenspan et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 7488-7492]. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition by L-659,699 revealed that this compound is a potent inhibitor of the recombinant human synthase, with an inhibition constant of 53.7 nM and an inactivation rate constant of 1.06 min-1.
A cDNA that encodes a novel Na+-independent neutral amino acid transporter was isolated from FLC4 human hepatocarcinoma cells by expression cloning. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the encoded protein designated LAT3 (L-type amino acid transporter 3) transported neutral amino acids such as l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine, and l-phenylalanine. The LAT3-mediated transport was Na+-independent and inhibited by 2-aminobicycloheptane-2-carboxylic acid, consistent with the properties of system L. Distinct from already known system L transporters LAT1 and LAT2, which form heterodimeric complex with 4F2 heavy chain, LAT3 was functional by itself in Xenopus oocytes. The deduced amino acid sequence of LAT3 was identical to the gene product of POV1 reported as a prostate cancer-up-regulated gene whose function was not determined, whereas it did not exhibit significant similarity to already identified transporters. The Eadie-Hofstee plots of LAT3-mediated transport were curvilinear, whereas the low affinity component is predominant at physiological plasma amino acid concentration. In addition to amino acid substrates, LAT3 recognized amino acid alcohols. The transport of l-leucine was electroneutral and mediated by a facilitated diffusion. In contrast, l-leucinol, l-valinol, and l-phenylalaninol, which have a net positive charge induced inward currents under voltage clamp, suggesting these compounds are transported by LAT3. LAT3-mediated transport was inhibited by the pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide, consistent with the property of system L2 originally characterized in hepatocyte primary culture. Based on the substrate selectivity, affinity, and N-ethylmaleimide sensitivity, LAT3 is proposed to be a transporter subserving system L2. LAT3 should denote a new family of organic solute transporters.
A calcineurin inhibitor combined with methotrexate is the standard prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Everolimus, a derivative of sirolimus, seems to mediate antileukemia effects. We report on a combination of everolimus and tacrolimus in 24 patients (median age, 62 years) with either myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 17) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 7) undergoing intensive conditioning followed by HSCT from related (n = 4) or unrelated (n = 20) donors. All patients engrafted, and only 1 patient experienced grade IV mucositis. Nine patients (37%) developed acute grade II-IV GVHD, and 11 of 17 evaluable patients (64%) developed chronic extensive GVHD. Transplantation-associated microangiopathy (TMA) occurred in 7 patients (29%), with 2 cases of acute renal failure. The study was terminated prematurely because an additional 6 patients (25%) developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), which was fatal in 2 cases. With a median follow-up of 26 months, the 2-year overall survival rate was 47%. Although this new combination appears to be effective as a prophylactic regimen for acute GVHD, the incidence of TMA and SOS is considerably higher than seen with other regimens.
A candidate DNA sequence with many of the properties predicted for the retinoblastoma susceptibility (RB1) locus has been cloned (S. H. Friend, R. Bernards, S. Rogelj, R. A. Weinberg, J. M. Rapaport, D. M. Albert, and T. P. Dryja, Nature [London] 323 643-645, 1986). The large size of this gene (ca. 200 kilobases [kb]) and its multiple dispersed exons (Wiggs et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 318 151-157, 1988) complicate molecular screening strategies important in prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis and in carrier detection. Here we used field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) to construct a restriction map of approximately 1, 000 kb of DNA surrounding the RB1 locus and to detect the translocation breakpoints in three retinoblastoma patients. DNA probes from either the 5 or 3 end of the gene were used to detect a 250-kb EagI restriction fragment in DNA from unaffected individuals. Both probes identified an additional hybridizing fragment in the DNA from each patient, permitting the breakpoints in all three to be mapped within the cloned RB1 gene. Analysis of the breakpoint in one translocation cell line allowed the RB1 gene to be oriented with its 5 end toward the centromere. The 5 end of the gene also appeared to be associated with a clustering of sites for several infrequently cleaving restriction enzymes, indicating the presence of an HpaII tiny fragment island. The detection and mapping of the translocation breakpoints of all three retinoblastoma patients to within the putative RB1 gene substantiated the authenticity of this candidate sequence and demonstrated the utility of FIGE in detecting chromosomal rearrangements affecting this locus.
A cap-binding protein complex mediating U snRNA export.
A case is presented of a reversible intra-Hisian block occurring under amiodarone treatment for atrial tachycardia in a patient without clear intraventricular conduction abnormalities. His bundle recordings showed an atrial tachycardia with intermittent exit block and greatly prolonged BH and HV intervals (40 and 100 msec, respectively). Thirty days after amiodarone discontinuation, His bundle electrograms showed atrial flutter without intra-Hisian or infra-Hisian delay. Amiodarone should be used with caution during long-term oral therapy in patients with or without clear intraventricular conduction defects.
A case is reported of the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in a woman taking oral contraceptives. She was treated with heparin, dipyridamole and hemodialysis; and after more than three months, her urinary output rose above 500 ml; and six months after the onset of anuria, dialysis treatment was stopped. This case emphasizes the possibility that HUS in adults is not invariably irreversible and that, despite prolonged oliguria, recovery of renal function can be obtained. Therefore, in adult patients affected by HUS, dialysis should not be discontinued prematurely; moreover, bilateral nephrectomy, for treatment of severe hypertension and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, should be performed with caution.
A case of a busulfan-induced hemorrhage cystitis is reported. Spontaneous resolution occurred following cessation of the drug. The similarity between the histologic appearances of busulfan cystitis and both radiation and cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis is discussed and the world literature reviewed. In view of the known tendency of busulfan to induce cellular atypia and carcinoma in other sites, periodic urinary cytology is suggested in patients on long-term therapy.
A case of acute hepatitis induced by zidovudine in a 38-year-old patient with AIDS is presented. The mechanism whereby the hepatitis was induced is not known. However, the patient tolerated well an alternative reverse transcriptase inhibitor, 2'3' dideoxyinosine. Physicians caring for patients with AIDS should be aware of this hitherto rarely reported complication.
A case of acute inflammatory myopathy associated with the use of pravastatin, a new hydrophilic 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaril coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is reported. The patient, a 69-year-old man was affected by non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He assumed pravastatin (20 mg/day) because of hypercholesterolemia. He was admitted with acute myopathy of the lower limbs which resolved in a few days after pravastatin discontinuation. A previously unknown hypothyroidism, probably due to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, was evidenced. Muscle biopsy (left gastrocnemius) revealed a perimysial and endomysial inflammatory infiltrate with a prevalence of CD4+ lymphocytes. While lovastatin and simvastatin have been associated with toxic myopathy, pravastatin-associated myopathy could represent a distinct, inflammatory entity.
A case of acute renal failure, due to occlusion of renal vessels in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and tranexamic acid has been described recently. We report a case of acute renal failure in an APL patient treated with ATRA alone. This case further supports the concern about thromboembolic complications associated with ATRA therapy in APL patients. The patients, a 43-year-old man, presented all the signs and symptoms of APL and was included in a treatment protocol with ATRA. After 10 days of treatment, he developed acute renal failure that was completely reversible after complete remission of APL was achieved and therapy discontinued. We conclude that ATRA is a valid therapeutic choice for patients with APL, although the procoagulant tendency is not completely corrected. Thrombotic events, however, could be avoided by using low-dose heparin.
A case of bilateral optic neuropathy in a patient on tacrolimus (FK506) therapy after liver transplantation.
A case of branch retinal vein occlusion associated with fluoxetine-induced secondary hypertension is described. Although an infrequent complication of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy, it is important that ophthalmologists are aware that these agents can cause hypertension because this class of drugs is widely prescribed.
A case of fatal aplastic anemia due to carbamazepine treatment in an epileptic woman is reported. Despite concerns of fatal bone marrow toxicity due to carbamazepine, this is only the fourth documented and published report. Carbamazepine is a safe drug, but physicians and patients should be aware of the exceedingly rare but potentially fatal side effects, better prevented by clinical than by laboratory monitoring.
A case of genuine stress incontinence due to prazosin, a common antihypertensive drug, is presented. Prazosin exerts its antihypertensive effects through vasodilatation caused by selective blockade of postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. As an alpha-blocker, it also exerts a significant relaxant effect on the bladder neck and urethra. The patient's clinical course is described and correlated with initial urodynamic studies while on prazosin and subsequent studies while taking verapamil. Her incontinence resolved with the change of medication. The restoration of continence was accompanied by a substantial rise in maximum urethral pressure, maximum urethral closure pressure, and functional urethral length. Patients who present with stress incontinence while taking prazosin should change their antihypertensive medication before considering surgery, because their incontinence may resolve spontaneously with a change in drug therapy.
A case of human complete C6 deficiency is reported. The patient, a 31 year old white male, was seen on the occasion of an isolated episode of meningococcal meningitis. Serum complement hemolytic and bactericidal activities were lacking and could be restored to normal by addition of appropriate amounts of purified C6. No hemostatic abnormalities were observed..
A case of intercerebral hematoma due to warfarin-induced coagulopathy is presented. The 39-year-old woman had spread a warfarin-type rat poison around her house weekly using her bare hands, with no washing post application. Percutaneous absorption of warfarin causing coagulopathy, reported three times in the past, is a significant risk if protective measures, such as gloves, are not used. An adverse drug interaction with piroxicam, which she took occasionally, may have exacerbated the coagulopathy.
A case of isotretinoin embryopathy with bilateral anotia and Taussig-Bing malformation.
A case of lithium-induced diabetes insipidus is reported. At necropsy microscopy shoed unique and extensive damage to cells lining the distal nephron. It is suggested that these changes represent a specific toxic effect of lithium, reported here for the first time in man.
A case of massive rhabdomyolysis following molindone administration.
A case of metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure and hepatic failure following paracetamol ingestion is presented. The diagnostic difficulty at presentation is highlighted. Continuous arteriovenous haemofiltration proved a valuable means of maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance. The patient recovered.
A case of necrotizing myopathy due to a short epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) treatment in a 72 year-old patient with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is described. Pathogenetic hypotheses are discussed.
A case of nontraumatic dissecting aneurysm of the basilar artery in association with hypertension, smoke, and oral contraceptives is reported in a young female patient with a locked-in syndrome.
A case of oral penicillin anaphylaxis is described, and the terminology, occurrence, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of anaphylaxis are reviewed. Emergency physicians should be aware of oral penicillin anaphylaxis in order to prevent its occurrence by prescribing the antibiotic judiciously and knowledgeably and to offer optimal medical therapy once this life-threatening reaction has begun.
A case of phenytoin (DPH) encephalopathy with increasing seizures and EEG and mental changes is described. Despite adequate oral dosage of DPH (5 mg/kg/daily) the plasma level was very low (2.8 microgramg/ml). The encephalopathy was probably an idiosyncratic and not toxic or allergic reaction. In fact the concentration of free DPH was normal, the patient presented a retarded morbilliform rash during DPH treatment, the protidogram was normal, and an intradermic DPH injection had no local effect. The authors conclude that in a patient starting DPH treatment an unexpected increase in seizures, with EEG and mental changes occurring simultaneously, should alert the physician to the possible need for eliminating DPH from the therapeutic regimen, even if plasma concentrations are low.

A case of recurarization in the recovery room is reported. Accumulation of atracurium in the intravenous line led to recurarization after flushing the line in the recovery room. A respiratory arrest with severe desaturation and bradycardia occurred. Circumstances leading to this event and the mechanisms enabling a neuromuscular blockade to occur, following the administration of a small dose of relaxant, are discussed.
A case of tardive dyskinesia caused by metoclopramide.
A case of thoracic hematomyelia secondary to anticoagulant therapy is presented. Clinical features, similar to 2 other previously reported cases, are discussed. A high index of suspicion may lead to a quick diagnostic procedure and successful decompressive surgery.
A case of thoraco-abdominal rigidity leading to respiratory failure is described in the post-operative period in an elderly patient who received a moderate dose of fentanyl. This was successfully reversed by naloxone. The mechanisms possibly implicated in this accident are discussed.
A case of triamterene nephrolithiasis is reported in a man after 4 years of hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene therapy for hypertension. The stone passed spontaneously and was found to contain a triamterene metabolite admixed with uric acid salts. Factors affecting triamterene nephrolithiasis are discussed and 2 previously reported cases are reviewed.
A case of veno-occlusive disease of the liver with fatal outcome after dacarbazine (DTIC) therapy for melanoma is reported. There was a fulminant clinical course from start of symptoms until death. At autopsy the liver was enlarged and firm with signs of venous congestion. Small- and medium-sized hepatic veins were blocked by thrombosis. Eosinophilic infiltrations were found around the vessels. Published cases from the literature are reviewed and pertinent features discussed.

A chromosome 15 anomaly was observed in 12 of 20 patients, 17 of whom were clinically suspected of having Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The clinical features of eight cases with 15q11-12 deletion were very similar to those originally described in PWS. On the other hand, the group of normal karyotype patients is heterogeneous, and their features do not strictly correspond to the clinical definition of PWS. However, the hypothesis that PWS is associated with deletion of 15q11-12 can neither explain the apparently balanced translocations of chromosome 15 nor account for the small supernumerary metacentric chromosomes corresponding to an isochromosome 15 for band 15q11 observed in some cases..
A chronic schizophrenic patient was treated with an anticholinergic drug, trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride. The patient developed, paradoxically, sinus bradycardia. The reaction was specific to trihexyphenidyl and not to other anticholinergic drugs. This antidyskinetic drug is widely used in clinical psychiatric practice and physicians should be aware of this side effect.
A clinical evaluation of etomidate for outpatient cystoscopy was embarked upon. Unpremedicated patients were given fentanyl 1 microgram/kg followed by etomidate 0.3 mg/kg. Anaesthesia was maintained with intermittent etomidate in 2-4 mg doses. Patients were interviewed personally later the same day, and by questionnaire three to four weeks later. The trial was discontinued after 20 cases because of an unacceptable incidence of side effects. Venous pain occurred in 68% of patients and 50% had redness, pain or swelling related to the injection site, in some cases lasting up to three weeks after anaesthesia. Skeletal movements occurred in 50% of patients; 30% experienced respiratory upset, one sufficiently severe to necessitate abandoning the technique. Nausea and vomiting occurred in 40% and 25% had disturbing emergence psychoses.
A clinical overview of WT1 gene mutations.
A clinical presentation is made of a 2-3 year follow-up of six cases of acute renal failure that have been reported earlier. The patients had developed transient renal failure after the intermittent administration of rifampicin. The stage of olig-anuria lasted for 1-3 weeks, and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis. Two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow-up period. The four patients re-examined were clinically cured. Pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce. Nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied. Renal function was normal. In three cases the excretion at 131I-hippuran renography was slightly slowed. Although in the acute stage the renal lesions histologically appeared toxic, evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism cannot be excluded.
A clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the recommended dose of cyclophosphamide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone as induction treatment before stem cell transplantation for younger patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). Thirty patients were treated with three 21-day cycles of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 plus dexamethasone 40 mg on the day of bortezomib injection and the day after plus cyclophosphamide at 900, 1,200, or 1,500 mg/m(2) on day 1. The maximum tolerated dose of cyclophosphamide was defined as 900 mg/m(2). At this dose level, 92% of patients achieved at least a partial response. The overall response rate [complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR)] across all dose levels was 77%, with a 10% CR rate. No patient experienced progressive disease. The most frequent adverse events were hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities as well as neuropathy. The results suggest that bortezomib in combination with cyclophosphamide at 900 mg/m(2) and dexamethasone is an effective induction treatment for patients with newly diagnosed MM that warrants further investigation.
A combination of 5 d of nelarabine (AraG) with 5 d of etoposide (VP) and cyclophosphamide (CPM) and prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was used as salvage therapy in seven children with refractory or relapsed T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma. The most common side effects attributable to the AraG included Grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor neuropathy and musculoskeletal pain. Haematological toxicity was greater for the combination than AraG alone, although median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was consistent with other salvage therapies. All patients had some response to the combined therapy and five of the seven went into complete remission after one or two courses of AraG/VP/CPM. Our experience supports the safety of giving AraG as salvage therapy in synchrony with etoposide and cyclophosphamide, although neurological toxicity must be closely monitored.
A combination of multiplex PCR with the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique was employed to screen for point mutations in the human dystrophin gene. Co-amplification of 11 exons from genomic DNA of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) patients with no deletion or duplication was performed and the samples subjected to multiple SSCP analysis. We report the case of a nonsense mutation in a Duchenne patient identified by this approach. The mutation introduces a termination codon within exon 8 of the dystrophin gene. It is predicted to cause a very premature translational termination accounting for the severe phenotype observed. The patient inherited this mutation from his mother. In addition the analysis revealed 5 polymorphisms useful for internal control..
A common MSH2 mutation in English and North American HNPCC families: origin, phenotypic expression, and sex specific differences in colorectal cancer.
A common genetic variant (V) of the human luteinizing hormone (LH) beta-subunit gene was recently discovered. The V-LH molecules have higher bioactivity in vitro, but shorter half-life in circulation, which apparently is related to the alterations of LH function observed in individuals homo- and heterozygous for the V-LHbeta allele. We have now studied whether additional mutations in the V-LHbeta promoter sequence could contribute to the altered physiology of the LH variant molecules. The 661 bp 5'-flanking region of the V-LHbeta gene, retrieved from human genomic DNA by PCR, contained eight single-nucleotide changes, as compared with the wild-type (wt) LHbeta promoter. The finding was consistent in DNA samples of different ethnic groups. Reporter constructs with various lengths of the wt- and V-LH promoter sequences, driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene, were transfected into an immortalized mouse pituitary cell line, LbetaT(2), known to express the endogenous LHbeta gene, and into a non-endocrine human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK 293. Basal expression levels of the V-LHbeta promoter constructs were on average 36% higher in LbetaT(2)cells ( P < 0.001; n = 29), and 40% higher in HEK 293 cells ( P < 0.001; n = 16), as compared with the respective wt sequences. Numerous qualitative and quantitative differences were found between the two cell lines in responses of the two promoter sequences to stimulation with 12- O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, forskolin, 8-bromo-cAMP, progesterone and gonado- tropin-releasing hormone. In conclusion, the V-LHbeta promoter has higher basal activity, and differs in response to hormonal stimulation, as compared with the wt-LHbeta promoter. The altered promoter function of the V-LHbeta gene provides evidence for differences in regulation of the wt- and V-LHbeta genes, which may contribute to the differences observed in pituitary-gonadal function between carriers of the two LHbeta alleles. The findings also suggest a novel evolutionary mechanism whereby polymorphic changes resulting in altered bioactivity of a gene product may be compensated for by additional mutations in the cognate promoter sequence, changing transcription of the same gene.

A common side effect associated with succinylcholine is postoperative myalgia. The pathogenesis of this myalgia is still unclear; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence. We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this myalgia. The incidence and severity of succinylcholine-associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before succinylcholine (n = 32 for each). Incidence and severity of myalgia did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of myalgia compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe myalgia was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively (not significant). At 48 h after surgery, 12 patients in both groups still suffered from myalgia (not significant). In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) as an early marker of inflammation was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline. We found an increase of IL-6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported myalgia; no relationship between myalgia and the increase of IL-6 was found. In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of succinylcholine-associated myalgia. IMPLICATIONS: Administration of dexamethasone before succinylcholine was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of succinylcholine-induced postoperative myalgia. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between postoperative myalgia and time course of interleukin-6 concentrations, a marker of inflammation. Pretreatment with dexamethasone is not justified to prevent postoperative myalgia after succinylcholine.

A controlled, double-blind therapeutic trial with the drug mazindol, a growth hormone inhibitor, was performed in a pair of 7 1/2 year-old monozygotic twins, with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The rationale for this trial was based on a patient (reported previously) affected simultaneously with DMD and growth hormone (GH) deficiency, who is showing a benign course of the dystrophic process and is still walking at 18 years. One of the twins received 2 mg of mazindol daily, while the other received a placebo. The assessment, repeated every 2 months, included weight and height measurements, functional and motor ability tests, ergometry and determinations of serum enzymes and GH levels. After one year of trial the code was broken and it was seen that the twin under placebo treatment was strikingly worse than his brother, the progression of whose condition was practically arrested. These results strongly suggest that treatment with a GH inhibitor is beneficial for DMD patients..
A controversy has existed for several years concerning the physiological relevance of the nicotinic receptor measured by alpha-bungarotoxin binding. Using mice derived from a classical F2 and backcross genetic design, a relationship between nicotine-induced seizures and alpha-bungarotoxin nicotinic receptor concentration was found. Mice sensitive to the convulsant effects of nicotine had greater alpha-bungarotoxin binding in the hippocampus than seizure insensitive mice. The binding sites from seizure sensitive and resistant mice were equally affected by treatment with dithiothreitol, trypsin or heat. Thus it appears that the difference between seizure sensitive and insensitive animals may be due to a difference in hippocampal nicotinic receptor concentration as measured with alpha-bungarotoxin binding.

A defect in the E1 beta subunit of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex is one cause of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). In an attempt to elucidate the molecular basis of MSUD, we isolated and characterized a 1.35 kbp cDNA clone encoding the entire precursor of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH complex from a human placental cDNA library. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the isolated cDNA clone (lambda hBE1 beta-1) contained a 5'-untranslated sequence of four nucleotides, the translated sequence of 1,176 nucleotides and the 3'-untranslated sequence of 169 nucleotides. Comparison of the amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA insert of the clone with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified mature bovine BCKDH-E1 beta subunit showed that the cDNA insert encodes for a 342-amino acid subunit with a Mr = 37,585. The subunit is synthesized as the precursor with a leader sequence of 50 amino acids and is processed at the NH2 terminus. A search for protein homology revealed that the primary structure of human BCKDH-E1 beta was similar to the bovine BCKDH-E1 beta and to the E1 beta subunit of human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, in all regions. The structures and functions of mammalian alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes are apparently highly conserved. Genomic DNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from normal and five MSUD patients, in whom E1 beta was not detected by immunoblot analysis, gave the same restriction maps on Southern blot analysis. The gene has at least 80 kbp.
A deficient L-arginine-nitric oxide system is implicated in cortisol-induced hypertension. We investigate whether abnormalities in L-arginine uptake contribute to this deficiency. Eight healthy men were recruited. Hydrocortisone acetate (50 mg) was given orally every 6 hours for 24 hours after a 5-day fixed-salt diet (150 mmol/d). Crossover studies were performed 2 weeks apart. Thirty milliliters of blood was obtained for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells after each treatment period. L-arginine uptake was assessed in mononuclear cells incubated with L-arginine (1 to 300 micromol/L), incorporating 100 nmol/L [3H]-l-arginine for a period of 5 minutes at 37 degrees C. Forearm [3H]-L-arginine extraction was calculated after infusion of [3H]-L-arginine into the brachial artery at a rate of 100 nCi/min for 80 minutes. Deep forearm venous samples were collected for determination of L-arginine extraction. Plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly raised during the active phase (323+/-43 to 1082+/-245 mmol/L, P<0.05). Systolic blood pressure was elevated by an average of 7 mm Hg. Neither L-arginine transport into mononuclear cells (placebo vs active, 26.3+/-3.6 vs 29.0+/-2.1 pmol/10 000 cells per 5 minutes, respectively, at an l-arginine concentration of 300 micromol/L) nor L-arginine extraction in the forearm (at 80 minutes, placebo vs active, 1 868 904+/-434 962 vs 2 013 910+/-770 619 disintegrations per minute) was affected by cortisol treatment; ie, that L-arginine uptake is not affected by short-term cortisol treatment. We conclude that cortisol-induced increases in blood pressure are not associated with abnormalities in the l-arginine transport system.

A detailed multipoint map of human chromosome 4 provides evidence for linkage heterogeneity and position-specific recombination rates.
A detailed transcription map of the 320-kb region containing the HSD17B locus on chromosome 17 was generated. Thirty unique cDNA fragments, retrieved following the hybridization of immobilized YACs to primary pools of cDNAs prepared from RNA of mammary gland, ovary, placenta, and the Caco-2 cell line, were aligned into 10 transcription units by physical mapping and hybridization to RNAs of a series of tissues. The cDNAs were then further characterized by sequencing and used to screen mammary gland cDNA libraries. Fragments corresponding to the broadly expressed gamma-tubulin and Ki antigen genes were identified. A full-length cDNA clone encoding a 117-amino-acid protein homologous to the rat ribosomal protein L34 was isolated. Portions of genes with restricted patterns of expression were also obtained, including the previously characterized HSD17B1. One new gene, for which a full-length cDNA was isolated, was found to have an interesting tissue-specific pattern of expression with abundant mRNA in both the colon and the testis and in the mammary carcinoma cell line BT-474. This contrasted with the barely detectable level observed in several tissues including normal mammary gland. Of the five additional transcription units identified, one showed no similarity, two showed identity to human expressed sequences, and two displayed similarity to genes of animal species by amino acid alignment. These latter cDNA clones include potential homologues of a rat nuclear tyrosine phosphatase and of a factor of Drosophila that is known to be involved in the negative regulation of transcription of segment identity genes.
A developmental analysis of clonidine's effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production in infant rats.
A diagnosis of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (MIM 312080) was made in a young boy. No mutation in the coding region of the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene had been found. The boys maternal aunt came for prenatal diagnosis when 16 + weeks pregnant and carrying a male fetus. Samples were tested for duplication of the PLP gene, by interphase FISH, in lymphocyte preparations from the proband, his aunt and an amniotic fluid cell preparation from the fetus. The proband was found to carry the duplication, thus confirming the diagnosis of Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease, but neither the aunt nor the fetus carried a duplication..

A family in which two male siblings were affected with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) was studied using G-6-PD isoenzymes as an X-linked marker in order to investigate the nature of cellular abnormalities. Isolated peripheral blood cell types from the doubly heterozygous mother of the affected males seemingly failed to express the G-6-PD allele in cis position with the WAS allele while her cultured skin fibroblasts expressed both G-6-PD alleles. Additionally, a histogram analysis of platelet size revealed a single population of abnormally small platelets in the affected propositus, whereas the heterozygous mother had no appreciable small platelet subpopulation. In vitro culture of hemopoietic progenitor cells of the heterozygous mother showed that the majority of progenitor cells did not express the WAS allele. However, a small number of cells expressing the G-6-PD type linked with the WAS allele were detected. The proportion of the latter progenitors was significantly higher among more primitive progenitors (those giving rise to later appearing colonies). This observation suggests that selection against cells expressing the Wiskott-Aldrich defect takes place in the hemopoietic system of the heterozygous female and offers a possible means of carrier detection in some women. Linkage studies in this family revealed one example of probable recombination between the loci for WAS and G-6-PD among three informative subjects, suggesting that these two loci may not be closely linked on the X-chromosome..
A family is described in which three children had homozygous deficiency of C3 and in which both parents and two other children were heterozygous for the C3 null gene. One child with heterozygous C3 deficiency was found to have membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; proteinuria and/or microscopical haematuria was present in all three homozygous C3-deficient children. All children with homozygous or heterozygous C3 deficiency were, to a varying degree, susceptible to infection. The only child of the family with normal complement had no increased risk of infection and no renal disease. This family study provides further support for the proposal that C3 deficiency predisposes to nephritis..
A family of G-protein-coupled chemoattractant receptors is known to mediate the transport and activation of neutrophils and macrophages This family includes receptors for chemokines, such as interleukin-8, bacterial formylated peptides, platelet-activating factor, leukotriene B4, and the complement anaphylatoxins. The apparent redundancy of these receptors suggests that they have an important underlying role in host defence. To isolate the contribution of particular molecules, we disrupted a gene that encodes a single chemoattractant receptor. Here we show that mice deficient in the chemoattractant C5a receptor, in comparison to their wild-type littermates, were unable to clear intrapulmonary-instilled Pseudomonas aeruginosa, despite a marked increase in neutrophil influx, and succumbed to pneumonia. These C5a-receptor-deficient mice challenged with sublethal inocula of Pseudomonas become superinfected with secondary bacterial strains. We conclude that the C5a receptor has a non-redundant function, and is required for mucosal host defence in the lung.
A family of domestic cats was found that exhibited clinical and biochemical abnormalities consistent with mucopolysaccharidosis VII, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by beta-glucuronidase deficiency. beta-Glucuronidase activity was undetectable in affected cat fibroblasts and restored by retroviral gene transfer of rat beta-glucuronidase cDNA. beta-Glucuronidase mRNA was normal in affected cat testis by Northern blot analysis. Normal feline beta-glucuronidase cDNA was cloned and characterized, and amplified from affected cat fibroblasts by reverse transcription coupled polymerase chain reaction. There was a G-to-A transition in the affected cat cDNA that predicted an E351K substitution, destroyed a BssSI site, and eliminated GUSB enzymatic activity in expression studies. Multiple species comparison and the crystal structure of human beta-glucuronidase indicated that E351 is a highly conserved residue most likely essential in maintenance of the enzymes conformation. BssSI digestion of polymerase chain reaction products amplified from genomic DNA indicated that affected cats were homozygous and cats with half-normal beta-glucuronidase activity were heterozygous for the missense mutation. Carriers identified in this manner produced affected kittens in prospective breedings, and a feline MPS VII breeding colony has been established..

A family with an apparent history of X-linked Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease presented for genetic counseling, requesting carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis. RFLP analysis using the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene probe was uninformative in this family. A prenatal diagnosis on a chorionic villus sample (CVS) was carried out using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of a variant in exon 4 of the PLP gene. The fetus was predicted to be unaffected. Sequencing of the exon from the CVS, the predicted-carrier mother, and the obligate-carrier grandmother revealed an A-to-C change at nucleotide 541 in the two women but not in the fetus. As this change results in a Thr-to-Pro change at amino acid 181 in a region of the gene predicted to be part of a transmembrane segment, it was concluded that this was the mutation causing the disease in this family. In addition, in a second family, an exon 5 variant band pattern on SSCP analysis was shown by sequencing to be due to a T-to-C change at nucleotide 668. This results in a Leu-to-Pro change in a carrier mother and in her two affected sons. These results provide further examples of mutations in PLP that cause Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease and illustrate the value of SSCP in genetic analysis..
A family with two consecutive nonsense mutations in BMPR1A causing juvenile polyposis.
A father and daughter with isolated aniridia were observed to have an apparently balanced, reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 5 and 11 [t (5; 11) (q13. 1; p13)]. No other clinical characteristics often associated with the deletion of 11p13 were observed in this family. This finding, in association with 3 other instances of single breaks at 11p13 and aniridia, supports the assignment of AN2 to 11p13.
A forty-six year-old premenopausal woman developed headache, nausea and vomiting, left hemiparesis and seizure two days after parenteral use of progesterone and estradiol. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was found during admission. Computed tomography showed a hemorrhagic infarct in the right frontal lobe and increased density in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). Left carotid angiography found occlusion of the left internal carotid artery (ICA). Right carotid angiograms failed to show the SSS and inferior sagittal sinus, suggestive of venous sinus thrombosis. Coexistence of the cerebral artery and the venous sinus occlusion has been described infrequently. In this case, the authors postulate that the use of estradiol and progesterone and the underlying DM increased vascular thrombogenicity, which provided a common denominator for thrombosis of both the ICA and the venous sinus.
A fragment of the cDNA encoding a rat valyl-tRNA synthetase (TrsVal)-like protein was cloned from a rat cDNA library in lambda gt11 using an oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) probe. Three independent plaque clones containing the human TrsVal cDNA were then isolated from a lambda gt10 human erythroleukemia cDNA library using the rat cDNA fragment as the hybridization probe. Sequence analyses of the cDNA fragments provided a 3.2-kb sequence with an open reading frame that contained the 'HIGH' synthetase signature sequence and the tRNA 3'-end-binding motif, KMSKS, and putative Val-binding motif, EWCISRQ. The sequence was extended to the 3' end of the cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction using an internal primer and an oligo(dT) adapter. The deduced 1051-amino-acid sequence shares 65% identity with yeast TrsVal, and contains a highly basic N-terminal region, a newly evolved protease-sensitive region in sequence close to the C terminus, and several sites for protein kinase C phosphorylation. A 3-kb cDNA fragment was sub-cloned into plasmid pSVL and expressed in COS-7 cells; up to a sevenfold increase in TrsVal activity was obtained. These results confirm the cloning and sequencing of a human TrsVal-encoding cDNA.
A full-length 1966-base pair clone of the human class IV alcohol dehydrogenase (sigma-ADH) was isolated from a human stomach cDNA library. The 373-amino acid sigma-ADH encoded by this cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The specific activity of the recombinant enzyme for ethanol oxidation at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C, calculated from active-site titration of NADH binding, was 92 +/- 9 units/mg. Kinetic analysis of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of recombinant sigma-ADH for oxidation of primary alcohols indicated broad substrate specificity. Recombinant human sigma-ADH exhibited high catalytic efficiency for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. This pathway is important in the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator all-trans-retinoic acid. Secondary alcohols and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids were inactive with sigma-ADH or were oxidized with very low efficiency. The KM of sigma-ADH for ethanol was 25 mM, and the KM for primary straight chain alcohols decreased substantially as chain length increased. There are important amino acid differences in the alcohol-binding site between the human class IV (sigma) and human class I (beta) alcohol dehydrogenases that appear to explain the high catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinol, the high kcat for ethanol, and the low catalytic efficiency for secondary alcohols of sigma-ADH relative to beta 1-ADH. For example, modeling the binding of all-trans-retinol in the human beta 1-ADH structure suggested that coordination of retinol to the active-site zinc is hindered by a loop from residues 114 to 120 that is at the entrance to the alcohol-binding site. The deletion of Gly-117 in human sigma-ADH and a substitution of Leu for the bulky Tyr-110 appear to facilitate retinol access to the active-site zinc.
A full-length cDNA encoding 15-lipoxygenase has been isolated from a human reticulocyte cDNA library. The predicted primary structure of the enzyme exhibits a sequence similarity of 61% and 45% with human 5-lipoxygenase and the soybean lipoxygenase isoenzyme I, respectively. When all three lipoxygenases are aligned, there are two distinct regions of significant sequence identity including a cluster of five histidine residues conserved in all three lipoxygenases. Because histidines can serve as ligands for the enzymatically active iron, this region may be critical to enzymatic function. These results provide a basis for exploring functional domains of lipoxygenases.
A full-length cDNA homologous to RAB7, a member of the RAB-related GTP-binding protein subfamily, was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library. This cDNA, designated RAB7L1, has an open reading frame of 609 nucleotides encoding 203 amino acids. Northern analysis showed that the mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, although signal intensities were different among the various organs examined. This gene was located on chromosome band 1q32 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
A gene encoding a novel transmembrane protein was identified by DNA sequence analysis within the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) locus IDDM4 on chromosome 11q13. Based on its chromosomal position, this gene is a candidate for conferring susceptibility to diabetes. The gene, termed low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5 (LRP5), encodes a protein of 1615 amino acids that contains conserved modules which are characteristic of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. These modules include a putative signal peptide for protein export, four epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats with associated spacer domains, three LDL-receptor (LDLR) repeats, a single transmembrane spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The encoded protein has a unique organization of EGF and LDLR repeats; therefore, LRP5 likely represents a new category of the LDLR family. Both human and mouse LRP5 cDNAs have been isolated and the encoded mature proteins are 95% identical, indicating a high degree of evolutionary conservation..
A gene encoding a putative human RNA helicase, p54, has been cloned and mapped to the band q23.3 of chromosome 11. The predicted amino acid sequence shares a striking homology (75% identical) with the female germline-specific RNA helicase ME31B gene of Drosophila. Unlike ME31B, however, the new gene expresses an abundant transcript in a large number of adult tissues and its 5' non-coding region was found split in a t(11;14)(q23.3;q32.3) cell line from a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
A gene encoding a transmembrane protein is mutated in patients with diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy (Wolfram syndrome).
A gene for a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) was isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library by PCR amplification. Sequence analysis revealed that the PTPase has a single phosphatase catalytic domain located at the C-terminus that includes the highly conserved amino acid domain [I/V]HCXAGXXR[S/T]GX[F/Y] found in all tyrosine phosphatases. Two proline-rich regions located at the N-terminus may contain putative Src homology domain 3 (SH3) binding motifs. Comparison of the PTPase with a previously cloned striatum enriched phosphatase (STEP) from rat and from mouse exhibited a high degree of identity (approximately 85-90%) at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels, indicating that the human PTPase is the homolog of the rat and murine STEP gene. By using a combination of somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have mapped the human STEP locus to chromosome 11p15.2-p15.1 and the murine STEP gene to chromosome 7B3-B5. These are two regions of known conserved synteny, providing further evidence that the human STEP is a true homolog of the murine STEP gene. Candidate disease genes in the vicinity include Usher syndrome type 1C in human and a mouse mutant locus, twister (twt).
A gene mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), ATM, was recently identified by positional cloning. ATM is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase superfamily, some of which are protein kinases and appear to have important roles in cell cycle control and radiation signal transduction. We describe herein, to our knowledge, for the first time, the cloning of a full-length cDNA for ATM and correction of multiple aspects of the radio-sensitive phenotype of A-T cells by transfection with this cDNA. Overexpression of ATM cDNA in A-T cells enhanced the survival of these cells in response to radiation exposure, decreased radiation-induced chromosome aberrations, reduced radio-resistant DNA synthesis, and partially corrected defective cell cycle checkpoints and induction of stress-activated protein kinase. This correction of the defects in A-T cells provides further evidence of the multiplicity of effector functions of the ATM protein and suggests possible approaches to gene therapy..
A genetic deficiency of the fifth (C5) component of complement1-3, a serum glycoprotein of molecular weight (MW) 220, 000 (ref. 4), has been found in 39% of inbred strains of mice3. Sera of deficient mice lack detectable C5 activity and protein2, 3. In addition deficient mice produce antibody to mouse C5 when injected with sera from C5 sufficient (normal) strains. Levy et al. 5 showed that somatic cell hybrids between C5 deficient (B10. D2/old line) macrophages and either C5 sufficient (B10. D2/new line) mouse kidney or chicken erythroblasts secreted haemolytically active mouse C5 in vitro. Several possible molecular mechanisms to account for the findings were considered, but insufficient direct data were available to choose among them. We recently reported that mouse (CD. 1 strain) peritoneal cells in culture synthesise and secrete a single chain precursor, pro-C5 (MW approximately 210, 000), of the two-chain (alpha chain, 125, 000 and beta chain 83, 000 MW) C5 protein6. Radiolabelled precursor C5 was contained within the cells and was secreted into the tissue culture media. Using similar methods, we now find that C5 deficiency in each of five different mouse strains (AKR, SWR, DBA/2J8 A/HeJ and B10. D2/old line) is due to a failure in secretion of C5 protein and not to a failure in biosynthesis of pro-C5
A genetic etiology for DiGeorge syndrome: consistent deletions and microdeletions of 22q11.
A genetic linkage map of six polymorphic DNA markers close to the gene (APC) for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) on chromosome 5q is reported. One hundred fifty-five typed members of nine FAP kindred provided more than 90 meioses for linkage analysis. A number of crucial recombination events have been identified which are informative at three or more loci, allowing confident ordering of parts of the map. There was no evidence of genetic heterogeneity, with all families showing linkage of at least one chromosome 5 marker to the gene. Recombination data and two-point linkage analysis support a locus order of centromere-pi 227-C11P11-ECB27-L5. 62-APC-EF5 62-APC-EF5. 44-YN5 44-YN5. 48-telomer e, although EF5. 44 could lie in the interval L5. 62-APC or ECB27-L5. 62. No recombinants were identified between APC and either EF5. 44 or YN5. 48, but published deletion mapping in colorectal carcinomas and linkage analysis in FAP suggest that YN5. 48 is 1-3 cM from APC. The present study suggests that YN5. 48 and L5. 62 delineate a small region of chromosome 5 within which the EF5. 44 locus lies very close to the APC gene. These data not only allow use of flanking markers for presymptomatic diagnosis of FAP but also provide a high-density map of the region for isolation of the APC gene itself and for further assessment of the role of chromosome 5 deletions in the biology of sporadic colorectal cancer.

A group of doctors in Boston warn that the protease inhibitor Viracept may cause an irregular heart beat, known as bradycardia, in people with HIV. Bradycardia occurred in a 45-year-old male patient who was Viracept in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. The symptoms ceased after switching to another drug combination.
A group of four monkeys was rendered parkinsonian with the toxin MPTP. They were then treated chronically with L-DOPA/benserazide 50/12.5 mg/kg given orally daily for 2 months. This dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect, but all animals manifested dyskinesia. A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with L-DOPA to see if the dyskinetic movements would be modified. Several drugs, including clonidine, physostigmine, methysergide, 5-MDOT, propranolol, and MK-801, markedly reduced the dyskinetic movements but at the cost of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology. However, yohimbine and meperidine reduced predominantly the dyskinetic movements. Baclofen was also useful in one monkey against a more dystonic form of dyskinesia. Atropine converted the dystonic movements into chorea.
A group of novel human Ran-binding proteins, RanBP3, was identified using the yeast two-hybrid system via Ran-mediated interaction with the nucleotide exchange factor RCC1. Several open reading frames, representing putative alternatively spliced products, were established by cDNA cloning. Two of them, RanBP3-a and RanBP3-b, encode nuclear hydrophilic proteins of 499 and 562 amino acid residues. The sequences contain FXFG motifs, characteristic of a subgroup of nucleoporins, and a C-terminal domain showing similarity to the Ran-binding protein RanBP1. These proteins are localized in the nucleus, preferentially bind RanGTP and may be nuclear effectors of the Ran pathway.
A group of patients with long-surviving mismatched kidney allografts were investigated for complement function using haemolytic assays in agarose gels. One patient was found to have no alternative pathway activity but a low normal classical pathway. Surprisingly, investigation revealed that the patients complement was normal for all components except C9, which was functionally absent. The patient was shown to be heterozygous for DNA markers in the C6, C7 and C9 region of chromosome 5 and therefore appears to be a compound heterozygote for two uncharacterized C9 deficiency genes. Serological analysis by ELISA revealed that he has trace concentrations of a non-functional C9 molecule. Western blot analysis was not sufficiently sensitive to permit detection of this molecule. We hypothesize that the patient is heterozygous for a complete deficiency of C9 and for a gene directing hyposynthesis of a defective C9. We also suggest that C9 deficiency may be more common among Caucasians than has been reported..
A healthy 17-year-old male received standard intermittent doses of pethidine via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump for management of postoperative pain control. Twenty-three h postoperatively he developed a brief self-limited seizure. Both plasma pethidine and norpethidine were elevated in the range associated with clinical manifestations of central nervous system excitation. No other risk factors for CNS toxicity were identified. This method allowed frequent self-dosing of pethidine at short time intervals and rapid accumulation of pethidine and norpethidine. The routine use of pethidine via PCA even for a brief postoperative analgesia should be reconsidered.
A high incidence of BRCA1 mutations in 20 breast-ovarian cancer families.
A highly accurate, low cost test for BRCA1 mutations.
A highly informative microsatellite marker, DXS426, which maps proximal to DXS7 in the interval Xp11. 4-Xp11 4-Xp11. 23, has been used to refine further the localisation of the gene for Norrie disease (NDP). The results from a multiply informative crossover localize the NDP gene proximal to DXS7. In conjunction with information from 2 NDP patients who have a deletion for DXS7 but not for DSX426, our data indicate that the NDP gene lies between DXS7 and DXS426 on proximal Xp.
A homologue of human protein kinase C (PKC)-related kinase-2, PRK2, which had previously escaped identification in normal mammalian tissues, was isolated from rat liver as the protease-activated kinase (PAK) originally named PAK-2. The 130-kDa cytosolic enzyme was purified to homogeneity and shown by tryptic peptide and reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-amplified rat cDNA sequence analyses to be structurally related to the 116-kDa rat hepatic PAK-1/protein kinase N (PKN) and, even more closely (95% sequence identity) to the 130-kDa human PKC-related kinase, PRK2. Rat myeloma RNA was used as the RT-PCR template because of its relative abundance in PAK-2/PRK2 mRNA compared with liver and other rat tissues. The catalytic properties of PAK-2/PRK2 in many respects resembled those of hepatic PAK-1/PKN, but were distinguished by more favorable kinetics with several peptide substrates, and greater sensitivity to PKC pseudosubstrate and polybasic amino acid inhibitors. PAK-2/PRK2 was also activated by lipids, particularly cardiolipin and to a lesser extent by other acidic phospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids. Cardiolipin activation was most evident with autophosphorylation and histone H2B phosphorylation, but only marginally evident with the favored ribosomal S6-(229-239) peptide substrate for the protease-activated kinase activity. It was concluded that PAK-2 is the rat homologue of human PRK2, with biochemical properties distinct from although overlapping those of the PAK-1/PKN/PRK1 isoform.
A human BRCA2 complex containing a structural DNA binding component influences cell cycle progression.
A human cDNA was cloned that encodes a DNA-binding protein (SATB1) that is expressed predominantly in thymus and binds selectively to the nuclear matrix/scaffold-associating DNAs (MARs/SARs). Missing nucleoside experiments showed that SATB1 selectively binds in a special AT-rich sequence context where one strand consists of mixed A's, T's, and C's, excluding G's (ATC sequences). When this feature is destroyed by mutation, SATB1 binding is greatly reduced even if the direct contact sequence remains intact. Conjunctional SATB1-binding sequences become stably unpaired in supercoiled DNA. Specific mutations that diminish the unwinding potential greatly reduce SATB1 binding. However, SATB1 does not bind single-stranded DNA. Chemical interference assays show that SATB1 binds along the minor groove with very little contact with the bases. This suggests that SATB1 recognizes the ATC sequence indirectly through the altered sugar-phosphate backbone structure present in the double-stranded DNA.
A human gene coding for a membrane-associated nucleic acid-binding protein.
A human homologue of the yeast HDEL receptor.
A human liver cDNA library was screened using a rat type 1 angiotensin II receptor cDNA coding sequence as a probe. cDNA clones were isolated which encoded a protein of 359 amino acids that shared 94.4% and 95.3% identify to rat and bovine type 1 angiotensin II receptors, respectively. Ligand binding studies of the cloned receptor expressed in COS cells suggested that it is pharmacologically a type 1 angiotensin II receptor subtype. Electrophysiological studies of the receptor expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that it could functionally couple to a second messenger system leading to the mobilization of intracellular stores of calcium. Southern and Northern blot analyses indicated that the cloned receptor is represented as a single copy in the human genome and is expressed in many tissues of different histogenic origin with the exception of brain, where mRNA transcripts were barely detectable.
A human mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease that is highly homologous to bacterial Lon protease.
A human mu opiate receptor cDNA has been identified from a cerebral cortical cDNA library using sequences from the rat mu opiate receptor cDNA. The human mu opiate receptor (h mu OR1) shares 95% amino acid identity with the rat sequence. The expressed mu OR1 recognized tested opiate drugs and opioid peptides in a sodium- and GTP-sensitive fashion with affinities virtually identical to those displayed by the rat mu opiate receptor. Effects on cyclic AMP are similar to those noted for the rat mu opiate receptor. An 18 kb genomic clone hybridizing with the h mu OR1 cDNA contains 63 and 489 bp exonic sequences flanked by splice donor/acceptor sequences. Analysis of hybridization to DNA prepared from human rodent hybrid cell lines and chromosomal in situ hybridization studies indicate localization to 6q24-25. An MspI polymorphism, producing a 3.7 kb band, may prove useful in assessing this gene's involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders involving opiatergic systems.
A human ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, L-UBC, maps in the Alzheimer's disease locus on chromosome 14q24.3.
A large family with dominantly inherited rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, premature arthropathy, and development of phalangeal epiphyseal dysplasia, resulting in brachydactyly was linked to COL2A1, the gene encoding proalpha1(II) collagen. Mutational analysis of the gene by exon sequencing identified a novel mutation in the C-propeptide region of the molecule. The glycine to aspartic acid change occurred in a region that is highly conserved in all fibrillar collagen molecules. The resulting phenotype does not fit easily into pre-existing subgroups of the type II collagenopathies, which includes spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and the Kniest, Strudwick, and Stickler dysplasias.
A large fragment of emerin cDNA was prepared by PCR and expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. Using this as immunogen, we prepared a panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies which recognise at least four different epitopes on emerin in order to ensure that emerin can be distinguished from non-specific cross-reacting proteins. All the mAbs recognised a 34 kDa protein in all tissues tested, though minor emerin-related bands were also detected in some tissues. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that emerin is located at the nuclear rim in all tissues examined. A muscle biopsy from an Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EMDM) patient showed complete absence of emerin by both Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, suggesting a simple diagnostic antibody test for EDMD families. Biochemical fractionation of brain and liver tissues showed that emerin was present in nuclei purified by centrifugation through 65% sucrose and was absent from soluble fractions (post-100, 000 g). From these results, together with sequence and structural homologies between emerin, thymopoietins and the nuclear lamina-associated protein, LAP2, we suggest that emerin will prove to be one member of a family of inner nuclear membrane proteins..
A large group of patients with suspected allergic reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics was evaluated. A detailed clinical history, together with skin tests, RAST (radioallergosorbent test), and controlled challenge tests, was used to establish whether patients allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics had selective immediate allergic responses to amoxicillin (AX) or were cross-reacting with other penicillin derivatives. Skin tests were performed with benzylpenicilloyl-poly-L-lysine (BPO-PLL), benzylpenicilloate, benzylpenicillin (PG), ampicillin (AMP), and AX. RAST for BPO-PLL and AX-PLL was done. When both skin test and RAST for BPO were negative, single-blind, placebo-controlled challenge tests were done to ensure tolerance of PG or sensitivity to AX. A total of 177 patients were diagnosed as allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics. We selected the 54 (30.5%) cases of immediate AX allergy with good tolerance of PG. Anaphylaxis was seen in 37 patients (69%), the other 17 (31%) having urticaria and/or angioedema. All the patients were skin test negative to BPO; 49 of 51 (96%) were also negative to MDM, and 44 of 46 (96%) to PG. Skin tests with AX were positive in 34 (63%) patients. RAST was positive for AX in 22 patients (41%) and to BPO in just 5 (9%). None of the sera with negative RAST for AX were positive to BPO. Challenge tests with AX were performed in 23 subjects (43%) to establish the diagnosis of immediate allergic reaction to AX, and in 15 cases (28%) both skin test and RAST for AX were negative. PG was well tolerated by all 54 patients. We describe the largest group of AX-allergic patients who have tolerated PG reported so far. Diagnosis of these patients can be achieved only if specific AX-related reagents are employed. Further studies are necessary to determine the exact extent of this problem and to improve the efficacy of diagnostic methods.
A large number of macrophage-derived foam cells stores excessive neutral lipids in intracellular droplets, and plays a major role during the development of atherosclerosis. The formation and catabolism of intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) are regulated by LD-associated proteins, a group of proteins which are located on the surface of LDs and regulate the formation, morphology and lipolysis of LDs. In order to illustrate the function of LD-associated proteins during the process of atherosclerosis, the foam cell model is induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) in macrophages originated from the THP-1 cell line, and cDNA microarrays are used to monitor the gene expression profiles of LD-associated proteins. Gene expression data show that 2% of changed genes are lipid binding genes during the transformation of foam cells. The major candidate genes, the cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector (CIDE) family and Perilipin, Adipophilin, and TIP47 (PAT) family, have different alterations during the formation of foam cells. CIDEB, CIDEC, Adipophilin, S3-12 and LSDP5 were up-regulated, while TIP47 was down-regulated. There was no significant change in CIDEA and Perilipin. These results were confirmed by real-time PCR and immunoblotting. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the gene expression of LD-associated proteins during the differentiation of human foam cells, which may play an important role in the process of atherosclerosis.
A large population-based follow-up study of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and cephalexin for uncommon serious drug toxicity.
A large proportion of non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness (NSARD) in many populations is caused by variants of the GJB2 gene. Here, the frequency of GJB2 variants was studied in 406 and 183 apparently unrelated children from Kenya and Sudan, respectively, with mostly severe to profound non-syndromic deafness. Nine (2.2 %) Kenyan and 12 (6.6 %) of the Sudanese children only were carriers of variants within the coding sequence of the GJB2 gene. Variants in the 5'-adjacent region were detected in further 115 individuals. A total of 10 novel variants was recognized, among them four variants in the adjacent 5'-region of the GJB2 coding exon 2 (g.3318-6T>A, g.3318-15C>T, g.3318-34C>T, g.3318-35T>G), a 6 base-pair deletion (g.3455_3460del [p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu]), a variant leading to a stop codon (g.3512C>A [p.Tyr65X]), synonymous variants (g.3395C>T [p.Thr26], g.3503C>T [p.Asn62], g.3627A>C [p.Arg104]), and one non-synonymous variant (g.3816C>A [p.Val167Met]). In addition, the previously described variants g.3352delG (commonly designated 30delG or 35 delG), g.3426G>A [p.Val37Ile], g.3697G>A [p.Arg127His], g.3774G>A [p.Val153Ile], and g.3795G>A [p.Gly160Ser] were identified. With the exception of g.3318-34C>T and g.3352delG, all variants occurred heterozygously. For most of the variants identified in the Kenyan and Sudanese study population, a causative association with NSARD appears to be unlikely. Compared to many other ethnic groups, deafness-associated variants of the coding region of GJB2 are rare in Sudan and Kenya, suggesting a role of other genetic, or epigenetic factors as a cause for deafness in these countries.
A linkage study in 30 Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) kindreds using three cloned DNA sequences from the X chromosome which demonstrate restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), suggests that the BMD gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome, in the p21 region. The genes for Becker and Duchenne dystrophies must therefore be closely linked, if not allelic, and any future DNA probes found to be of practical use in one disorder should be equally applicable to the other. The linkage analysis also provides data on the frequency of recombination along the short arm of the X chromosome, and across the centromeric region..
A major cytogenetic subgroup of lipomas is characterized by recurrent chromosome aberrations, mainly translocations, that involve chromosome segment 12q13-q15. Multiple chromosomes have been found as the translocation partners of chromosome 12 but 3q27-q28 is preferentially involved. In previous studies, it has been shown that the high mobility group (HMG) protein gene HMGIC at 12q15 is consistently rearranged as a consequence of these translocations. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the chromosome 3-derived translocation partner gene, which we have designated LPP (lipoma preferred partner gene). Using 3-RACE analysis of HMGIC fusion transcripts in lipoma cell line Li-501/SV40, ectopic genetic sequences were obtained, which by CASH (chromosome assignment using somatic cell hybrids) and FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) analysis were found to originate from chromosome segment 3q27-q28. In Northern blot analysis, an mRNA of over 10 kb was detected by these ectopic sequences in a variety of human tissues but not in brain and peripheral blood leukocytes. Upon partial cDNA cloning, features of the genetic organization of LPP were established. The gene was found to span a genomic region of over 400 kb. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a composite cDNA of LPP revealed an open reading frame of 1836 nucleotides encoding a proline-rich protein containing a leucine-zipper motif in its amino-terminal region and three LIM domains in its carboxy-terminal region. The LPP-encoded protein should be classified as a novel member of the group 3 proteins of the LIM protein gene family. Using reverse transcriptase combined with polymerase chain reactions in the analysis of a number of lipoma cell lines and primary lipomas, it appeared that LPP is frequently rearranged also in cases without a cytogenetically detectable involvement of 3q27-q28. Two alternative HMGIC/LPP hybrid transcripts have been detected; the difference between them is mainly the presence of either two or three LIM domains in the predicted HMGI-C/LPP fusion proteins..
A male in his sixties with no history of cardiac chest pain awoke with chest pain following an afternoon sleep. The patient did not self medicate. The patient's observations were within normal limits, he was administered oxygen via a face mask and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Several minutes after the GTN the patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate, this was rectified by atropine sulphate and a fluid challenge. There was no further deterioration in the patient's condition during transport to hospital. There are very few documented case like this in the prehospital scientific literature. The cause appears to be the Bezold-Jarish reflex, stimulation of the ventricular walls which in turn decreases sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor centre. Prehospital care providers who are managing any patient with a syncopal episode that fails to recover within a reasonable time frame should consider the Bezold-Jarisch reflex as the cause and manage the patient accordingly.
A male neonate with a Chiari malformation and a leaking myelomeningocoele underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion followed by repair of myelomeningocoele. During anaesthesia and surgery, he inadvertently became moderately hypothermic. Intravenous phenytoin was administered during the later part of the surgery for seizure prophylaxis. Following phenytoin administration, the patient developed acute severe bradycardia, refractory to atropine and adrenaline. The cardiac depressant actions of phenytoin and hypothermia can be additive. Administration of phenytoin in the presence of hypothermia may lead to an adverse cardiac event in children. As phenytoin is a commonly used drug, clinicians need to be aware of this interaction.
A mammalian homolog of Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional coactivator intersex is a subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex.
A mannose-specific membrane lectin (MR60) isolated from human myelomonocytic HL60 cells by affinity chromatography is expressed in intracellular organelles of immature monocytes (Pimpaneau, V., Midoux, P., Monsigny, M., and Roche, A. C. (1991) Carbohydr. Res. 213, 95-108). It is not present at the cell surface and is immunochemically and structurally distinct from the M(r) 175,000 mannose receptor of mature macrophages. MR60 cDNA was isolated and characterized; on the basis of its sequence, MR60 is not related to any known mammalian lectins. Surprisingly, MR60 was found to be identical to ERGIC-53 (Schindler, R., Itin, C., Zerial, M., Lottspeich, F., and Hauri, H.P. (1993) Eur. J. Cell Biol. 61, 1-9), a type I integral membrane protein, defined as a marker of the intermediate compartment that recycles between the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum; MR60/ERGIC-53 shares with VIP-36 significant homologies with leguminous plant lectins (Fiedler, K., and Simmons, K. (1994) Cell 77, 625-626). We extend these findings in evidencing a structural homology between MR60/ERGIC-53 and mammalian galectins (soluble beta galactose binding proteins). MR60/ERGIC-53 is the first lectin characterized as an endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi protein. Accordingly, this intracellular mannose binding protein could be involved in the traffic of glycoproteins between endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.
A measure of pupillary oscillation as a marker of cocaine-induced paranoia.
A method for the measurement of tremor, and a comparison of the effects of tocolytic beta-mimetics.
A method permitting measurement of finger tremor as a displacement-time curve is described, using a test system with simple amplitude calibration. The coordinates of the inversion points of the displacement-time curves were transferred through graphical input equipment to punched tape. By means of a computer program, periods and amplitudes of tremor oscillations were calculated and classified. The event frequency for each class of periods and amplitudes was determined. The actions of fenoterol-hydrobromide, ritodrin-HCl and placebo given to 10 healthy subjects by intravenous infusion in a double-blind crossover study were tested by this method. At therapeutic doses both substances raised the mean tremor amplitude to about three times the control level. At the same time, the mean period within each class of amplitudes shortened by 10--20 ms, whereas the mean periods calculated from all oscillations together did not change significantly. After the end of fenoterol-hydrobromide infusion, tremor amplitudes decreased significantly faster than those following ritodrin-HCl infusion.

A missense mutation has been identified in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase [PAH; phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase; L-phenylalanine, tetrahydrobiopterin oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating), EC 1. 14. 16. 1] gene in a Chinese patient with classic phenylketonuria (PKU). A G-to-C transition at the second base of codon 413 in exon 12 of the gene results in the substitution of Pro413 for Arg413 in the mutant protein. This mutation (R413P) results in negligible enzymatic activity when expressed in heterologous mammalian cells and is compatible with a classic PKU phenotype in the patient. Population genetic studies reveal that this mutation is tightly linked to restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotype 4, which is the predominant haplotype of the PAH locus in the Oriental population. It accounts for 13. 8% of northern Chinese and 27% of Japanese PKU alleles, but it is rare in southern Chinese (2. 2%) and is absent in the Caucasian population. The data demonstrate unambiguously that the mutation occurred after racial divergence of Orientals and Caucasians and suggest that the allele has spread throughout the Orient by a founder effect. Previous protein polymorphism studies in eastern Asia have led to the hypothesis that " northern Mongoloids " represented a founding population in Asia. Our results are compatible with this hypothesis in that the PKU mutation might have occurred in northern Mongoloids and subsequently spread to the Chinese and Japanese populations.

A mouse with X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency has been recovered in offspring of 1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea-treated male mice. The activity alteration was detected in blood but can also be observed in other tissue extracts. Hemizygous, heterozygous, and homozygous mutants have, respectively, about 15, 60, and 15% G6PD remaining activity in the blood as compared to the wild type. Erythrocyte indices did not show differences between mutants and wild types. The mutation does not affect the electrophoretic migration, the isoelectric point, or the thermal stability. Kinetic properties, such as the Km for glucose-6-phosphate or for NADP and the relative utilization of substrate analogues, showed no differences between wild types and mutants with the exception of the relative utilization of deamino-NADP which was significantly lower in mutants. This is presently the only animal model for X-linked G6PD deficiency in humans..
A multicenter study was performed in 110 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Adriamycin (50 mg/50 ml) was administered intravesically within 24 h after transurethral resection of TA-T1 (O-A) bladder tumors. Instillation was repeated twice during the first week, then weekly during the first month and afterwards monthly for 1 year. The tolerance was evaluated in these 110 patients, and 29 patients presented with local side-effects. In 24 of these patients chemical cystitis was severe enough for them to drop out of the study. No systemic side-effects were observed. Recurrence was studied in 82 evaluable patients after 1 year of follow-up and in 72 patients followed for 2-3 years (mean 32 months). Of the 82 patients studied after 1 year, 23 had primary and 59 recurrent disease. Of the 82 evaluable patients, 50 did not show any recurrence after 1 year (61%), while 32 presented with one or more recurrences (39%). Of these recurrences, 27 were T1 tumors while five progressed to more highly invasive lesions. In patients that were free of recurrence during the first year, 80% remained tumor-free during the 2- to 3-year follow-up period. Of the patients developing one or more recurrences during the first year, only 50% presented with further recurrence once the instillations were stopped. The beneficial effect of Adriamycin appears obvious and might be related to the drug itself, the early and repeated instillations after TUR, or both.
A multiparous woman in good psychological health underwent urgent caesarean section in labour. Postoperatively, she was given a patient-controlled analgesia device delivering boluses of diamorphine 0.5 mg and droperidol 0.025 mg. Whilst using the device she gradually became anxious, the feeling worsening after each bolus. The diagnosis of droperidol-induced psychological disturbance was not made straight away although on subsequent close questioning the patient gave a very clear history. After she had received a total of only 0.9 mg droperidol, a syringe containing diamorphine only was substituted and her unease resolved completely. We feel that, although the dramatic extrapyramidal side effects of dopaminergic antiemetics are well known, more subtle manifestations may easily be overlooked.
A multivesicular body is a vesicle-filled endosome that targets proteins to the interior of lysosomes. We have identified a conserved eukaryotic protein, human CHMP1, which is strongly implicated in multivesicular body formation. Immunocytochemistry and biochemical fractionation localize CHMP1 to early endosomes and CHMP1 physically interacts with SKD1/VPS4, a highly conserved protein directly linked to multivesicular body sorting in yeast. Similar to the action of a mutant SKD1 protein, overexpression of a fusion derivative of human CHMP1 dilates endosomal compartments and disrupts the normal distribution of several endosomal markers. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae further support a conserved role of CHMP1 in vesicle trafficking. Deletion of CHM1, the budding yeast homolog of CHMP1, results in defective sorting of carboxypeptidases S and Y and produces abnormal, multi-lamellar prevacuolar compartments. This phenotype classifies CHM1 as a member of the class E vacuolar protein sorting genes. Yeast Chm1p belongs to a structurally-related, but rather divergent family of proteins, including Vps24p and Snf7p and three novel proteins, Chm2p, Chm5p and Chm6p, which are all essential for multivesicular body sorting. These observations identify the conserved CHMP/Chmp family as a set of proteins fundamental to understanding multivesicular body sorting in eukaryotic organisms.
A murine model of adenomyosis: the effects of hyperprolactinemia induced by fluoxetine hydrochloride, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on adenomyosis induction in Wistar albino rats.
A mutated cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) was identified as a tumor-specific antigen recognized by HLA-A2. 1-restricted autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in a human melanoma. The mutated CDK4 allele was present in autologous cultured melanoma cells and metastasis tissue, but not in the patients lymphocytes. The mutation, an arginine-to-cysteine exchange at residue 24, was part of the CDK4 peptide recognized by CTLs and prevented binding of the CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4a, but not of p21 or of p27KIP1. The same mutation was found in one additional melanoma among 28 melanomas analyzed. These results suggest that mutation of CDK4 can create a tumor-specific antigen and can disrupt the cell-cycle regulation exerted by the tumor suppressor p16INK4a..
A mutation common in non-Jewish Tay-Sachs disease: frequency and RNA studies.
A mutation in OTOF, encoding otoferlin, a FER-1-like protein, causes DFNB9, a nonsyndromic form of deafness.
A mutation in autosomal dominant myotonia congenita affects pore properties of the muscle chloride channel.
A mutation in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the FGD1 gene in an Italian family with faciogenital dysplasia (Aarskog-Scott syndrome).
A myotonic dystrophy (DM) family is described in which discordant DM phenotypes were found in the children of two affected sisters with similar CTG expansion and clinical manifestations. In this family, congenital as well as early severe childhood and later childhood onset DM coexist. This observation strengthens the limited ability of lymphocytes CTG repeat number analysis in predicting genotype-phenotype correlations in DM patients..
A neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) is a widespread amyloid deposition. We analyzed the entire amino acid sequences in an amyloid preparation and found, in addition to the major beta/A4-protein (A beta) fragment, two unknown peptides. We raised antibodies against synthetic peptides using subsequences of these peptides. These antibodies immunostained amyloid in neuritic and diffuse plaques as well as vascular amyloid. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that the immunostaining was localized on amyloid fibrils. We have isolated an apparently full-length cDNA encoding a 140-amino-acid protein within which two previously unreported amyloid sequences are encoded in tandem in the most hydrophobic domain. We tentatively named this 35-amino acid peptide NAC (non-A beta component of AD amyloid) and its precursor NACP. NAC is the second component, after A beta, identified chemically in the purified AD amyloid preparation. Secondary structure predictions indicate that the NAC peptide sequence has a strong tendency to form beta-structures consistent with its association with amyloid. NACP is detected as a M(r) 19,000 protein in the cytosolic fraction of brain homogenates and comigrates on immunoblots with NACP synthesized in Escherichia coli from NACP cDNA. NACP mRNA is expressed principally in brain but is also expressed in low concentrations in all tissues examined except in liver, suggesting its ubiquitous and brain-specific functions. The availability of the cDNA encoding full-length NACP should help to elucidate the mechanisms of amyloidosis in AD.
A new CT pattern in adrenoleukodystrophy.
A new CT pattern was observed in 2 patients with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). This pattern, which the authors call Type II, is characterized by the absence of posterior periventricular areas of decreased attenuation around the trigone on non-contrast scans after contrast infusion, however, there is striking enhancement of various white-matter structures (tracts or fiber systems) such as the internal capsules, corpus callosum, corona radiata, forceps major, and cerebral peduncles. This is different from numerous previous descriptions of the CT pattern in ALD. Type II ALD does not appear to have been seen in any other leukoencephalopathy and is probably specific for a phenotypic variant or an evolving stage of ALD..
A new Rab6 homolog cDNA, Rab6c, was discovered by a hypermethylated DNA fragment probe that was isolated from a human multidrug resistant (MDR) breast cancer cell line, MCF7/AdrR, by the methylation sensitive-representational difference analysis (MS-RDA) technique. Rab6c was found to be under-expressed in MCF7/AdrR and MES-SA/Dx5 (a human MDR uterine sarcoma cell line) compared with their non-MDR parental cell lines. MCF7/AdrR cells expressing the exogenous Rab6c exhibited less resistance to several anti-cancer drugs, such as doxorubicin (DOX), taxol, vinblastine, and vincristine, than the control cells containing the empty vector. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed that the transfectants' diminished resistance to DOX was caused by increased drug accumulation induced by the exogenous Rab6c. These results indicate that Rab6c is involved in drug resistance in MCF7/AdrR cells.
A new cytokine (IK) down-regulating HLA class II: monoclonal antibodies, cloning and chromosome localization.
A new family of ras-related proteins, designated rac (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate) has been identified. rac1 and rac2 cDNA clones were isolated from a differentiated HL-60 library and encode proteins that are 92% homologous and share 58% and 26-30% amino acid homology with human rhos and ras, respectively. Nucleotide sequence analysis predicts both rac1 and rac2 proteins to contain 192 amino acids with molecular masses of 21,450 and 21,429 daltons, respectively. rac1 and rac2 possess four of the five conserved functional domains in ras associated with binding and hydrolysis of guanine nucleotides. They also contain the COOH-terminal consensus sequence Cys-X-X-X-COOH which localizes ras to the inner plasma membrane and the residues Gly12 and Ala59, at which sites mutations elicit transforming potential to ras. The rac transcripts, particularly rac2, display relative myeloid tissue selectivity. Both rac1 transcripts (2.4 and 1.1 kilobases (kb] increase when HL-60 cells differentiate to neutrophil-like morphology. In contrast, differentiation of U937 cells to monocyte-like morphology causes no change in the 2.4-kb mRNA and a decrease in the 1.1-kb mRNA species. rac2 mRNA (1.45 kb) increases 7-9-fold and 3-fold upon differentiation of HL-60 and U937 cells, respectively. Neither rac mRNAs are present in a Jurkat T cell line, and unlike rac1, rac2 mRNA is absent in human brain and liver tissue. Transfection experiments permitted the demonstration that rac1 and rac2 are substrates for ADP-ribosylation by the C3 component of botulinum toxin. The data suggest that racs are plasma membrane-associated GTP-binding proteins which could regulate secretory processes, particularly in myeloid cells.
A new fragile site (FRAXE) in Xq28 is described. It appears to be a typical folate sensitive fragile site. The fragile site is not associated with mental retardation, it does not give abnormal results when subjected to Southern analysis with probe pfxa3 which detects the unstable DNA sequence characteristic of fragile X syndrome. In situ hybridization mapping locates the fragile site between 150 kb and 600 kb distal to FRAXA. The distinction between the two fragile sites is important clinically since cytogenetic detection of FRAXE, without molecular analysis, could result in misdiagnosis of fragile X syndrome..
A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variant associated with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia was reported. The patient, a 6-year-old Japanese male, was noticed to have hemolytic anemia soon after birth, and a diagnosis of G6PD deficiency was made at the age of 2. He had episodes of hemolytic crisis several times after upper respiratory infection. G6PD activity of the patient was 5. 5% of normal. The enzymatic characteristics were examined when he was 5 years old, and his G6PD showed faster-than-normal electrophoretic mobility, low Km G6P, high Km NADP, low Ki NADPH, normal utilization of substrate analogues, heat instability, and a normal pH optimum curve. From these results, this was considered to be a new variant and was designated G6PD Nagano. Infection-induced hemolysis and chronic hemolytic anemia seem to be due to markedly impaired enzyme activity and thermal instability.
A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variant with severe erythrocytic G6PD deficiency and a unique pH optimum is described in a young patient with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). Chronic hemolysis was present in the absence of infections, oxidant drugs or ingestion of faba beans. Residual enzyme activity was about 2. 6% and 63% of normal activity in erythrocytes and leucocytes, respectively. A molecular study using standard methods showed G6PD in the patient to have normal electrophoretic mobility (at pH 7. 0, 8. 0 and 8. 8), normal apparent affinity for substrates (Km, G6P and NADP) and a slightly abnormal utilization of substrate analogues (decreased deamino-NADP and increased 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate utilization). Heat stability was found to be markedly decreased (8% of residual activity after 20 min of incubation at 46 degrees C) and a particular characteristic of this enzyme was a biphasic pH curve with a greatly increased activity at low pH. Although molecular characteristics of this variant closely resemble those of G6PD Bangkok and G6PD Duarte, it can be distinguished from these and all other previously reported variants by virtue of its unusual pH curve. Therefore the present variant has been designated G6PD Clinic to distinguish it from other G6PD variants previously described
A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant (G6PD Nagano) associated with congenital hemolytic anemia.
A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant, G6PD Orissa (44 Ala-->Gly), is the major polymorphic variant in tribal populations in India.
A new member of the Bcl-2 family was identified, Bcl-G. The human BCL-G gene consists of 6 exons, resides on chromosome 12p12, and encodes two proteins through alternative mRNA splicing, Bcl-G(L) (long) and Bcl-G(S) (short) consisting of 327 and 252 amino acids in length, respectively. Bcl-G(L) and Bcl-G(S) have identical sequences for the first 226 amino acids but diverge thereafter. Among the Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains previously recognized in Bcl-2 family proteins, the BH3 domain is found in both Bcl-G(L) and Bcl-G(S), but only the longer Bcl-G(L) protein possesses a BH2 domain. Bcl-G(L) mRNA is expressed widely in adult human tissues, whereas Bcl-G(S) mRNA was found only in testis. Overexpression of Bcl-G(L) or Bcl-G(S) in cells induced apoptosis although Bcl-G(S) was far more potent than Bcl-G(L). Apoptosis induction by Bcl-G(S) depended on the BH3 domain and was suppressed by coexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-X(L) protein. Bcl-X(L) also coimmunoprecipitated with Bcl-G(S) but not with mutants of Bcl-G(S) in which the BH3 domain was deleted or mutated or with Bcl-G(L). Bcl-G(S) was predominantly localized to cytosolic organelles, whereas Bcl-G(L) was diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol. A mutant of Bcl-G(L) in which the BH2 domain was deleted displayed increased apoptotic activity and coimmunoprecipitated with Bcl-X(L), suggesting that the BH2 domain autorepresses Bcl-G(L).
A new mutation in the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene in a German family with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.
A new platelet-specific alloantigen, termed Sit (a), was identified in a severe case of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. The Sit (a) alloantigen is of low frequency (1/400) in the German population. Immunochemical studies demonstrated that the Sit (a) epitopes reside on platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ia. Nucleotide sequence analysis of GPIa cDNA derived from Sit (a) -positive platelets showed C (2531) -- > T (2531) point mutation, resulting in Thr (799) Met dimorphism. Analysis of genomic DNA from 22 Sit (a) -negative normal individuals showed that the Thr (799) is encoded by ACG (2532) (90. 9%) or ACA (2532) (9. 1%). To establish a DNA typing technique, we elucidated the organization of the GPIa gene adjacent to the polymorphic bases. The introns (421 bp and 1. 2 kb) encompass a 142-bp exon with the 2 polymorphic bases 2531 and 2532. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on DNA derived from 100 donors using the restriction enzyme Mae III showed that the Met (799) form of GPIa is restricted to Sit (a) (+) phenotype. Analysis of stable Chinese hamster ovary transfectants expressing allele-specific recombinant forms of GPIa showed that anti-Sit (a) exclusively reacted with the Glu (505) Met (799), but not with the Glu (505) Thr (799) and the Lys (505) Thr (799) isoforms. In contrast, anti-Br (a) (HPA-5b) only recognized the Lys (505) Thr (799) form, whereas anti-Br (b) (HPA-5a) reacted with both Glu (505) Thr (799) and Glu (505) Met (799) isoforms. These results demonstrated that the Met (799) is responsible for formation of the Sit (a) alloantigenic determinants, whereas amino acid 505 (Lys or Glu) specifically controls the expression of Br (a) and Br (b) epitopes, respectively. Platelet aggregation responses of Sit (a) (+) individuals were diminished in response to collagen, indicating that the Thr (799) Met mutation affects the function of the GPIa/IIa complex
A new spectrin, beta IV, has a major truncated isoform that associates with promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies and the nuclear matrix.
A newborn with massive tricuspid regurgitation, atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, and a high serum lithium level is described. This is the first patient to initially manifest tricuspid regurgitation and atrial flutter, and the 11th described patient with cardiac disease among infants exposed to lithium compounds in the first trimester of pregnancy. Sixty-three percent of these infants had tricuspid valve involvement. Lithium carbonate may be a factor in the increasing incidence of congenital heart disease when taken during early pregnancy. It also causes neurologic depression, cyanosis, and cardiac arrhythmia when consumed prior to delivery.
A normal male with an inherited deletion of one exon within the DMD gene.
A novel Arg362Ser mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27): its effects on pre-mRNA splicing and enzyme activity.
A novel C to A mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27) was identified by sequencing amplified CYP27 gene products from a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). The mutation changed the adrenodoxin cofactor binding residue 362Arg to 362Ser (CGT 362Arg to AGT 362Ser), and was responsible for deficiency in the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, as confirmed by expression of mutant cDNA into COS-1 cells. Quantitative analysis showed that the expression of CYP27 gene mRNA in the patient represented 52. 5% of the normal level. As the mutation occurred at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 (-2 position of exon 6-intron 6 splice site) of the gene, we hypothesized that the mutation may partially affect the normal splicing efficiency in exon 6 and cause alternative splicing elsewhere, which resulted in decreased transcript in the patient. Transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the mutation, into COS-1 cells confirmed that the mutant minigene was responsible for a mRNA species alternatively spliced at an activated cryptic 5 splice site 88 bp upstream from the 3 end of exon 6. Our data suggest that the C to A mutation at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 of the CYP27 gene not only causes the deficiency in the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, but also partially leads to alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding effects on pre-mRNA splicing of a mutation at the -2 position of a 5 splice site.
A novel CC chemokine, HCC-1, was isolated from the hemofiltrate of patients with chronic renal failure. HCC-1 has a relative molecular mass of 8,673 and consists of 74 amino acids including four cysteines linked to disulfide bonds. HCC-1 cDNA was cloned from human bone marrow and shown to code for the mature protein plus a putative 19-residue leader sequence. Mature HCC-1 has sequence identity of 46% with macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta, and 29-37% with the other human CC chemokines. Unlike MIP-1 alpha and the other CC chemokines, HCC-1 is expressed constitutively in several normal tissues (spleen, liver, skeletal and heart muscle, gut, and bone marrow), and is present at high concentrations (1-80 nM) in plasma. HCC-1 has weak activities on human monocytes and acts via receptors that also recognize MIP-1 alpha. It induced intracellular Ca2+ changes and enzyme release, but no chemotaxis, at concentrations of 100-1,000 nM, and was inactive on T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophil leukocytes. In addition, HCC-1 enhanced the proliferation of CD34+ myeloid progenitor cells. It was as effective as MIP-1 alpha, but about 100-fold less potent.

A novel disease with deficiency of mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.
A novel family of cofactors that differentially interact with homeoproteins have been identified via a yeast two-hybrid screen. The proteins contain a conserved protein kinase domain that is separated from a domain that interacts with homeoproteins and hence are termed homeodomain-interacting protein kinases (HIPKs): HIPK1, HIPK2, and HIPK3. We show that HIPKs are nuclear kinases using GFP-HIPK fusion constructs. The DNA binding activity of the NK-3 homeoprotein is greatly enhanced by HIPK2, but this effect is independent of its phosphorylation by HIPK2. In cultured cells, HIPKs localize to nuclear speckles and potentiate the repressor activities of NK homeoproteins. The co-repressor activity of HIPKs depends on both its homeodomain interaction domain and a co-repressor domain that maps to the N terminus. Thus, HIPKs represent a heretofore undescribed family of co-repressors for homeodomain transcription factors.
A novel form of cytochrome P-450 family 4 in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. cDNA cloning and expression of leukotriene B4 omega-hydroxylase.
A novel frameshift mutation in the McLeod syndrome gene in a Japanese family.
A novel full-length cDNA showing homology with rho genes was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library. Sequencing of a total of 1086 nucleotides of this clone revealed an open reading frame of 630 nucleotides (210 amino acids). In view of its degree of homology to members of the Rho family of molecules (50-54% identical amino acids, 60-63% identical nucleotides within the coding region), the predicted product was designated RhoHP1(Rho-related protein HP1). Northern analysis indicated that a message about 1.2-kb long is expressed in human heart, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas and, with weaker intensity, in several other tissues.
A novel gene, MEL1, mapped to 1p36.3 is highly homologous to the MDS1/EVI1 gene and is transcriptionally activated in t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive leukemia cells.

A novel human cDNA encoding a small secretory glycopeptide specifically expressed within the caput and proximal corpus regions of the human epididymis, HE2, has been cloned and sequenced. Southern hybridization analysis showed it to be derived from a single-copy gene. A subclone containing the coding region of the mature peptide was used to generate the putatively encoded peptide as a 10,000 M(r) recombinant fusion protein in a bacterial expression system. This recombinant HE2 protein, as well as an oligopeptide deduced from the open-reading frame, was used to raise polyclonal antisera. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence showed that the predicted HE2 peptide is present in the epididymal epithelium and on the sperm surface, where it adopts a typical antigenic pattern with a subacrosomal equatorial distribution on the sperm head.
A novel human gene referred to as the Rep-8 gene (D8S2298E) was cloned by a combination of exon trapping, thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR, and screening of a cDNA library. It is located in human chromosome 8p11.2-p12. The gene consists of eight exons and spans about 20 kb between the glutathione S-reductase and the protein phosphatase 2A beta subunit genes. The full-length Rep-8 gene contains 1483 nucleotides and codes for a protein of 270 amino acids. Southern blot experiments showed that the Rep-8 gene exists as a single copy per haploid. With a zoo blot analysis, human Rep-8 DNA hybridized strongly with the monkey DNA, but only weakly with the DNAs of species other than Homo sapiens. Northern blot analysis showed that it is expressed abundantly in the testis and ovary, suggesting that the Rep-8 gene product may play a role in reproduction.
A novel human gene, LAF-4, was isolated from a subtracted cDNA library that showed strong sequence similarity to AF-4, a gene that is translocated in t(4;11)(q21;q23) acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In t(4;11) ALL, the AF-4 gene at 4q21 is translocated into the MLL locus at 11q23, resulting in the expression of an MLL/AF-4 fusion protein that is the presumptive oncoprotein. AF-4 and LAF-4 are homologous throughout their coding regions, yet neither protein is related to previously cloned genes. Human LAF-4 readily hybridized with genes in mouse and chicken, thus showing that this gene family has been highly conserved during vertebrate evolution. In mouse tissues, LAF-4 mRNA was found to be present at highest levels in lymphoid tissues, present at lower levels in brain and lung, and absent from other tissues. In human and mouse lymphoid cell lines, LAF-4 expression was highest in pre-B cells, intermediate in mature B cells, and absent in plasma cells, thus pointing to a potential regulatory role for LAF-4 in lymphoid development. Antibodies to LAF-4 showed it to be a nuclear protein that showed an uneven, granular immunofluorescence pattern. In vitro-translated LAF-4 was able to bind strongly to double-stranded DNA cellulose. Furthermore, both LAF-4 and AF-4 had domains that activated transcription strongly when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, the AF-4 transactivation domain is retained in the MLL/AF-4 fusion protein; thus, it may contribute to the transforming potential of the oncoprotein. Therefore, the cloning of LAF-4 has defined a new family of potential regulatory proteins that may function in lymphoid development and oncogenesis.
A novel human odorant-binding protein gene family resulting from genomic duplicons at 9q34: differential expression in the oral and genital spheres.
A novel human protease similar to the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme induces apoptosis in transfected cells.
A novel human serine-threonine phosphatase related to the Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) gene is selectively expressed in sensory neurons of neural crest origin.
A novel immunoglobulin superfamily receptor (19A) related to CD2 is expressed on activated lymphocytes and promotes homotypic B-cell adhesion.
A novel lymphocyte-specific immunoglobulin superfamily protein (19A) has been cloned. The predicted 335-amino-acid sequence of 19A represents a Type 1 membrane protein with homology with the CD2 family of receptors. A molecular model of the two predicted extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains of 19A has been generated using the crystal structure of CD2 as a template. In isolated lymphocytes, expression of 19A is induced by various activation stimuli, and enforced expression of the 19A gene promotes homotypic cell adhesion in a B-cell-line model. Collectively these data imply that the 19A protein plays a role in regulation of lymphocyte adhesion.
A novel mammalian iron-regulated protein involved in intracellular iron metabolism.
A novel mammalian protein, p55CDC, present in dividing cells is associated with protein kinase activity and has homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell division cycle proteins Cdc20 and Cdc4.
A novel matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) was identified from leukocytes and found to be specifically expressed by peripheral blood leukocytes among 29 different tissues examined. Named leukolysin, it encodes for 562 residues with a conserved MMP structure, i.e., pre-, pro-, catalytic, hinge- and hemopexin-like domains, but also a RXK/RR motif, known for its role in MMP zymogen activation, and a C-terminal hydrophobic segment. Overall, leukolysin displays the strongest homology to the newly identified MT-MMP subgroup with 45% and 39% identities to MT4- and MT1-MMPs vs 30% and 31.5% to MMP1 and 3 respectively. Unlike MT4-MMP whose proteolytic activity remains undefined, a C-terminally truncated leukolysin is expressed as a strong gelatinolytic species at 28 kDa which is derived from a cell-associated 34 kDa proenzyme, presumably by furin or proprotein convertase mediated removal of the propeptide (approximately 6 kDa). By green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging, the intracellular proenzyme is localized to granules throughout the cell, suggesting that activation occur immediately prior to secretion. Taken together, leukolysin may be part of the proteolytic arsenal deployed by leukocytes during inflammatory responses. Molecular cloning of a novel MMP: MMP:25
A novel missense mutation in patients from a retinoblastoma pedigree showing only mild expression of the tumor phenotype.
A novel mutation in the sodium/iodide symporter gene in the largest family with iodide transport defect.
A novel procedure is presented to estimate the ratio of male to female mutation rates for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). X-specific restriction fragment length polymorphisms are used to establish DNA haplotypes in three-generation DMD families. From the proportion of DMD patients who have inherited their maternal grandfathers X chromosome, the ratio of mutation rates can be calculated. In contrast to classical methods, the proposed procedure is not restricted to sporadic or familiar cases nor is any information on the carrier status of female relatives required..
A novel protein, p55CDC, has been identified in cycling mammalian cells. This transcript is readily detectable in all exponentially growing cell lines but disappears when cells are chemically induced to fall out of the cell cycle and differentiate. The p55CDC protein appears to be essential for cell division, since transfection of antisense p55CDC cDNA into CHO cells resulted in isolation of only those cells which exhibited a compensatory increase in p55CDC transcripts in the sense orientation. Immunoprecipitation of p55CDC yielded protein complexes with kinase activity which fluctuated during the cell cycle. Since p55CDC does not have the conserved protein kinase domains, this activity must be due to one or more of the associated proteins in the immune complex. The highest levels of protein kinase activity were seen with alpha-casein and myelin basic protein as substrates and demonstrated a pattern of activity distinct from that described for the known cyclin-dependent cell division kinases. The p55CDC protein was also phosphorylated in dividing cells. The amino acid sequence of p55CDC contains seven repeats homologous to the beta subunit of G proteins, and the highest degree of homology in these repeats was found with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc20 and Cdc4 proteins, which have been proposed to be involved in the formation of a functional bipolar mitotic spindle in yeast cells. The G beta repeat has been postulated to mediate protein-protein interactions and, in p55CDC, may modulate its association with a unique cell cycle protein kinase. These findings suggest that p55CDC is a component of the mammalian cell cycle mechanism.
A novel secreted glycoprotein that regulates bone resorption has been identified. The protein, termed Osteoprotegerin (OPG), is a novel member of the TNF receptor superfamily. In vivo, hepatic expression of OPG in transgenic mice results in a profound yet nonlethal osteopetrosis, coincident with a decrease in later stages of osteoclast differentiation. These same effects are observed upon administration of recombinant OPG into normal mice. In vitro, osteoclast differentiation from precursor cells is blocked in a dose-dependent manner by recombinant OPG. Furthermore, OPG blocks ovariectomy-associated bone loss in rats. These data show that OPG can act as a soluble factor in the regulation of bone mass and imply a utility for OPG in the treatment of osteoporosis associated with increased osteoclast activity.
A novel secretory tumor necrosis factor-inducible protein (TSG-6) is a member of the family of hyaluronate binding proteins, closely related to the adhesion receptor CD44.

A p16INK4a-insensitive CDK4 mutant targeted by cytolytic T lymphocytes in a human melanoma.
A pair of female monozygotic (MZ) twins, heterozygous carriers for a deletion in the DMD gene and discordant for the clinical manifestations of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, were analyzed by molecular studies, in situ hybridization, and methylation pattern of X chromosomes to search for opposite X inactivation as an explanation of their clinical discordance. Results in lymphocytes and skin fibroblast cell lines suggest a partial mirror inactivation with the normal X chromosome preferentially active in the unaffected twin, and the maternal deleted X chromosome preferentially active in the affected twin. A review shows that MZ female twins discordant for X-linked diseases are not uncommon. Twinning and X inactivation may be interrelated and could explain the female twins discordant for X-linked traits..
A panel of eight unrelated subjects with inherited type I protein S deficiency was screened for mutations in the PROS1 gene. In five subjects an abnormality was found but mutations were not detected in the remaining three subjects. Two subjects shared a G-- > A transition at position + 5 of the donor splice site consensus sequence of intron 10. Also in two subjects an A-- > T transversion was detected in the stopcodon of the PROS1 gene; this transversion predicts a protein S molecule that is extended by 14 amino acids. The fifth subject was found to possess two sequence abnormalities. One allele carried a G-- > A transition near the donor splice junction of intron 2, but this abnormality is probably neutral, since it was inherited from the parent with normal protein S antigen levels. In the other allele a single T insertion in codon -25 was found. Analysis of platelet RNA showed that only the mRNA with the A-- > T mutation in the stopcodon is present in amounts comparable to wildtype RNA. mRNA from the alleles with the other two mutations was either undetectable or present in greatly reduced amounts. The latter indicates that a mRNA based approach is not feasible for the genetic analysis of protein S deficiency type I..
A panel of patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD) has been screened with the cDNA probes Cf56a and Cf23a, which detect exons in the central part of the DMD gene. One or more exons were deleted in 60% of patients. The deletions were mapped and prove to be heterogeneous in size and extent, particularly in DMD. Deletions specific to DMD and to BMD are described. Half of all BMD patients have a deletion of one particular small group of exons; smaller deletions within this same group produce the more severe DMD..
A patient developed a severe cholinergic syndrome from the use of echothiophate iodide ophthalmic drops, presented with profound muscle weakness and was initially given the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Red blood cell and serum cholinesterase levels were severely depressed and symptoms resolved spontaneously following discontinuation of the eye drops.
A patient taking diphenylhydantoin for 3 weeks developed a generalized skin rash, lymphadenopathy and pure red cell aplasia. After withdrawal of the pharmacon all symptoms disappeared spontaneously. Skin rash is a well-known complication of diphenylhydantoin treatment as is benign and malignant lymphadenopathy. Pure red cell aplasia associated with diphenylhydantoin medication has been reported in 3 patients. The exact mechanism by which diphenylhydantoin exerts its toxic effects is not known. In this patient the time relation between the ingestion of diphenylhydantoin and the occurrence of the skin rash, lymphadenopathy and pure red cell aplasia is very suggestive of a direct connection.
A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over-the-counter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate, caffeine, and acetaminophen displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of caffeine per mL of serum. Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the CNS, attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen (52 micrograms/mL) reduced the CNS toxicity of caffeine. Studies in DBA/2J mice showed that: 1) pretreatment with acetaminophen (100 mg/kg) increased the interval between the administration of caffeine (300 to 450 mg/kg IP) and the onset of fatal convulsions by a factor of about two; and 2) pretreatment with acetaminophen (75 mg/kg) reduced the incidence of audiogenic seizures produced in the presence of caffeine (12.5 to 75 mg/kg IP). The frequency of sound-induced seizures after 12.5 or 25 mg/kg caffeine was reduced from 50 to 5% by acetaminophen. In the absence of caffeine, acetaminophen (up to 300 mg/kg) did not modify the seizures induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of pentylenetetrezol in mice (tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS). Acetaminophen (up to 150 micrograms/mL) did not retard the incorporation of radioactive adenosine into ATP in slices of rat cerebral cortex. Thus the mechanism by which acetaminophen antagonizes the actions of caffeine in the CNS remains unknown.
A patient who developed paraplegia following the intrathecal instillation of methotrexate is discribed. The ten previously reported cases of this unusual complication are reviewed. The following factors appear to predispose to the development of this complication: abnormal cerebrospinal dynamics related to the presence of central nervous system leukemia, and epidural cerebrospinal leakage; elevated cerebrospinal fluid methothexate concentration related to abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and to inappropriately high methotrexate doses based on body surface area calculations in older children and adults; the presence of neurotoxic preservatives in commercially available methotrexate preparations and diluents; and the use of methotrexate diluents of unphysiologic pH, ionic content and osmolarity. The role of methotrexate contaminants, local folate deficiency, and cranial irradiation in the pathogenesis of intrathecal methotrexate toxicity is unclear. The incidence of neurotoxicity may be reduced by employing lower doses of methotrexate in the presence of central nervous system leukemia, in older children and adults, and in the presence of epidural leakage. Only preservative-free methotrexate in Elliott's B Solution at a concentration of not more than 1 mg/ml should be used for intrathecal administration. Periodic monitoring of cerebruspinal fluid methotrexate levels may be predictive of the development of serious neurotoxicity.
A patient who received antithymocyte globulin therapy for aplastic anemia due to D-penicillamine therapy is described. Bone marrow recovery and peripheral blood recovery were complete 1 month and 3 months, respectively, after treatment, and blood transfusion or other therapies were not necessary in a follow-up period of more than 2 years. Use of antithymocyte globulin may be the optimal treatment of D-penicillamine-induced aplastic anemia.
A patient who received tocolysis with nifedipine developed neuromuscular blockade after 500 mg of magnesium sulfate was administered. This reaction demonstrates that nifedipine can seriously potentiate the toxicity of magnesium. Caution should be exercised when these two tocolytics are combined.
A patient with chronic renal failure (CRF) developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) after administration of risperidone and levomepromazine. In addition to the typical symptoms of NMS, massive intestinal bleeding was observed during the episode. This report suggests that NMS in a patient with CRF may be complicated by intestinal bleeding and needs special caution for this complication.
A patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis and disseminated sporotrichosis developed acute renal failure immediately following the administration of amphotericin B on four separate occasions. The abruptness of the renal failure and its reversibility within days suggests that there was a functional component to the renal dysfunction. We propose that amphotericin, in the setting of reduced effective arterial volume, may activate tubuloglomerular feedback, thereby contributing to acute renal failure.
A patient with renal disease developed Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia while receiving cephalothin therapy. An anti-cephalothin IgG antibody was detected in the patient's serum and in the eluates from her erythrocytes. In addition, nonimmunologic binding of normal and patient's serum proteins to her own and cephalothin-coated normal red cells was demonstrated. Skin tests and in vitro lymphocyte stimulation revealed that the patient was sensitized to cephalothin and also to ampicillin. Careful investigation of drug-induced hemolytic anemias reveals the complexity of the immune mechanisms involved.
A patient with sinuatrial disease and implanted pacemaker was treated with amiodarone (maximum dose 1000 mg, maintenance dose 800 mg daily) for 10 months, for control of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. He developed pneumonitis, pleural and pericardial effusions, and a predominantly proximal motor neuropathy. Immediate but gradual improvement followed withdrawal of amiodarone and treatment with prednisolone. Review of this and previously reported cases indicates the need for early diagnosis of amiodarone pneumonitis, immediate withdrawal of amiodarone, and prompt but continued steroid therapy to ensure full recovery.
A patient with sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block, induced by carbamazepine, prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases. From the analysis of these cases, two distinct forms of carbamazepine-associated cardiac dysfunction emerged. One patient group developed sinus tachycardias in the setting of a massive carbamazepine overdose. The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life-threatening bradyarrhythmias or atrioventricular conduction delay, associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated carbamazepine serum levels. Because carbamazepine is widely used in the treatment of many neurologic and psychiatric conditions, the recognition of the latter syndrome has important implications for the use of this drug in elderly patients.
A patient with transfusion-dependent thalassemia was undergoing home intravenous desferrioxamine (DFX) treatment by means of a totally implanted system because of his poor compliance with the nightly subcutaneous therapy. Due to an accidental malfunctioning of the infusion pump, the patient was inadvertently administered a toxic dosage of the drug which caused renal insufficiency. Given the progressive deterioration of the symptoms and of the laboratory values, despite adequate medical treatment, a decision was made to introduce haemodialytical therapy in order to remove the drug and therapy reduce the nephrotoxicity. From the results obtained, haemodialysis can therefore be suggested as a useful therapy in rare cases of progressive acute renal failure caused by desferrioxamine.

A phase III clinical trial assessed the recurrence of adenomatous polyps after treatment for 36 months with difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) plus sulindac or matched placebos. Temporary hearing loss is a known toxicity of treatment with DFMO, thus a comprehensive approach was developed to analyze serial air conduction audiograms. The generalized estimating equation method estimated the mean difference between treatment arms with regard to change in air conduction pure tone thresholds while accounting for within-subject correlation due to repeated measurements at frequencies. Based on 290 subjects, there was an average difference of 0.50 dB between subjects treated with DFMO plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo (95% confidence interval, -0.64 to 1.63 dB; P = 0.39), adjusted for baseline values, age, and frequencies. In the normal speech range of 500 to 3,000 Hz, an estimated difference of 0.99 dB (-0.17 to 2.14 dB; P = 0.09) was detected. Dose intensity did not add information to models. There were 14 of 151 (9.3%) in the DFMO plus sulindac group and 4 of 139 (2.9%) in the placebo group who experienced at least 15 dB hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested (P = 0.02). Follow-up air conduction done at least 6 months after end of treatment showed an adjusted mean difference in hearing thresholds of 1.08 dB (-0.81 to 2.96 dB; P = 0.26) between treatment arms. There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the DFMO plus sulindac group who experienced clinically significant hearing loss compared with the placebo group. The estimated attributable risk of ototoxicity from exposure to the drug is 8.4% (95% confidence interval, -2.0% to 18.8%; P = 0.12). There is a <2 dB difference in mean threshold for patients treated with DFMO plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo.

A population-based series of 54 male breast cancer cases from Southern California were analyzed for germ-line mutations in the inherited breast/ovarian cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Nine (17%) of the patients had a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer in at least one first-degree relative. A further seven (13%) of the patients reported breast/ovarian cancer in at least one second-degree relative and in no first-degree relatives. No germ-line BRCA1 mutations were found. Two male breast cancer patients (4% of the total) were found to carry novel truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Only one of the two male breast cancer patients carrying a BRCA2 mutation had a family history of cancer, with one case of ovarian cancer in a first-degree relative. The remaining eight cases (89%) of male breast cancer with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer in first-degree relatives remain unaccounted for by mutations in either the BRCA1 gene or the BRCA2 gene..
A population-based study of the clinical expression of the hemochromatosis gene.
A portion of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene transcript from human fetal skeletal muscle and mouse adult heart was sequenced, representing approximately 25 percent of the total, 14-kb DMD transcript. The nucleic acid and predicted amino acid sequences from the two species are nearly 90 percent homologous. The amino acid sequence that is predicted from this portion of the DMD gene indicates that the protein product might serve a structural role in muscle, but the abundance and tissue distribution of the messenger RNA suggests that the DMD protein is not nebulin..
A postmarketing surveillance study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of a fixed-ratio combination containing 10 mg of timolol maleate and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, administered twice daily for one month to hypertensive patients. Data on 9,037 patients were collected by 1,455 participating physicians. Mean systolic blood pressure decreased 25 mmHg and mean diastolic blood pressure declined 15 mmHg after one month of timolol-hydrochlorothiazide therapy (P less than 0.01, both comparisons). Age, race, and sex appeared to have no influence on the decrease in blood pressure. The antihypertensive effect of the drug was greater in patients with more severe hypertension. Overall, 1,453 patients experienced a total of 2,658 adverse events, the most common being fatigue, dizziness, and weakness. Treatment in 590 patients was discontinued because of adverse events.

A previous linkage study provided evidence for a prostate cancer-susceptibility locus at 1q24-25. Subsequent reports in additional collections of families have yielded conflicting results. In addition, evidence for locus heterogeneity has been provided by the identification of other putative hereditary prostate cancer loci on Xq27-28, 1q42-43, and 1p36. The present study describes a combined analysis for six markers in the 1q24-25 region in 772 families affected by hereditary prostate cancer and ascertained by the members of the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG) from North America, Australia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Overall, there was some evidence for linkage, with a peak parametric multipoint LOD score assuming heterogeneity (HLOD) of 1. 40 (P =. 01) at D1S212. The estimated proportion of families (alpha) linked to the locus was. 06 (1-LOD support interval. 01-. 12). This evidence was not observed by a nonparametric approach, presumably because of the extensive heterogeneity. Further parametric analysis revealed a significant effect of the presence of male-to-male disease transmission within the families. In the subset of 491 such families, the peak HLOD was 2. In the subset of 491 such families, the peak HLOD was 2. 56 (P =. 0006) and alpha =. 11 (1-LOD support interval. 04-. 19), compared with HLODs of 0 in the remaining 281 families. Within the families with male-to-male disease transmission, alpha increased with the early mean age at diagnosis (< 65 years, alpha =. 19, with 1-LOD support interval. 06-. 34) and the number of affected family members (five or more family members, alpha =. 15, with 1-LOD support interval. 04-. 28). The highest value of alpha was observed for the 48 families that met all three criteria (peak HLOD = 2. 25, P =. 001, alpha =. 29, with 1-LOD support interval. 08-. 53). These results support the finding of a prostate cancer-susceptibility gene linked to 1q24-25, albeit in a defined subset of prostate cancer families. Although HPC1 accounts for only a small proportion of all families affected by hereditary prostate cancer, it appears to play a more prominent role in the subset of families with several members affected at an early age and with male-to-male disease transmission.
A previously healthy 40-year-old man presenting with fever, arthritis, and cutaneous vasculitis was found to have chronic meningococcemia. Evaluation of his complement system showed an absence of functional and antigenic C7, compatible with a complete deficiency of the seventh component of complement. Study of the patients family spanning four generations showed heterozygous deficiency of C7 in five members. Chronic neisserial infection can be associated with C7 deficiency and must be distinguished from other causes of cutaneous vasculitis..
A previously undescribed mutation within the tetramerisation domain of TP53 in a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
A previously well 34-month-old male presenting with fever, skin rash, and arthralgias was found to lack C3 by immunochemical (undetectable) and hemolytic (1% normal) assays. No infectious agent could be demonstrated. Protein levels of Clq. C4, C5, properdin, and C3b-INA and hemolytic activities of complement components C1 to C9 except C3 were normal or elevated; total hemolytic complement activity was 13% of normal and was reconstituted by purified C3. Properdin factor B was 702 (normal 175 to 275) mug/ml, and was not cleaver upon addition of zymosan or cobra venom factor. The serum had normal immune adherence activity, but was deficient in ability to opsonize Candida albicans for uptake and Escherichia coli for killing by neurophils, generate neutrophil chemotactic factors and inhibit the growth of E. coli; these activities were restored by purified C3. A transfusion of 320 ml 1-hour-old normal whole blood on the fifty-second day resulted in transitory elevation of the C3 level to 25 mg/dl with a fall-off (approximately 2 1/2% per hour) to undetectable levels by 69 hours; it was followed by disappearance of the skin rash and arthralgias and return to normal of the previously elevated temperature and CRP levels. C3 levels in family members (seven of 24 half-normal), lack of anti-C3 activity, normal C3b-INA levels and a normal rate of catabolism of transfused C3 indicated that the deficiency was inherited with autosomal codominance and involved decreased synthesis of C3. Thus, this child is a unique individual with inherited C3 deficiency presenting with absence of repeated infections, whose symptoms of fever, skin rash, and arthralgia were abated by whole blood transfusion..
A probe for the 5 end of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene was used to study expression of the gene in normal human muscle, myogenic cell cultures, and muscle from patients with DMD. Expression was found in RNA from normal fetal muscle, adult cardiac and skeletal muscle, and cultured muscle after myoblast fusion. In DMD muscle, expression of this portion of the gene was also revealed by in situ RNA hybridization, particularly in regenerating muscle fibers..
A prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of vancomycin was conducted in 54 consecutive patients over a 16-month period. Vancomycin was curative in 95% of 43 patients with proven infection. Drugs were ceased in six patients because of adverse reactions; in three of these vancomycin was considered the likely cause. Reactions included thrombophlebitis (20 of 54 patients), rash (4 of 54), nephrotoxicity (4 of 50), proteinuria (1 of 50) and ototoxicity (1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry). Thrombophlebitis occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae; nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were confined to patients receiving an aminoglycoside plus vancomycin. We conclude that vancomycin, administered appropriately, constitutes safe, effective therapy for infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

A prospective, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the role of vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation in preventing zidovudine (ZDV)-induced bone marrow suppression. Seventy-five human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts < 500/mm3 were randomized to receive either ZDV (500 mg daily) alone (group I, n = 38) or in combination with folinic acid (15 mg daily) and intramascular vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms monthly) (group II, n = 37). Finally, 15 patients were excluded from the study (noncompliance 14, death 1); thus, 60 patients (31 in group I and 29 in group II) were eligible for analysis. No significant differences between groups were found at enrollment. During the study, vitamin B12 and folate levels were significantly higher in group II patients; however, no differences in hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, and white-cell, neutrophil and platelet counts were observed between groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Severe hematologic toxicity (neutrophil count < 1000/mm3 and/or hemoglobin < 8 g/dl) occurred in 4 patients assigned to group I and 7 assigned to group II. There was no correlation between vitamin B12 or folate levels and development of myelosuppression. Vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation of ZDV therapy does not seem useful in preventing or reducing ZDV-induced myelotoxicity in the overall treated population, although a beneficial effect in certain subgroups of patients cannot be excluded.
A prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study to compare the results of stereotactic unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) refractory to medical treatment was designed. Ten consecutive patients (mean age, 58.4 +/- 6.8 years; 7 men, 3 women) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease (mean disease time, 8.4 +/- 3.5 years), disabling motor fluctuations (Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3-5 in off-drug phases) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias were selected. All patients had bilateral symptoms and their levodopa equivalent dosing were analysed. Six patients were operated on in the globus pallidus interna (GPi) and four in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Clinical evaluation included the use of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn_Yahr score and Schwab England activities of daily living (ADL) score in 'on'- and 'off'-drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery. There was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major parkinsonian motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months. Levodopa equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the STN group. Changes in UPDRS, Hoehn _ Yahr and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups. Cognitive functions were unchanged in both groups. Complications were observed in two patients: one had a left homonymous hemianopsia after pallidotomy and another one developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy which partly improved within 1 month with Valproate 1000 mg/day. The findings of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral STN and GPi are equally effective treatment for patients with advanced PD refractory to medical treatment.

A rare case of morbid vasospasm, together with striking angiographic findings, is described secondary to the ingestion of methysergide by a 48-year-old woman. A brief review of the literature on similar cases is presented. A discussion of the history of ergot includes its original discovery, the epidemics of gangrene that it has caused through the ages and its past and present role in the management of migraine headache. Despite the advent of calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic antagonists, ergot preparations continue to play a major role in migraine therapy, so that the danger of St. Anthony's fire persists.
A rat model was used to evaluate the general acute toxicity and the late cardiotoxicity of 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (DOX) given either as free drug or in the form of three N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer conjugates. In these HPMA copolymers, DOX was covalently bound via peptide linkages that were either non-biodegradable (Gly-Gly) or degradable by lysosomal proteinases (Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly). In addition, one biodegradable conjugate containing galactosamine was used; this residue was targeted to the liver. Over the first 3 weeks after the i.v. administration of free and polymer-bound DOX, all animals showed a transient reduction in body weight. However, the maximal reduction in body weight seen in animals that received polymer-bound DOX (4 mg/kg) was significantly lower than that observed in those that received free DOX (4 mg/kg) or a mixture of the unmodified parent HPMA copolymer and free DOX (4 mg/kg; P less than 0.01). Throughout the study (20 weeks), deaths related to cardiotoxicity were observed only in animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX; in these cases, histological investigations revealed marked changes in the heart that were consistent with DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Sequential measurements of cardiac output in surviving animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX showed a reduction of approximately 30% in function beginning at the 4th week after drug administration. The heart rate in these animals was approximately 12% lower than that measured in age-matched control rats (P less than 0.05). Animals that were given the HPMA copolymer conjugates containing DOX exhibited no significant change in cardiac output throughout the study (P less than 0.05). In addition, no significant histological change was observed in the heart of animals that received DOX in the form of HPMA copolymer conjugates and were killed at the end of the study. However, these animals had shown a significant increase in heart rate beginning at 8 weeks after drug administration (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
A recently described protein, metaxin 1, serves as a component of a preprotein import complex in the outer membrane of the mammalian mitochondrion. A yeast two-hybrid screen with metaxin 1 as bait has now identified a novel protein, which we have termed metaxin 2, as a metaxin 1-binding protein. Metaxin 2 shares 29% identity with metaxin 1 at the amino acid level, but metaxin 2, unlike metaxin 1, lacks a C-terminal mitochondrial outer membrane signal-anchor domain. Two C. elegans hypothetical proteins, CelZC97.1 and CelF39B2.i, share high sequence similarity with metaxin 2 and metaxin 1, respectively, and likely represent the C. elegans orthologs. Affinity-purified antibodies against metaxin 2 were prepared against the recombinant protein produced in E. coli and were used to analyze the subcellular distribution of metaxin 2. In subcellular fractions of mouse liver, a 29 kD immunoreactive protein, consistent in size with the predicted translation product of metaxin 2 cDNA, was found solely in mitochondria. Alkali extraction of mitochondria indicated that metaxin 2 is peripherally associated with mitochondrial membranes. Metaxin 2 in intact mitochondria was susceptible to digestion with proteinase K, indicating that metaxin 2 is located on the cytosolic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Finally, baculoviruses encoding a His6-tagged metaxin 2 and an untagged metaxin 1 lacking its C-terminal transmembrane domain were produced and used separately or in combination to infect Sf21 insect cells. Metaxin 1 bound to a Ni2+-chelate affinity column only in the presence of metaxin 2, indicating that metaxin 1 and metaxin 2 interact when overexpressed in insect cells. These results suggest that metaxin 2 is bound to the cytosolic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane by means of its interaction with membrane-bound metaxin 1, and that this complex may play a role in protein import into mammalian mitochondria.
A recently identified membrane-type 6 matrix metalloproteinase (MT6-MMP) has a hydrophobic stretch of 24 amino acids at the C-terminus. This hydrophobicity pattern is similar to glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored MMP, MT4-MMP, and other GPI-anchored proteins. Thus, we tested the possibility that MT6-MMP was also a GPI-anchored proteinase. Our results showed that MT6-MMP as well as MT4-MMP were labeled with ethanolamine indicating the presence of a GPI unit with incorporated label. In addition, phosphatidyl inositol-specific phospholipase C treatment released MT6-MMP from the surface of transfected cells. These results strongly indicate that MT6-MMP is a GPI-anchored protein. Since two members of MT-MMPs are now assigned as GPI-anchored proteinase, MT-MMPs can be subgrouped into GPI type and transmembrane type.
A recognized feature of psoriasis and other proliferative dermatoses is accumulation in the skin of the unusual arachidonic acid metabolite, 12R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12R-HETE). This hydroxy fatty acid is opposite in chirality to the product of the well-known 12S-lipoxygenase and heretofore in mammals is known only as a product of cytochrome P450s. Here we provide mechanistic evidence for a lipoxygenase route to 12R-HETE in human psoriatic tissue and describe a 12R-lipoxygenase that can account for the biosynthesis. Initially we demonstrated retention of the C-12 deuterium of octadeuterated arachidonic acid in its conversion to 12R-HETE in incubations of psoriatic scales, indicating the end product is not formed by isomerization from 12S-H(P)ETE via the 12-keto derivative. Secondly, analysis of product formed from and -labeled arachidonic acids revealed that 12R-HETE synthesis is associated with stereospecific removal of the pro-R hydrogen from the 10-carbon of arachidonate. This result is compatible with 12R-lipoxygenase-catalyzed formation of 12R-HETE and not with a P450-catalyzed route to 12R-HETE in psoriatic scales. We cloned a lipoxygenase from human keratinocytes; the cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences share 98% 12R in configuration. The 12R-lipoxygenase cDNA is detectable by PCR in psoriatic scales and as a 2.5-kilobase mRNA by Northern analysis of keratinocytes. Identification of this enzyme extends the known distribution of R-lipoxygenases to humans and presents an additional target for potential therapeutic interventions in psoriasis.
A recurrent expansion of a maternal allele with 36 CAG repeats causes Huntington disease in two sisters.
A relatively high frequency of germ-line genomic rearrangements in MLH1 and MSH2 has been reported among Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC) patients from different ethnic populations. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we characterized the DNA breakpoints of 11 germ-line deletions, six for MLH1 and five for MSH2. Distinct deletion patterns were found for the two genes. The five cases of MSH2 deletions result exclusively from intragenic unequal recombination mediated by repetitive Alu sequences. In contrast, five out of the six MLH1 deletions are due to recombinations involving sequences of no significant homology (P=0.015). A detailed analysis of the DNA breakpoints in the two genes, previously characterized by other groups, validated the observation that Alu-mediated unequal recombination is the main type of deletion in MSH2 (n=34), but not in MLH1 (n=21) (P<0.0001). Plotting the distribution of known DNA breakpoints among the introns of the two genes showed that, the highest breakpoint density is co-localized with the highest Alu density. Our study suggests that Alu is a promoting factor for the genomic recombinations in both MLH1 and MSH2, and the local Alu density may be involved in shaping the deletion pattern.
A report is given on an 83-year-old female who acquired central vein thrombosis in her seeing eye one day after having started topical medication with dipivalyl epinephrine for advanced glaucoma discovered in the other eye. From present knowledge about the effects of adrenergic eye drops on ocular blood circulation, it is difficult to suggest an association between the two events, which may be coincidental only.
A reproducible model for producing diffuse myocardial injury (epinephrine infusion) has been developed to study the cardioprotective effects of agents or maneuvers which might alter the evolution of acute myocardial infarction. Infusions of epinephrine (4 mug per kilogram per minute for 6 hours) increased radiocalcium uptakes into intact myocardium and each of its subcellular components with the mitochondrial fraction showing the most consistent changes when compared to saline-infused control animals (4,957 vs. 827 counts per minute per gram of dried tissue or fraction). Myocardial concentrations of calcium also increased significantly (12.0 vs. 5.0 mg.per 100 Gm. of fat-free dry weight). Infusions of calcium chloride sufficient to raise serum calcium concentrations 2 mEq. per liter failed to increase calcium influx into the myocardial cell. Mitochondrial radiocalcium uptakes were significantly decreased in animals pretreated with acetylsalicylic acid or dipyridamole or when hydrocortisone was added to the epinephrine infusion (2,682,2,803, and 3,424 counts per minute per gram of dried fraction, respectively). Myocardial calcium concentrations also were decreased (11.2, 8.3, and 8.9 mg. per 100 Gm. of fat-free dry weight, respectively) in the three treatment groups, being significantly decreased only in the last two. Evidence of microscopic damage was graded as less severe in the three treatment groups. Acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, and hydrocortisone all appear to have cardioprotective effects when tested in this model.
A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985. Laitinen's procedure improved most symptoms in drug-resistant PD, which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community. Another lesioning procedure, ventrolateral thalamotomy, has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius, producing high long-term success rates and low morbidity rates. Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success. According to the literature pallidotomy improves the "on" symptoms of PD, such as dyskinesias, as well as the "off" symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and on-off fluctuations. Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Stimulation often produces an improvement in the hyper- or dyskinetic upper limbs, but increases the "freezing" phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time. Considering the small increase in the patient's independence, the high costs of bilateral implants, and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices, the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy.
A retrospective anonymous pilot study in screening newborns for HFE mutations in Scandinavian populations.
A retrospective, case-controlled analysis comparing patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit with severe exacerbations of asthma who received continuously nebulized albuterol (CNA) versus intermittent albuterol (INA) treatments is reported. Forty matched pairs of patients with asthma are compared. CNA was administered for a mean of 11 +/- 10 hr. The incidence of cardiac dysrhythmias was similar between groups. Symptomatic hypokalemia did not occur. CNA patients had higher heart rates during treatment, which may reflect severity of illness. The incidence of intubation was similar. We conclude that CNA and INA demonstrated similar profiles with regard to safety, morbidity, and mortality.
A reversible toxic liver damage was observed in a non-alcoholic woman treated with disulfiram. The causative relationship was proven by challenge.
A role for nerve growth factor (NGF) in contributing to increased voiding frequency and altered sensation from the urinary bladder has been suggested. Previous studies have examined the expression and regulation of tyrosine kinase receptors (Trks) in micturition reflexes with urinary bladder inflammation. The present studies examine the expression and regulation of another receptor known to bind NGF, p75(NTR), after various durations of bladder inflammation induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP). CYP-induced cystitis increased (P < or = 0.001) p75(NTR) expression in the superficial lateral and medial dorsal horn in L1-L2 and L6-S1 spinal segments. The number of p75(NTR)-immunoreactive (-IR) cells in the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) also increased (P < or = 0.05) with CYP-induced cystitis (acute, intermediate, and chronic). Quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction also demonstrated significant increases (P < or = 0.01) in p75(NTR) mRNA in DRG with intermediate and chronic CYP-induced cystitis. Retrograde dye-tracing techniques with Fastblue were used to identify presumptive bladder afferent cells in the lumbosacral DRG. In bladder afferent cells in DRG, p75(NTR)-IR was also increased (P < or = 0.01) with cystitis. In addition to increases in p75(NTR)-IR in DRG cell bodies, increases (P < or = 0.001) in pericellular (encircling DRG cells) p75(NTR)-IR in DRG also increased. Confocal analyses demonstrated that pericellular p75(NTR)-IR was not colocalized with the glial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These studies demonstrate that p75(NTR) expression in micturition reflexes is present constitutively and modified by bladder inflammation. The functional significance of p75(NTR) expression in micturition reflexes remains to be determined.
A search of the yeast data base for a protein homologous to Escherichia coli UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase yielded UAP1 (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase), the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase. The Candida albicans and human homologs were also cloned by screening a C. albicans genomic library and a human testis cDNA library, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that the human UAP1 cDNA was identical to previously reported AGX1. A null mutation of the S. cerevisiae UAP1 (ScUAP1) gene was lethal, and when expressed under the control of ScUAP1 promoter, both C. albicans and Homo sapiens UAP1 (CaUAP1 and HsUAP1) rescued the ScUAP1-deficient S. cerevisiae cells. All the recombinant ScUap1p, CaUap1p, and HsUap1p possessed UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase activities in vitro. The yeast Uap1p utilized N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate as the substrate, and together with Agm1p, it produced UDP-N-acetylglucosamine from N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate. These results demonstrate that the UAP1 genes indeed specify eukaryotic UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase and that phosphomutase reaction precedes uridyltransfer. Sequence comparison with other UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases revealed that amino acid residues, Gly112, Gly114, Thr115, Arg116, Pro122, and Lys123 of ScUap1p are highly conserved in UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases reported to date. Among these amino acids, alanine substitution for Gly112, Arg116, or Lys123 severely diminished the activity, suggesting that Gly112, Arg116, or Lys123 are possible catalytic residues of the enzyme.
A second isoform of the human vesicular monoamine transporter (hVMAT) has been cloned from a pheochromocytoma cDNA library. The contribution of the two transporter isoforms to monoamine storage in human neuroendocrine tissues was examined with isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies against hVMAT1 and hVMAT2. Central, peripheral, and enteric neurons express only VMAT2. VMAT1 is expressed exclusively in neuroendocrine, including chromaffin and enterochromaffin, cells. VMAT1 and VMAT2 are coexpressed in all chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. VMAT2 alone is expressed in histamine-storing enterochromaffin-like cells of the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach. The transport characteristics and pharmacology of each VMAT isoform have been directly compared after expression in digitonin-permeabilized fibroblastic (CV-1) cells, providing information about substrate feature recognition by each transporter and the role of vesicular monoamine storage in the mechanism of action of psychopharmacologic and neurotoxic agents in human. Serotonin has a similar affinity for both transporters. Catecholamines exhibit a 3-fold higher affinity, and histamine exhibits a 30-fold higher affinity, for VMAT2. Reserpine and ketanserin are slightly more potent inhibitors of VMAT2-mediated transport than of VMAT1-mediated transport, whereas tetrabenazine binds to and inhibits only VMAT2. N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, phenylethylamine, amphetamine, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine are all more potent inhibitors of VMAT2 than of VMAT1, whereas fenfluramine is a more potent inhibitor of VMAT1-mediated monamine transport than of VMAT2-mediated monoamine transport. The unique distributions of hVMAT1 and hVMAT2 provide new markers for multiple neuroendocrine lineages, and examination of their transport properties provides mechanistic insights into the pharmacology and physiology of amine storage in cardiovascular, endocrine, and central nervous system function.
A selective dopamine D4 receptor antagonist, NRA0160: a preclinical neuropharmacological profile.
A series of N-pyrimidinyl-2-phenoxyacetamide adenosine A(2A) antagonists is described. SAR studies led to compound 14 with excellent potency (K(i) = 0.4 nM), selectivity (A(1)/A(2A) > 100), and efficacy (MED 10 mg/kg p.o.) in the rat haloperidol-induced catalepsy model for Parkinson's disease.
A set of 11 clones encoding putative GTP binding proteins highly homologous to the yeast YPT1/SEC4 gene products have been isolated from an MDCK cell cDNA library. We localized three of the corresponding proteins in mammalian cells by using affinity-purified antibodies in immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy studies. One, the MDCK homolog of rab2, is associated with a structure having the characteristics of an intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The second, rab5, is located at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane and on early endosomes, while the third, rab7, is found on late endosomes. These findings provide evidence that members of the YPT1/SEC4 subfamily of GTP binding proteins are localized to specific exocytic and endocytic subcompartments in mammalian cells.
A seventy-eight-year-old woman presented with complete heart block and refractory hypotension two days after a therapeutic dose of sustained-release verapamil with concomitant use of metoprolol. The patient continued to remain hypotensive with complete heart block, even with multiple uses of intravenous atropine as well as high doses of pressor agents such as dopamine and dobutamine. However, shortly after the use of intravenous calcium chloride, the refractory hypotension and complete heart block resolved.
A single amino acid substitution (G103D) in the type II collagen triple helix produces Kniest dysplasia.
A single dose of valproic acid (VPA), which is a widely used antiepileptic drug, is associated with oxidative stress in rats, as recently demonstrated by elevated levels of 15-F(2t)-isoprostane (15-F(2t)-IsoP). To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between VPA-associated oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated ip with VPA (500 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline (vehicle) once daily for 2, 4, 7, 10, or 14 days. Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of 15-F(2t)-IsoP, lipid hydroperoxides (LPO), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs). Plasma and liver 15-F(2t)-IsoP were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of VPA treatment compared to control. Liver LPO levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment (1.8-fold versus control, p < 0.05). Liver and plasma TBARs were not increased until 14 days (2-fold vs. control, p < 0.05). Liver toxicity was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) and by histology. Serum alpha-GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4, which corresponded to hepatotoxicity as shown by the increasing incidence of inflammation of the liver capsule, necrosis, and steatosis throughout the study. The liver levels of beta-oxidation metabolites of VPA were decreased by day 14, while the levels of 4-ene-VPA and (E)-2,4-diene-VPA were not elevated throughout the study. Overall, these findings indicate that VPA treatment results in oxidative stress, as measured by levels of 15-F(2t)-IsoP, which precedes the onset of necrosis, steatosis, and elevated levels of serum alpha-GST.
A single neurotoxic dose of methamphetamine induces a long-lasting depressive-like behaviour in mice.
A single origin of phenylketonuria in Yemenite Jews.
A sixty-year-old woman with advanced breast cancer, previously treated with cisplatin, developed an irreversible lethal renal failure with anuria, the day after 5 g/m2 bolus ifosfamide. Postrenal failure was excluded by echography. A prerenal component could have contributed to renal failure because of a transient hypotension, due to an increasing ascitis, occurring just before anuria. However, correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function. Ifosfamide is a known nephrotoxic drug with demonstrated tubulopathies. We strongly suspect that this lethal anuria was mainly due to ifosfamide, occurring in a patient having received previous cisplatin chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient hypotension. We recommend careful use of ifosfamide in patients pretreated with nephrotoxic chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion.
A small-for-gestational-age infant, found to have analbuminemia in the neonatal period, is reported and the twelve cases recorded in the world literature are reviewed. Patients lacking this serum protein are essentially asymptomatic, apart from minimal ankle edema and ease of fatigue. Apparent compensatory mechanisms which come into play when serum albumin is low include prolonged half-life of albumin and transferrin, an increase in serum globulins, beta lipoprotein, and glycoproteins, arterial hypotension with reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure, and the ability to respond with rapid sodium and chloride diuresis in response to small volume changes. Examination of plasma amino acids, an investigation not previously reported, revealed an extremely low plasma tryptophan level, a finding which may be important in view of the role of tryptophan in albumin synthesis..
A soluble class II cytokine receptor, IL-22RA2, is a naturally occurring IL-22 antagonist.
A somatic mutation in the X linked PIGA gene is responsible for the deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored proteins on blood cells from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. No inherited form of GPI-anchor deficiency has been described. Because conventional Piga gene knockout is associated with high embryonic lethality in chimeric mice, we used the Cre/loxP system. We generated mice in which two loxP sites flank part of Piga exon 2. After crossbreeding with female mice of the EIIa-cre strain, the floxed allele undergoes Cre-mediated recombination with high efficiency during early embryonic development. Because of X chromosome inactivation, female offspring are mosaic for cells that express or lack GPI-linked proteins. Analysis of mosaic mice showed that in heart, lung, kidney, brain, and liver, mainly wild-type Piga is active, suggesting that these tissues require GPI-linked proteins. The salient exceptions were spleen, thymus, and red blood cells, which had almost equal numbers of cells expressing the wild-type or the recombined allele, implying that GPI-linked proteins are not essential for the derivation of these tissues. PIGA (-) cells had no growth advantage, suggesting that other factors are needed for their clonal dominance in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria..

A striking organization of a large family of human neural cadherin-like cell adhesion genes.
A strong candidate for the 17q-linked BRCA1 gene, which influences susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer, has been identified by positional cloning methods. Probable predisposing mutations have been detected in five of eight kindreds presumed to segregate BRCA1 susceptibility alleles. The mutations include an 11-base pair deletion, a 1-base pair insertion, a stop codon, a missense substitution, and an inferred regulatory mutation. The BRCA1 gene is expressed in numerous tissues, including breast and ovary, and encodes a predicted protein of 1863 amino acids. This protein contains a zinc finger domain in its amino-terminal region, but is otherwise unrelated to previously described proteins. Identification of BRCA1 should facilitate early diagnosis of breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility in some individuals as well as a better understanding of breast cancer biology..
A strong candidate for the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1.
A study of Danish probands with primary torsion dystonia is presented. The probands were examined clinically and biochemically to exclude secondary dystonia. Mutation analyses for the GAG-deletion in the DYT1 gene were performed on 107 probands; and the mutation was detected in three. All three probands had the classical phenotype of DYT1-dystonia, but only one had a family history of dystonia. The other two probands had, obviously, sporadic DYT1-dystonia, one of which was caused by a de novo mutation, while the other one had a parent being an asymptomatic carrier. De novo mutations in the DYT1 gene are seldom reported although independent founder mutations are known to have occurred. The frequency of DYT1-dystonia was low in our study even though several probands had early onset generalised dystonia. None of the probands in our study with other types of dystonia had the GAG-deletion as reported in other studies. The difficulties in genetic counselling concerning the heterogeneity of dystonia exemplified by DYT1-dystonia are outlined.
A study on the effect of the duration of subcutaneous heparin injection on bruising and pain.
A study was undertaken to characterize the mutation (s) responsible for Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) in a Cajun population in southwest Louisiana and to identify the origins of these mutations. Eleven of 12 infantile TSD alleles examined in six families had the beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) alpha-subunit exon 11 insertion mutation that is present in approximately 70% of Ashkenazi Jewish TSD heterozygotes. The mutation in the remaining allele was a single-base transition in the donor splice site of the alpha-subunit intron 9. To determine the origins of these two mutations in the Cajun population, the TSD carrier status was enzymatically determined for 90 members of four of the six families, and extensive pedigrees were constructed for all carriers. A single ancestral couple from France was found to be common to most of the carriers of the exon 11 insertion. Pedigree data suggest that this mutation has been in the Cajun population since its founding over 2 centuries ago and that it may be widely distributed within the population. In contrast, the intron 9 mutation apparently was introduced within the last century and probably is limited to a few Louisiana families..
A survey instrument is used to assess temperature regulation characteristics in children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) compared to 3 control groups sibs of PWS patients (SIB), neurodevelopmentally handicapped children (ND), and age and gender matched well children (WC). Significant differences were found between PWS patients, SIB controls, and WC controls in the prevalence of febrile convulsions, fever-associated symptoms, and temperature less than 94 degrees F. No differences were noted in any variable between the PWS patients and the ND controls, suggesting that these abnormalities are not unique to PWS, but can occur in any neurodevelopmentally handicapped individual, further suggesting these do not necessarily reflect syndrome-specific hypothalamic abnormalities..
A susceptibility gene for hereditary breast-ovarian cancer, BRCA1, has been assigned by linkage analysis to chromosome 17q21. Candidate genes in this region include EDH17B2, which encodes estradiol 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase II (17 beta-HSD II), and RARA, the gene for retinoic acid receptor alpha. We have typed 22 breast and breast-ovarian cancer families with eight polymorphisms from the chromosome 17q12-21 region, including two in the EDH17B2 gene. Genetic recombination with the breast cancer trait excludes RARA from further consideration as a candidate gene for BRCA1. Both BRCA1 and EDH17B2 map to a 6 cM interval (between THRA1 and D17S579) and no recombination was observed between the two genes. However, direct sequencing of overlapping PCR products containing the entire EDH17B2 gene in four unrelated affected women did not uncover any sequence variation, other than previously described polymorphisms. Mutations in the EDH17B2 gene, therefore do not appear to be responsible for the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome. Single meiotic crossovers in affected women suggest that BRCA1 is flanked by the loci RARA and D17S78..
A susceptibility gene on chromosome 18 and a parent-of-origin effect have been suggested for bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). We have studied 28 nuclear families selected for apparent unilineal transmission of the BPAD phenotype, by using 31 polymorphic markers spanning chromosome 18. Evidence for linkage was tested with affected-sib-pair and LOD score methods under two definitions of the affected phenotype. The affected-sibpair analyses indicated excess allele sharing for markers on 18p within the region reported previously. The greatest sharing was at D18S37 64% in bipolar and recurrent unipolar (RUP) sib pairs (P =. 0006). In addition, excess sharing of the paternally, but not maternally, transmitted alleles was observed at three markers on 18q at D18S41, 51 bipolar and RUP sib pairs were concordant for paternally transmitted alleles, and 21 pairs were discordant (P = 0004). The evidence for linkage to loci on both 18p and 18q was strongest in the 11 paternal pedigrees, i. e e., those in which the father or one of the fathers sibs is affected. In these pedigrees, the greatest allele sharing (81%; P =. 00002) and the highest LOD score (3. 51; phi = 0. 0) were observed at D18S41. Our results provide further support for linkage of BPAD to chromosome 18 and the first molecular evidence for a parent-of-origin effect operating in this disorder. The number of loci involved, and their precise location, require further study
A syndrome of microcephaly, progressive postnatal growth deficiency, and mental retardation was observed in two brothers and their cousin from a multiply consanguineous kindred of Lebanese descent. Hypotonia, chorioretinal dystrophy, and myopia were also identified. The severity of the condition varied among the closely related patients. Because of absence of a distinctive facial appearance, the degree of mental retardation, and short stature, the initially considered clinical diagnosis of Cohen syndrome was withdrawn and a novel genetic entity was assumed. Homozygosity mapping in this family assigned the gene to a 26. 8-cM region on the chromosome band 8q21. 3 -22. 1, between the microsatellites at D8S270 and D8S514. The maximum two-point LOD score was found for marker at D8S267 (Zmax = 3.. 237 at Omax = 0. 00). Intriguingly enough, the identified gene region overlaps the refined gene region for Cohen syndrome (COH1) [Kolehmainen et al., 1997 Euro J Hum Genet 5 206-213]. This fact encourages the hypothesis that the described kindred segregates for a variant of Cohen syndrome and suggests a redefinition of its phenotype
A synergistic effect of etoposide and cyclosporin A was observed in a patient with acute T-lymphocytic leukemia in relapse. The concomitant administration of etoposide and cyclosporin A resulted in eradication of hitherto refractory leukemic infiltration of bone marrow. Severe side effects in terms of mental confusion and progressive hyperbilirubinemia, however, point to an enhancement not only of antineoplastic effects but also of toxicity in normal tissues. This report demonstrates for the first time that the pharmacodynamic properties of cyclosporin A may not be confined strictly to suppression of normal T-cell functions.
A systematic search of the nonrecombining region of the human Y chromosome (NRY) identified 12 novel genes or families, 10 with full-length complementary DNA sequences. All 12 genes, and six of eight NRY genes or families previously isolated by less systematic means, fell into two classes. Genes in the first group were expressed in many organs; these housekeeping genes have X homologs that escape X inactivation. The second group, consisting of Y-chromosomal gene families expressed specifically in testes, may account for infertility among men with Y deletions. The coherence of the NRY's gene content contrasts with the apparently haphazard content of most eukaryotic chromosomes.
A technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with ketamine was used successfully during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in north Uganda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients, aged from 6 weeks to 70 years, undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including caesarian sections and interventions in neonates. Operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air/oxygen only. After premedication with diazepam, glycopyrrolate and local anaesthesia, and induction with standard doses of ketamine, a maintenance dose of 10-20 microg/kg/min of ketamine proved safe and effective. Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring, relying heavily on the heart rate. Diazepam, unless contraindicated or risky, remains the only necessary complementary drug to ketamine as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative hallucinations. Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative analgesia. An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h, glycopyrrolate being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects, especially in a hot climate. Experience in war/tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life-saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where, e.g. amputation and rapid extrication were required.
A temperature-sensitive mutation was obtained in Med6p, a component of the mediator complex from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mediator complex has been shown to enable transcriptional activation in vitro. This mutation in Med6p abolished activation of transcription from four of five inducible promoters tested in vivo. There was no effect, however, on uninduced transcription, transcription of constitutively expressed genes, or transcription by RNA polymerases I and III. Mediator-RNA polymerase II complex isolated from the mutant yeast strain was temperature sensitive for transcriptional activation in a reconstituted in vitro system due to a defect in initiation complex formation. A database search revealed the existence of MED6-related genes in humans and Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that the role of mediator in transcriptional activation is conserved throughout the evolution.

A total of 261 adverse ocular reactions occurred in 237 patients who received isotretinoin, a commonly used drug in the treatment of severe cystic acne. Blepharoconjunctivitis, subjective complaints of dry eyes, blurred vision, contact lens intolerance, and photodermatitis are reversible side effects. More serious ocular adverse reactions include papilledema, pseudotumor cerebri, and white or gray subepithelial corneal opacities; all of these are reversible if the drug is discontinued. Reported cases of decreased dark adaptation are under investigation. Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy because of the many reported congenital abnormalities after maternal use (including microphthalmos, orbital hypertelorism, and optic nerve hypoplasia).
A total of 3000 men living in Yamaguchi were screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency using Beutlers spot test and three types of starch gel electrophoresis. These electrophoresis used a phosphate buffer system at pH 7. 0, a TRIS-EDTA-borate buffer system at pH 8. 6, and a TRIS-hydrochloride buffer system at pH 8.. Fifteen G6PD-deficient variants were found at the rate of 0. 5% and classified into four groups. As new variants, G6PD Konan, Kamiube, and Kiwa were identified. These three variants had a mild to moderate G6PD deficiency and were not associated with any clinical signs. G6PD Konan had fast electrophoretic mobility as compared with normal levels, G6PD Kiwa had slightly elevated electrophoretic mobility, and G6PD Kamiube had normal electrophoretic mobility. These three variants had normal levels of Km G6P, Km NADP, and Ki NADPH, normal utilizations of both 2-deoxy-G6P and deamino-NAPD, normal heat stability, and a normal pH curve. The other variant was G6PD Ube, which we had previously found in Yamaguchi (Nakashima et al., 1977). One boy with G6PD Ube was Korean
A total of 362 males from various regions of Papua New Guinea were screened for red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity. Twenty-six G6PD deficient individuals were identified. Biochemical characterization of G6PD purified from these subjects has revealed 13 new variants and several copies of previously described forms of G6PD. This study illustrates the extreme heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency among the people of Papua New Guinea..
A total of 63 families with Huntington disease (HD) were examined for linkage between HD and G8 (D4S10). The families included 57 Caucasian, four Black American, and two Japanese. The combined maximum lod score was 87. 69 at theta = 0. 04 (99% confidence interval 0. 018-0. 071). The maximum frequency of recombination was 0. 03 in males and 0. 05 in females. Fifty-seven families gave positive lod scores; five small families gave mildly negative lod scores. The maximum likelihood estimate of alpha, the proportion of linked loci, was 1. 0 with a lower 99% confidence interval of 0. 88. These data suggest that there is only one HD locus, although a second rare locus cannot be ruled out.
A total of 630 haplotypes for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene locus were established in five groups of Polynesians comprising Samoans, Tongans, Cook Islanders, Maori, and Niueans. Considerable genetic continuity was demonstrated between these widely dispersed populations, since three common haplotypes (4, 1, and 7) constituted over 95% of alleles. A control group of individuals from Southeast Asia shared the same major haplotypes, 4, 1, and 7, with Polynesians. These data provide further support for the theories of genetic homogeneity and of Asian affinities of the Polynesian precursor populations. The absence of severe phenylketonuria (PKU) in both Polynesians and Southeast Asians is consistent with the lack of PAH haplotypes 2 and 3, on which the severe PKU mutants have arisen among Caucasians..
A total of five Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) patient with a 4p16.3 de novo microdeletion was referred because of genotype-phenotype inconsistencies, first explained as phenotypic variability of the WHS. The actual deletion size was found to be about 12 Mb in three patients, 5 Mb in another one and 20 Mb in the last one, leading us to hypothesize the presence of an extrachromosome segment on the deleted 4p. A der(4)(4qter --> p16.1::8p23 --> pter) chromosome, resulting from an unbalanced de novo translocation was, in fact, detected in four patients and a der(4)(4qter --> q32::4p15.3 --> qter) in the last. Unbalanced t(4;8) translocations were maternal in origin, the rec(4p;4q) was paternal. With the purpose of verifying frequency and specificity of this phenomenon, we investigated yet another group of 20 WHS patients with de novo large deletions (n = 13) or microdeletions (n = 7) and with apparently straightforward genotype-phenotype correlations. The rearrangement was paternal in origin, and occurred as a single anomaly in 19 out of 20 patients. In the remaining patient, the deleted chromosome 4 was maternally derived and consisted of a der(4)(4qter --> 4p16.3::8p23 --> 8pter). In conclusions, we observed that 20% (5/25) of de novo WHS-associated rearrangements were maternal in origin and 80% (20/25) were paternal. All the maternally derived rearrangements were de novo unbalanced t(4;8) translocations and showed specific clinical phenotypes. Paternally derived rearrangements were usually isolated deletions. It can be inferred that a double, cryptic chromosome imbalance is an important factor for phenotypic variability in WHS. It acts either by masking the actual deletion size or by doubling a quantitative change of the genome.
A total of sixty patients were trated with bromperidol first in open conditions (20 patients), then on a double blind basis (40 patients) with haloperidol as the reference substance. The open study lasted for four weeks; the drug was administrated in the form of 1 mg tablets. The daily dose (initial dose: 1 mg; mean dose at the end of the trial: 4.47 mg) was always administered in one single dose. Nineteen patients finished the trial, and in 18 cases the therapeutic result was considered very good to good. These results were confirmed by statistical analysis. Nine patients exhibited mild to moderate extrapyramidal concomitant symptoms; no other side effects were observed. The results of detailed laboratory tests and evaluations of various quantitative and qualitative tolerability parameters were not indicative of toxic effects. In the double blind study with haloperidol, both substances were found to be highly effective in the treatment of psychotic syndromes belonging predominantly to the schizophrenia group. Certain clues, including the onset of action, seem to be indicative of the superiority of bromperidol. No differences were observed with respect to side effects and general tolerability.

A variety of abnormal sensory/motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical (electrode implants) and DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of cocaine. The electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations. Cocaine (40 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg/kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study. Cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group, especially the electrically perturbated subjects. The abnormal behaviors were yawning, retrocollis, hyperactivity, hypersensitivity, "beating drum" behavior, squealing, head bobbing, circling, sniffing, abnormal posturing, and facial twitching. Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states. Hypersensitivity to various auditory, tactile, and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation. These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation. Cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates. Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated.
A variety of studies suggest that allelic losses at chromosome 2q are associated with aggressive behavior of various forms of human neoplasia. Using a probe to detect homozygous deletions on chromosome 2q21.2 in kidney and bladder cancer cell lines, we identified a new candidate tumor suppressor gene, lipoprotein receptor-related protein-deleted in tumors (LRP-DIT). The predicted LRP-DIT product of 4599 amino acids has extensive homology to a gigantic receptor, LRP1, which mediates endocytosis of multiple proteins from the cell surface. Homozygous deletions in LRP-DIT were detected in 17% (4 of 23) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The expression of only abnormal transcripts missing portions of the LRP-DIT sequence was demonstrated in an additional 30% (11 of 36) of NSCLC lines. Finally, a missense mutation at codon 3157 was detected in one of four NSCLC lines tested for the large open reading frame. In contrast, no LRP-DIT alterations were identified in a major fraction of SCLC cell lines, indicating that this gene is preferentially inactivated in one histological type of lung cancer. Our data suggest that inactivation of LRP-DIT occurs in at least 40% of NSCLC lines and thus may play an important role in tumorigenesis of NSCLCs.
A very rare side-effect of amlodipine is dysguesia. A review of the literature produced only one case. We report a case about a female with essential hypertension on drug treatment with amlodipine developed loss of taste sensation. Condition moderately improved on stoppage of the drug for 25 days. We conclude that amlodipine can cause dysguesia. Here, we describe the clinical presentation and review the relevant literature on amlodipine and dysguesia.
A wide spectrum of mutations, ranging from point mutations to large deletions, have been described in the retinoblastoma gene (RB1). Mutations have been found throughout the gene; however, these genetic alterations do not appear to be homogeneously distributed. In particular, a significant proportion of disease-causing mutations results in the premature termination of protein synthesis, and the majority of these mutations occur as C-- > T transitions at CpG dinucleotides (CpGs). Such recurrent CpG mutations, including those found in RB1, are likely the result of the deamination of 5-methylcytosine within these CpGs. In the present study, we used the sodiumbisulfite conversion method to detect cytosine methylation in representative exons of RB1. We analyzed DNA from a variety of tissues and specifically targeted CGA codons in RB1, where recurrent premature termination mutations have been reported. We found that DNA methylation within RB1 exons 8, 14, 25, and 27 appeared to be restricted to CpGs, including six CGA codons. Other codons containing methylated cytosines have not been reported to be mutated. Therefore, disease-causing mutations at CpGs in RB1 appear to be determined by several factors, including the constitutive presence of DNA methylation at cytosines within CpGs, the specific codon within which the methylated cytosine is located, and the particular region of the gene within which that codon resides..

AAC-11 overexpression induces invasion and protects cervical cancer cells from apoptosis.
ACC-9653, the disodium phosphate ester of 3-hydroxymethyl-5,5-diphenylhydantoin, is a prodrug of phenytoin with advantageous physicochemical properties. ACC-9653 is rapidly converted enzymatically to phenytoin in vivo. ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium have equivalent anticonvulsant activity against seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES) in mice following i.p., oral, or i.v. administration. The ED50 doses were 16 mg/kg for i.v. ACC-9653 and 8 mg/kg for i.v. phenytoin sodium. ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium have similar antiarrhythmic activity against ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia in anesthetized dogs. The total doses of ACC-9653 or phenytoin sodium necessary to convert the arrhythmia to a normal sinus rhythm were 24 +/- 6 and 14 +/- 3 mg/kg, respectively. Only phenytoin sodium displayed in vitro antiarrhythmic activity against strophanthidin-induced arrhythmias in guinea pig right atria. In anesthetized dogs, a high dose of ACC-9653 (31 mg/kg) was infused over 15, 20, and 30 min and the responses were compared to an equimolar dose of phenytoin sodium (21 mg/kg). The ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium treatments produced similar marked reductions in diastolic blood pressure and contractile force (LVdP/dt). The maximum effects of each treatment occurred at the time of maximum phenytoin sodium levels. Acute toxicity studies of ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium were carried out in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs by i.v., i.m., and i.p. routes of administration. The systemic toxic signs of both agents were similar and occurred at approximately equivalent doses. Importantly, the local irritation of ACC-9653 was markedly less than phenytoin sodium following i.m. administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
ADAM10-mediated cleavage of L1 adhesion molecule at the cell surface and in released membrane vesicles.
ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) are critical in the vesicular trafficking pathway. ARF activity is controlled by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). We have identified recently a novel tentative ARF GAP derived from human fetal liver, ARFGAP3 (originally named as ARFGAP1). In the present study, we demonstrated that ARFGAP3 had GAP activity in vitro and remarked that the GAP activity of ARFGAP3 was regulated by phospholipids, i.e. phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate as agonist and phosphatidylcholine as antagonist. ARFGAP3 is a predominantly cytosolic protein, and concentrated in the perinuclear region. Its transient ectopic overexpression in cultured mammalian cells reduced the constitutive secretion of secreted alkaline phosphatase, indicating that ectopic overexpression of ARFGAP3 inhibits the early secretory pathway of proteins in vivo. These results demonstrated that ARFGAP3 is a novel GAP for ARF1 and might be involved in intracellular traffic of proteins and vesicular transport as predicted.
AIM: Experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal DBS can control epileptic activity, but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defined. The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical epileptic activity in penicillin-induced epilepsy model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes. In group-1 (n=10) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group-2 (n=10) hippocampal DBS was on (185 Hz, 0.5V, 1V, 2V, and 5V for 60 sec) following penicillin G injection intracortically. In the control group hippocampal DBS was on following 8 l saline injection intracortically. EEG recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following penicillin-G injection, and at 10th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency, amplitude, and power spectrum. RESULTS: High frequency hippocampal DBS suppressed the acute penicillin-induced cortical epileptic activity independent from stimulus intensity. In the control group, hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5V stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic discharges. These results are important in terms of defining the optimal parameters of hippocampal DBS in patients with epilepsy.
AIM: Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor. Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression. In this study, we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in chlorpromazine-induced EPS in schizophrenic patients. METHODS: We identified seven SNP(single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141Cins>del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients (59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the Simpson-Angus Scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks. The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: Polymorphisms TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141Cins>del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between DRD2 and EPS in Caucasians.
AIM: Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a limiting side-effect of chemotherapy with ifosfamide (IFS). In the study presented here, we investigated the use of dexamethasone in combination with mesna for the prevention of IFS-induced HC. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (150-200 g; 6 rats per group) were treated with saline or mesna 5 min (i.p.) before and 2 and 6 h after (v.o.) administration of IFS. One, two or three doses of mesna were replaced with dexamethasone alone or with dexamethasone plus mesna. Cystitis was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis. RESULTS: The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of mesna with dexamethasone reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by IFS by 84.79% and 89.13%, respectively. In addition, it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by IFS. Moreover, the addition of dexamethasone to the last two doses of mesna was more efficient than three doses of mesna alone when evaluated microscopically. CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone in combination with mesna was efficient in blocking IFS-induced HC. However, the replacement of last two doses of mesna with saline or all of the mesna doses with dexamethasone did not prevent HC.
AIM: The aim of the documentation of this clinical case is to make clinicians aware of "meth mouth" and the medical risks associated with this serious condition. BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine is a very addictive, powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as cardiac dysrhythmias, hypertension, hallucinations, and violent behavior. Dental patients abusing methamphetamine can present with poor oral hygiene, xerostomia, rampant caries ("meth mouth"), and excessive tooth wear. Oral rehabilitation of patients using methamphetamine can be challenging. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old Caucasian woman presented with dental pain, bad breath, and self-reported poor esthetics. A comprehensive examination including her medical history, panoramic radiograph, and intraoral examination revealed 19 carious lesions, which is not very common for a healthy adult. She reported her use of methamphetamine for five years and had not experienced any major carious episodes before she started using the drug. SUMMARY: The patient's medical and dental histories along with radiographic and clinical findings lead to a diagnosis of "meth mouth." Although three different dental treatment modalities (either conventional or implant-supported) have been offered to the patient since August 2007, the patient has yet to initiate any treatment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This clinical case showing oral manifestations of meth mouth was presented to help dental practitioners recognize and manage patients who may be abusing methamphetamines. Dental practitioners also may be skeptical about the reliability of appointment keeping by these patients, as they frequently miss their appointments without reasonable justification.
AIM: This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on bruising and pain following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of heparin. BACKGROUND: Although different methods to prevent bruising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described, the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of bruising and pain is little documented. DESIGN: This study was designed as within-subject, quasi-experimental research. METHOD: The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous heparin was administered. Heparin was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site. Injections areas were assessed for the presence of bruising at 48 and 72 hours after each injection. Dimensions of the bruising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure pain intensity and a stop-watch was used to time the pain period. Data were analysed using chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation. RESULTS: The percentage of bruising occurrence was 64% with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42% in the 30-second injection. It was determined that the size of the bruising was smaller in the 30-second injection. Pain intensity and pain period were statistically significantly lower for the 30-second injection than for the 10-second injection. CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that injection duration had an effect on bruising and pain following the subcutaneous administration of heparin. This study should be repeated on a larger sample. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: When administering subcutaneous heparin injections, it is important to extend the duration of the injection.
AIM: To report a case of optic and peripheral neuropathy after chronic use of disulfiram for alcohol dependence management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case report. RESULTS: A 57-year-old male presented with gradual loss of vision in both eyes with intermittent headaches for 2 months. He also complained of paraesthesia with numbness in both feet. His vision was 6/15 and 2/60 in the right and left eyes, respectively. Fundoscopy revealed bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads. Visual field testing confirmed bilateral central-caecal scotomata. He had been taking disulfiram for alcohol dependence for the preceding 3 years. Disulfiram discontinuation lead to an immediate symptomatic improvement. CONCLUSION: Physicians initiating long-term disulfiram therapy should be aware of these adverse effects. They should recommend annual ophthalmic reviews with visual field testing. Patients should be reassured with respect to the reversibility of these adverse effects.
AIM: To study the change of lipid metabolism by antiandrogen therapy in patients with prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied with a 2.5 years follow-up the changes in plasma cholesterols (C), triglycerides (TG), lipoproteins (LP), and apolipoproteins (Apo) B-100, A-I, and A-II pro fi les in 24 patients of mean age 60 years with low risk prostate cancer (stage: T1cN0M0, Gleason score: 2-5) during treatment with cyproterone acetate (CPA) without surgical management or radiation therapy. RESULTS: Significant decreases of HDL-C, Apo A-I and Apo A-II and an increase of triglyceride levels in VLDL were induced by CPA. After a period of 2.5 years on CPA treatment, four patients out of twenty-four were found to be affected by coronary heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: Ischaemic coronary arteriosclerosis with an incidence rate of 16.6% as caused by prolonged CPA therapy is mediated through changes in HDL cholesterol, Apo A-I and Apo A-II pro fi les, other than the well-known hyperglyceridemic effect caused by estrogen.
AIM: To study the effects of testosterone on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced memory impairment in male rats. METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were intracerebroventricularly (icv) infused with STZ (750 ug) on d 1 and d 3, and a passive avoidance task was assessed 2 weeks after the first injection of STZ. Castration surgery was performed in another group of rats, and the passive avoidance task was assessed 4 weeks after the operation. Testosterone (1 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), sc), the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), ip), the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen (1 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), ip) or the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (4 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), ip) were administered for 6 d after the first injection of STZ. RESULTS: STZ administration and castration markedly decreased both STL1 (the short memory) and STL2 (the long memory) in passive avoidance tests. Testosterone replacement almost restored the STL1 and STL2 in castrated rats, and significantly prolonged the STL1 and STL2 in STZ-treated rats. Administration of flutamide, letrozole or tamoxifen significantly impaired the memory in intact rats, and significantly attenuated the testosterone replacement in improving STZ- and castration-induced memory impairment. CONCLUSION: Testosterone administration ameliorates STZ- and castration-induced memory impairment in male Wistar rats.
AIM: Verapamil stimulation test was previously investigated as a tool for differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, but with conflicting results. Macroprolactinemia was never considered in those previous studies. Here, we aimed to re-investigate the diagnostic value of verapamil in a population who were all screened for macroprolactinemia. Prolactin responses to verapamil in 65 female patients (age: 29.9 +/- 8.1 years) with hyperprolactinemia were tested in a descriptive, matched case-control study. METHODS: Verapamil 80 mg, p.o. was administered, and then PRL levels were measured at 8th and 16th hours, by immunometric chemiluminescence. Verapamil responsiveness was determined by peak percent change in basal prolactin levels (PRL). RESULTS: Verapamil significantly increased PRL levels in healthy controls (N. 8, PRL: 183%), macroprolactinoma (N. 8, PRL: 7%), microprolactinoma (N. 19, PRL: 21%), macroprolactinemia (N. 23, PRL: 126%), but not in pseudoprolactinoma (N. 8, PRL: 0.8%), and risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia (N. 7, PRL: 3%). ROC curve analysis revealed that unresponsiveness to verapamil defined as PRL <7%, discriminated anatomical or functional stalk effect (sensitivity: 74%, specificity: 73%, AUC: 0.855+/-0.04, P <0.001, CI: 0.768-0.942) associated with pseudoprolactinoma or risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia, respectively. CONCLUSION: Verapamil responsiveness is not a reliable finding for the differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia. However, verapamil unresponsiveness discriminates stalk effect (i.e., anatomically or functionally inhibited dopaminergic tonus) from other causes of hyperprolactinemia with varying degrees of responsiveness.
AIM: Widespread use of mannitol to reduce brain edema and lower elevated ICP in brain tumor patients continues to be afflicted by the so-called rebound phenomenon. Leakage of mannitol into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound . This has only been demonstrated experimentally in animals. As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of mannitol into the brain after administration to 21 brain tumor patients. METHODS: Mannitol (18% solution; 1 g/kg) was administered as a bolus to patients (ten had malignant glioma, seven brain metastases and four meningioma) about 30 minutes before craniotomy. During resection, a sample of the surrounding edematous white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample. Mannitol concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al. RESULTS: In most glioma patients, mannitol concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times). In meningioma and metastases patients plasma concentrations of mannitol were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that even after a single bolus, mannitol may leak through the altered BBB near gliomas, reversing the initial plasma-to-blood osmotic gradient, aggravating peritumoral edema and promoting rebound of ICP.
AIMS: Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anti-cancer therapeutic, but is associated with both acute and late-stage cardiotoxicity. Children are particularly sensitive to DOX-induced heart failure. Here, the impact of p53 inhibition on acute vs. late-stage DOX cardiotoxicity was examined in a juvenile model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-week-old MHC-CB7 mice (which express dominant-interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes) and their non-transgenic (NON-TXG) littermates received weekly DOX injections for 5 weeks (25 mg/kg cumulative dose). One week after the last DOX treatment (acute stage), MHC-CB7 mice exhibited improved cardiac function and lower levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with the NON-TXG mice. Surprisingly, by 13 weeks following the last DOX treatment (late stage), MHC-CB7 exhibited a progressive decrease in cardiac function and higher rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with NON-TXG mice. p53 inhibition blocked transient DOX-induced STAT3 activation in MHC-CB7 mice, which was associated with enhanced induction of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80. Mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of STAT3 exhibited worse cardiac function, higher levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and a greater induction of Ku70 and Ku80 in response to DOX treatment during the acute stage when compared with control animals. CONCLUSION: These data support a model wherein a p53-dependent cardioprotective pathway, mediated via STAT3 activation, mitigates DOX-induced myocardial stress during drug delivery. Furthermore, these data suggest an explanation as to how p53 inhibition can result in cardioprotection during drug treatment and, paradoxically, enhanced cardiotoxicity long after the cessation of drug treatment.
AIMS: Individuals with both diabetes mellitus (DM) and the Haptoglobin (Hp) 2-2 genotype are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. As the antioxidant function of the Hp 2-2 protein is impaired, we sought to test the pharmacogenomic hypothesis that antioxidant vitamin E supplementation would provide cardiovascular protection to Hp 2-2 DM individuals. MATERIALS & METHODS: We determined the Hp genotype on DM participants from two trials (HOPE and ICARE) and assessed the effect of vitamin E by Hp genotype on their common prespecified outcome, the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. Data was analyzed with a fixed-effect model. These results were input into a simulation model, the Evidence Based Medicine Integrator, in order to estimate their long-term implications in a real-world population from Kaiser Permanente (CA, USA). RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the two trials demonstrated a significant overall reduction in the composite end point in Hp 2-2 DM individuals with vitamin E (odds ratio: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.40-0.86; p = 0.006). There was a statistically significant interaction between the Hp genotype and vitamin E on the composite end point. In these trials, Hp typing of 69 DM individuals and treating those with the Hp 2-2 with vitamin E prevented one myocardial infarct, stroke or cardiovascular death. Lifelong administration of vitamin E to Hp 2-2 DM individuals in the Kaiser population would increase their life expectancy by 3 years. CONCLUSION: A pharmacogenomic strategy of screening DM individuals for the Hp genotype and treating those with Hp 2-2 with vitamin E appears to be highly clinically effective.
AIMS: Several SNPs and a microsatellite cytosine-adenine repeat promoter polymorphism of the IGF-1 gene have been reported to be associated with circulating IGF-1 serum concentrations. Variance in IGF-1 concentrations due to genetic variations may affect different response to growth hormone (GH) treatment, resulting in different individually required GH-doses in GH-deficient patients. The aim of this study was to test if the IGF-1 gene polymorphisms are associated with the GH-dose of GH-deficient adults. MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of nine tagging SNPs, five additionally selected SNPs and a cytosine-adenine repeat polymorphism were determined in 133 German adult patients (66 men, 67 women; mean age 45.4 years +/- 13.1 standard deviation; majority Caucasian) with GH-deficiency (GHD) of different origin, derived from the prospective Pfizer International Metabolic Study (KIMS) Pharmacogenetics Study. Patients received GH-treatment for 12 months with finished dose-titration of GH and centralized IGF-1 measurements. GH-dose after 1 year of treatment, IGF-1 concentrations, IGF-1-standard deviation score (SDS), the IGF-1:GH ratio and anthropometric data were analyzed by genotype. RESULTS: Except for rs1019731, which showed a significant difference of IGF-1-SDS by genotypes (p = 0.02), all polymorphisms showed no associations with the GH-doses, IGF-1 concentrations, IGF-1-SDS and IGF-1:GH ratio after adjusting for the confounding variables gender, age and BMI. CONCLUSION: IGF-1 gene polymorphisms were not associated with the responsiveness to exogenous GH in GHD. Therefore, genetic variations of the IGF-1 gene seem not to be major influencing factors of the GH-IGF-axis causing variable response to exogenous GH-treatment.
AIMS: This study sought to assess the risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) associated with initial treatment of type 2 diabetes with different sulphonylureas. METHODS: In type 2 diabetic patients, cases who developed CAD were compared retrospectively with controls that did not. The 20-year risk of CAD at diagnosis of diabetes, using the UKPDS risk engine, was used to match cases with controls. RESULTS: The 76 cases of CAD were compared with 152 controls. The hazard of developing CAD (95% CI) associated with initial treatment increased by 2.4-fold (1.3-4.3, P=0.004) with glibenclamide; 2-fold (0.9-4.6, P=0.099) with glipizide; 2.9-fold (1.6-5.1, P=0.000) with either, and was unchanged with metformin. The hazard decreased 0.3-fold (0.7-1.7, P=0.385) with glimepiride, 0.4-fold (0.7-1.3, P=0.192) with gliclazide, and 0.4-fold (0.7-1.1, P=0.09) with either. CONCLUSIONS: Initiating treatment of type 2 diabetes with glibenclamide or glipizide is associated with increased risk of CAD in comparison to gliclazide or glimepiride. If confirmed, this may be important because most Indian patients receive the cheaper older sulphonylureas, and present guidelines do not distinguish between individual agents.
AIMS: To date, there have been relatively few studies on the UGT1A6 gene in the Chinese population. The present study was designed to determine the allele frequencies and haplotypes of this gene in the population and predict the candidate functional mutations. MATERIALS & METHODS: We carried out the first systematic screening of polymorphisms of the gene in an SNP analysis involving 1074 Chinese subjects from three ethnic groups, namely Han, Dong and She, using direct sequencing. We identified the putative substrate binding pocket using a homology-modeled structure and produced a practical model for predicting the function of polymorphisms in UGT1A6. RESULTS: A total of six SNPs and 10 mutations were detected including nine known and seven novel ones. The novel mutations were 73G>A (V25I), 89T>G (L30R), 222A>C, 657C>A, 773A>T (D258V), 1040A>G (N347S) and 1467C>T. In addition, we detected, for the first time in the Chinese population, SNPs 105C>T, 627G>T as well as mutations 308C>A (S103X), IVS2+15T>C and 1088C>T (P363L). Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed among 19T>G, 315A>G, 541A>G and 552A>C. There were seven haplotypes whose frequencies were more than 0.01 in one or more of the three ethnic groups. P363L in the C-terminal domain might weaken the binding of cofactor UDPGA to the domain and induce a poor metabolism genotype of UGT1A6. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that genetic polymorphisms in UGT1A6 may contribute to interindividual and intra-ethnic differences. The results should prove helpful in the development of pharmacogenomics in China.
AIMS: To investigate whether alterations of myocardial strain and high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (cTnT) could predict future cardiac dysfunction in patients after epirubicin exposure. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with epirubicin were studied. Blood collection and echocardiography were performed at baseline, 1 day after the third cycle, and 1 day after completion of chemotherapy. Patients were studied using echocardiography during follow-up. Global longitudinal (GLS), circumferential (GCS), and radial strain (GRS) were calculated using speckle tracking echocardiography. Left ventricular ejection fraction was analysed by real-time 3D echocardiography. Cardiotoxicity was defined as a reduction of the LVEF of >5% to <55% with symptoms of heart failure or an asymptomatic reduction of the LVEF of >10% to <55%. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (18.67%) developed cardiotoxicity after treatment. GLS (-18.48 + 1.72% vs. -15.96 + 1.6%), GCS (-20.93 + 2.86% vs. -19.20 + 3.21%), and GRS (39.23 + 6.44% vs. 34.98 + 6.2%) were markedly reduced and cTnT was elevated from 0.0010 + 0.0020 to 0.0073 + 0.0038 ng/mL (P all < 0.01) at the completion of chemotherapy compared with baseline values. A >15.9% decrease in GLS [sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 75%; area under the curve (AUC) = 0.815; P = 0.001] and a >0.004 ng/mL elevation in cTnT (sensitivity, 79%; specificity, 64%; AUC = 0.757; P = 0.005) from baseline to the third cycle of chemotherapy predicted later cardiotoxicity. The decrease in GLS remained the only independent predictor of cardiotoxicity (P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: GLS combined with cTnT may provide a reliable and non-invasive method to predict cardiac dysfunction in patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is viewed as an energy sensor that acts to modulate glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Given that protein synthesis is a high energy-consuming process, it may be transiently depressed during cellular energy stress. Thus, the intent of this investigation was to examine whether AMPK activation modulates the translational control of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. Injections of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-d-ribonucleoside (AICAR) were used to activate AMPK in male rats. The activity of alpha1 AMPK remained unchanged in gastrocnemius muscle from AICAR-treated animals compared with controls, whereas alpha2 AMPK activity was significantly increased (51%). AICAR treatment resulted in a reduction in protein synthesis to 45% of the control value. This depression was associated with decreased activation of protein kinases in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase B on Ser(473), mTOR on Ser(2448), ribosomal protein S6 kinase on Thr(389), and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E-binding protein on Thr(37). A reduction in eIF4E associated with eIF4G to 10% of the control value was also noted. In contrast, eIF2B activity remained unchanged in response to AICAR treatment and therefore would not appear to contribute to the depression in protein synthesis. This is the first investigation to demonstrate changes in translation initiation and skeletal muscle protein synthesis in response to AMPK activation.
AMP-activated protein kinase suppresses protein synthesis in rat skeletal muscle through down-regulated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling.
APAF-1 plays a pivotal role in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, binding to cytochrome c and favoring activation of caspase-9. It has been shown that epigenetic silencing of the APAF-1 gene is a common event in several metastatic melanoma cells in vitro. We determined, by Western blot, variation in the level of expression of APAF-1 in several human melanoma cell lines and, by immunohistochemistry, in a group of 106 histological samples including benign and malignant melanocytic lesions. We observed APAF-1 down-regulation or loss of expression in two metastatic melanoma cell lines, compared to primary melanoma cell lines. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant difference in APAF-1 staining between nevi and melanomas. In addition, we found a significant negative correlation between APAF-1 expression level and tumor thickness and between primary melanomas and metastases. We conclude that loss of APAF-1 expression can be considered as an indicator of malignant transformation in melanoma.
APC is often cited as a prime example of a tumor suppressor gene. Truncating germline and somatic mutations (or, infrequently, allelic loss) occur in tumors in FAP (familial adenomatous polyposis). Most sporadic colorectal cancers also have two APC mutations. Clues from attenuated polyposis, missense germline variants with mild disease and the somatic mutation cluster region (codons 1, 250-1, 450) indicate, however, that APC mutations might not result in simple loss of protein function. We have found that FAP patients with germline APC mutations within a small region (codons 1, 194-1, 392 at most) mainly show allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas, in contrast to other FAP patients, whose second hits tend to occur by truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region. Our results indicate that different APC mutations provide cells with different selective advantages, with mutations close to codon 1, 300 providing the greatest advantage. Allelic loss is selected strongly in cells with one mutation near codon 1, 300. A different germline-somatic APC mutation association exists in FAP desmoids. APC is not, therefore, a classical tumor suppressor. Our findings also indicate a new mechanism for disease severity if a broader spectrum of mutations is selected in tumors, the somatic mutation rate is effectively higher and more tumors grow..

ATM phosphorylates p95/nbs1 in an S-phase checkpoint pathway.
ATM, the gene mutated in the inherited human disease ataxia-telangiectasia, is a member of a family of kinases involved in DNA metabolism and cell-cycle checkpoint control. To help clarify the physiological roles of the ATM protein, we disrupted the ATM gene in mice through homologous recombination. Initial evaluation of the ATM knockout animals indicates that inactivation of the mouse ATM gene recreates much of the phenotype of ataxia-telangiectasia. The homozygous mutant (ATM-/-) mice are viable, growth-retarded, and infertile. The infertility of ATM-/- mice results from meiotic failure. Meiosis is arrested at the zygotene/pachytene stage of prophase I as a result of abnormal chromosomal synapsis and subsequent chromosome fragmentation. Immune defects also are evident in ATM-/- mice, including reduced numbers of B220 + CD43- pre-B cells, thymocytes, and peripheral T cells, as well as functional impairment of T-cell-dependent immune responses. The cerebella of ATM-/- mice appear normal by histologic examination at 3 to 4 months and the mice have no gross behavioral abnormalities. The majority of mutant mice rapidly develop thymic lymphomas and die before 4 months of age. These findings indicate that the ATM gene product plays an essential role in a diverse group of cellular processes, including meiosis, the normal growth of somatic tissues, immune development, and tumor suppression..

ATP7B, the gene altered in Wilson disease (WD) patients, lies in a block of homology shared between human chromosome 13q14 and the central region of mouse chromosome 14. However, we have mapped the murine homologue of ATP7B (Atp7b) to mouse chromosome 8 by somatic cell hybrid analysis. Analysis of 80 interspecific backcross offspring was used to position Atp7b close to D8Mit3 and another ATPase locus, Atp4b, on mouse chromosome 8. ATP4B lies in 13q34 and is separated from ATP7B by several loci whose mouse homologues map to mouse chromosome 14. The assignment of Atp7b to mouse chromosome 8 identifies a previously unrecognized region of homology between this chromosome and human chromosome 13. This assignment suggests a possible location for the toxic milk mutation in the mouse, which has been proposed as a homologue of WD..
AZT has induced a macrocytic anemia in AIDS patients on long term AZT therapy. It is generally assumed that DNA elongation is stopped by the insertion of AZT into the chain in place of thymidine thus preventing the phosphate hydroxyl linkages and therefore suppresses hemopoietic progenitor cell proliferation in an early stage of differentiation. CBA/Ca male mice started on AZT 0.75 mg/ml H2O at 84 days of age and kept on it for 687 days when dosage reduced to 0.5 mg/ml H2O for a group, another group removed from AZT to see recovery, and third group remained on 0.75 mg. At 687 days mice that had been on 0.75 mg had average platelet counts of 2.5 x 10(6). Histological examination on 9 of 10 mice with such thrombocytopenia showed changes compatible with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A variety of histological patterns was observed. There were two cases of hypocellular myelodysplasia, two cases of hypersegmented myelodysplastic granulocytosis, two cases of hypercellular marrow with abnormal megakaryocytes with bizarre nuclei, one case of megakaryocytic myelosis associated with a hyperplastic marrow, dysmyelopoiesis and a hypocellular marrow and two cases of myelodysplasia with dyserythropoiesis, hemosiderosis and a hypocellular marrow. Above mentioned AZT incorporation may have induced an ineffective hemopoiesis in the primitive hemopoietic progenitor cells, which is known to be seen commonly in the myelodysplastic syndrome.
Aarskog-Scott Syndrome (AAS) is an X-linked disorder characterised by short stature and multiple facial, limb and genital abnormalities. A gene, FGD1, altered in a patient with AAS phenotype, has been identified and found to encode a protein with homology to Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho/Rac GEF). However, since this original report on identification of a mutated FGD1 gene in an AAS patient, no additional mutations in the FGD1 gene have been described. We analysed 13 independent patients with clinical diagnosis of AAS. One patient presented a mutation that results in a nucleotide change in exon 10 of the FGD1 gene (G2559 > A) substituting a Gln for Arg in position 610. The mutation was found to segregate with the AAS phenotype in affected males and carrier females in the family of this patient. Interestingly, Arg-610 is located within one of the two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of the FGD1 gene and it corresponds to a highly conserved residue which has been involved in InsP binding in PH domains of other proteins. The same residue is often mutated in the Brutons tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene in patients with an X-linked agammaglobulinemia. The Arg610Gln mutation represents the first case of a mutation in the PH domain of the FGD1 gene and additional evidence that mutations in PH domains can be associated to human diseases..

Abnormal CAG expansions in the IT-15 gene are associated with Huntington disease (HD). In the diagnostic setting it is necessary to define the limits of the CAG size ranges on normal and HD-associated chromosomes. Most large analyses that defined the limits of the normal and pathological size ranges employed PCR assays, which included the CAG repeats and a CCG repeat tract that was thought to be invariant. Many of these experiments found an overlap between the normal and disease size ranges. Subsequent findings that the CCG repeats vary by 8 trinucleotide lengths suggested that the limits of the normal and disease size ranges should be reevaluated with assays that exclude the CCG polymorphism. Since patients with between 30 and 40 repeats are rare, a consortium was assembled to collect such individuals. All 178 samples were reanalyzed in Cambridge by using assays specific for the CAG repeats. We have optimized methods for reliable sizing of CAG repeats and show cases that demonstrate the dangers of using PCR assays that include both the CAG and CCG polymorphisms. Seven HD patients had 36 repeats, which confirms that this allele is associated with disease. Individuals without apparent symptoms or signs of HD were found at 36 repeats (aged 74, 78, 79, and 87 years), 37 repeats (aged 69 years), 38 repeats (aged 69 and 90 years), and 39 repeats (aged 67, 90, and 95 years). The detailed case histories of an exceptional case from this series will be presented a 95-year-old man with 39 repeats who did not have classical features of HD. The apparently healthy survival into old age of some individuals with 36-39 repeats suggests that the HD mutation may not always be fully penetrant..
Abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with a predominant loss of the Purkinje cell. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNA from mouse Purkinje cells revealed a predominant expression of the alpha1A channel lacking an asparagine-proline (NP) stretch in the domain IV (alpha1A(-NP)). Human alpha1A channels carrying various polyglutamine length with or without NP were expressed in HEK293 cells, and channel properties were compared using a whole-cell voltage clamp technique. alpha1A(-NP), corresponding to P-type channel, with 24 and 28 polyglutamines found in patients showed the voltage dependence of inactivation shifting negatively by 6 and 11 mV, respectively, from the 13 polyglutamine control. Contrarily, the alpha1A channel with NP (alpha1A(+NP)), corresponding to Q-type channel, with 28 polyglutamines exhibited a positive shift of 5 mV. These results suggest that altered function of alpha1A(-NP) may contribute to degeneration of Purkinje cells, which express predominantly alpha1A(-NP), due to the reduced Ca(2+) influx resulting from the negative shift of voltage-dependent inactivation. On the other hand, other types of neurons, expressing both alpha1A(-NP) and alpha1A(+NP), may survive because the positive shift of voltage-dependent inactivation of alpha1A(+NP) compensates Ca(2+) influx.
Abnormal amplification of a CTG repeat on chromosome 19 is the molecular basis of myotonic dystrophy (DM). Expansion of the repeat has been correlated with severity of several clinical features of the disease. We performed extensive cognitive testing, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a molecular analysis in 28 cases of DM to determine the relationship between the molecular defect and brain disease. Performance in two or more cognitive tests was pathological in 10 cases. Fourteen patients had subcortical white matter lesions on MRI, 14 had cerebral atrophy. Amplification of the CTG repeat showed a strong correlation with cognitive test deficits when exceeding a length of over 1000 trinucleotides. MRI lesions were associated with impaired psychometric performance, but MRI and molecular findings were only weakly related. Disease duration influenced the appearance and amount of white matter lesions on MRI. Quantification of CTG repeat size may allow an early estimate on the probability of brain involvement in DM; cognitive dysfunction is associated with white matter lesions and cerebral atrophy later on in the course..
Abnormal development of Purkinje cells and lymphocytes in Atm mutant mice.
Abnormal hepatic copper accumulation is recognized as an inherited disorder in man, mouse, rat and dog. The major cause of hepatic copper accumulation in man is a dysfunctional ATP7B gene, causing Wilson disease (WD). Mutations in the ATP7B genes have also been demonstrated in mouse and rat. The ATP7B gene has been excluded in the much rarer human copper overload disease non-Indian childhood cirrhosis, indicating genetic heterogeneity. By investigating the common autosomal recessive copper toxicosis (CT) in Bedlington terriers, we have identified a new locus involved in progressive liver disease. We examined whether the WD gene ATP7B was also causative for CT by investigating the chromosomal co-localization of ATP7B and C04107, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). C04107 is an anonymous microsatellite marker closely linked to CT. However, BAC clones containing ATP7B and C04107 mapped to the canine chromosome regions CFA22q11 and CFA10q26, respectively, demonstrating that WD cannot be homologous to CT. The copper transport genes CTR1 and CTR2 were also excluded as candidate genes for CT since they both mapped to canine chromosome region CFA11q22. 2-22. 5. A transcribed sequence identified from the C04107-containing BAC was found to be homologous to a gene expressed from human chromosome 2p13-p16, a region devoid of any positional candidate genes.

Abnormal involuntary movements appeared in the mouth, tongue, neck and abdomen of a 64-year-old male patient after he took metoclopramide for gastrointestinal disorder in a regimen of 30 mg per day for a total of about 260 days. The symptoms exacerbated to a maximum in a month. When the metoclopramide administration was discontinued, the abnormal movements gradually improved to a considerable extent. Attention to the possible induction of specific tardive dyskinesia is called for in the use of this drug.
Abnormal myotonic dystrophy protein kinase levels produce only mild myopathy in mice.
Abnormal processing of somatosensory inputs in the central nervous system (central sensitization) is the mechanism accounting for the enhanced pain sensitivity in the skin surrounding tissue injury (secondary hyperalgesia). Secondary hyperalgesia shares clinical characteristics with neurogenic hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain. Abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with hyperalgesia as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of gabapentin, a drug effective in neuropathic pain patients, on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization states. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in normal volunteers, we studied the gabapentin-induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia. The dose of gabapentin was 1,800 mg per os, in a single administration. We found that (i) gabapentin reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex, independently of the presence of central sensitization; (ii) gabapentin reduced the activation in the brainstem, only during central sensitization; (iii) gabapentin suppressed stimulus-induced deactivations, only during central sensitization; this effect was more robust than the effect on brain activation. The observed drug-induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline fMRI signal. These findings indicate that gabapentin has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger antihyperalgesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation, thus supporting the concept that gabapentin is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present.
Abnormalities of chromosome region 15q11-13 are associated with Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Differences between the methylation patterns of the region of chromosome 15q11-13 which hybridizes to the highly conserved DNA, DN34, in normal individuals and in patients with AS and PWS have been described. We report on a family in which first cousins are affected by AS and PWS as a result of a familial paracentric inversion of 15q11-q13. The results of the studies on this family demonstrate the differences in the methylation patterns in the 2 conditions and the phenomenon of genomic imprinting, whereby genetic information is expressed differently dependent on the parent of origin..

Abstract Serum aminotransferase elevations are a commonly known adverse effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy. However, hepatotoxic events have not been widely published with ezetimibe or the combination agent simvastatin-ezetimibe. We describe a 70-year-old Hispanic woman who developed fulminant hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from simvastatin 40 mg/day to simvastatin 10 mg-ezetimibe 40 mg/day. The patient's lipid panel had been maintained with simvastatin for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of hepatotoxicity. A routine laboratory work-up 10 weeks after conversion revealed elevated serum aminotransferase levels. Simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram (which she was taking for depression) were discontinued, and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded. A repeat work-up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels, and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate-to-severe drug toxicity. She underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course. Her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23, and her 2-year follow-up showed no adverse events. Ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases (UGT) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin hydroxy acid, resulting in increased simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of simvastatin-ezetimibe-induced liver failure that resulted in liver transplantation. We postulate that the mechanism of the simvastatinezetimibe-induced hepatotoxicity is the increased simvastatin exposure by ezetimibe inhibition of UGT enzymes. Clinicians should be aware of potential hepatotoxicity with simvastatin-ezetimibe especially in elderly patients and should carefully monitor serum aminotransferase levels when starting therapy and titrating the dosage.

According to recent genome-wide association studies, a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of the present study was to investigate the association among the polymorphisms of SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, FTO, WFS1, CDKAL1 and KCNQ1 and the risk of T2DM in the Korean population. This study was based on a multicenter case-control study, including 908 patients with T2DM and 502 non-diabetic controls. We genotyped rs13266634, rs1111875, rs10811661, rs4402960, rs8050136, rs734312, rs7754840 and rs2237892 and measured the body weight, body mass index and fasting plasma glucose in all patients and controls. The strongest association was found in a variant of CDKAL1 [rs7754840, odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.50-2.10, p = 5.0 x 10(-11)]. The G allele of rs1111875 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.18-1.72, p = 1.8 x 10(-4)) in HHEX), the T allele of rs10811661 (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.23-1.75, p = 2.1 x 10(-5)) in CDKN2A/B) and the C allele of rs2237892 (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.10-1.56, p = 0.003) in KCNQ1 showed significant associations with T2DM. Rs13266634 (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.00-1.42, p = 0.045) in SLC30A8 showed a nominal association with the risk of T2DM, whereas SNPs in IGF2BP2, FTO and WFS1 were not associated. In conclusion, we have shown that SNPs in HHEX, CDKN2A/B, CDKAL1, KCNQ1 and SLC30A8 confer a risk of T2DM in the Korean population.
Accurate patient history contributes to differentiating diabetes insipidus: a case study.
Acetaminophen (APAP) produces proximal tubular necrosis in Fischer 344 (F344) rats. Recently, p-aminophenol (PAP), a known potent nephrotoxicant, was identified as a metabolite of APAP in F344 rats. The purpose of this study was to determine if PAP formation is a requisite step in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity. Therefore, the effect of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP), an acylamidase inhibitor, on APAP and PAP nephrotoxicity and metabolism was determined. BNPP (1 to 8 mM) reduced APAP deacetylation and covalent binding in F344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of animals with BNPP prior to APAP or PAP administration resulted in marked reduction of APAP (900 mg/kg) nephrotoxicity but not PAP nephrotoxicity. This result was not due to altered disposition of either APAP or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissue. Rather, BNPP pretreatment reduced the fraction of APAP excreted as PAP by 64 and 75% after APAP doses of 750 and 900 mg/kg. BNPP did not alter the excretion of APAP or any of its non-deacetylated metabolites nor did BNPP alter excretion of PAP or its metabolites after PAP doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg. Therefore, the BNPP-induced reduction in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity appears to be due to inhibition of APAP deacetylation. It is concluded that PAP formation, in vivo, accounts, at least in part, for APAP-induced renal tubular necrosis.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biogenesis of long-chain fatty acids. In order to understand the mechanisms that regulate human acetyl-CoA carboxylase at the gene level, and the relationship between its structure and function, cDNA clones for human acetyl-CoA carboxylase have been isolated and sequenced. Human acetyl-CoA-carboxylase cDNA contains 7020 nucleotides encoding a protein of 2340 amino acids with a calculated relative molecular mass of 264575. The human enzyme shows approximately 85% identity in nucleotide sequence with previously cloned rat acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and shows 90% identity in the amino acid sequence. Two human acetyl-CoA-carboxylase mRNA species, which differ in the 5' untranslated region with the same coding sequence, have been identified. The sequence analysis reveals that type I and type II acetyl-CoA-carboxylase mRNA contain 313- and 173-base-long 5' untranslated regions, respectively. The first 240 nucleotides in the 5' untranslated region of type I acetyl-CoA-carboxylase mRNA replace the first 100 nucleotides of the (G + C)-rich region of the 5' untranslated region of the type II mRNA. These two species of mRNAs are the only species of human ACC mRNA which have been detected compared to at least five species in rat tissues, and they are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.
Aconitine is a major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloid with high content derived from herbal aconitum plants. Emerging evidence indicates that voltage-dependent Na(+) channels have pivotal roles in the cardiotoxicity of aconitine. However, no reports are available on the role of Ca(2+) in aconitine poisoning. In this study, we explored the importance of pathological Ca(2+) signaling in aconitine poisoning in vitro and in vivo. We found that Ca(2+) overload lead to accelerated beating rhythm in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused arrhythmia in conscious freely moving rats. To investigate effects of aconitine on myocardial injury, we performed cytotoxicity assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), as well as measured lactate dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of NRVMs and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats. The results showed that aconitine resulted in myocardial injury and reduced NRVMs viability dose-dependently. To confirm the pro-apoptotic effects, we performed flow cytometric detection, cardiac histology, transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay. The results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis time-dependently. The expression analysis of Ca(2+) handling proteins demonstrated that aconitine promoted Ca(2+) overload through the expression regulation of Ca(2+) handling proteins. The expression analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed that pro-apoptotic protein expression was upregulated, and anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 expression was downregulated. Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of MAPK family members, especially the P-P38/P38 ratio was found in cardiac tissues. Hence, our results suggest that aconitine significantly aggravates Ca(2+) overload and causes arrhythmia and finally promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.
Aconitine-induced Ca2+ overload causes arrhythmia and triggers apoptosis through p38 MAPK signaling pathway in rats.
Acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome: report of a child with phenotypic overlap with ulnar-mammary syndrome and a new mutation in TP63.
Acromegaly is an endocrine disorder caused by chronic excessive growth hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. Significant disfiguring changes occur as a result of bone, cartilage, and soft tissue hypertrophy, including the thickening of the skin, coarsening of facial features, and cutis verticis gyrata. Pseudoacromegaly, on the other hand, is the presence of similar acromegaloid features in the absence of elevated growth hormone or insulin-like growth factor levels. We present a patient with pseudoacromegaly that resulted from the long-term use of minoxidil at an unusually high dose. This is the first case report of pseudoacromegaly as a side effect of minoxidil use.

Activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase contributes to development of doxorubicin-induced heart failure.
Activation of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) by oxidant-mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic. Thus, we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Using a dual approach of PARP-1 suppression, by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor PJ34, we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by DOX. PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1-/- mice received a single injection of DOX (25 mg/kg i.p). Five days after DOX administration, left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in PARP-1+/+ mice, but only to a smaller extent in PARP-1-/- ones. Similar experiments were conducted in BALB/c mice treated with PJ34 or vehicle. Treatment with a PJ34 significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and increased the survival of the animals. In addition PJ34 significantly reduced the DOX-induced increase in the serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart. Thus, PARP activation contributes to the cardiotoxicity of DOX. PARP inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe cardiac complications associated with the DOX treatment.
Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) deficiency causes the autosomal recessive form of the Hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM2).
Activator-dependent transcription in mammalian cells requires upstream stimulatory activity (USA)-derived cofactors in addition to those present in TFIID. A novel positive cofactor (PC4) purified from the human USA fraction effected a marked enhancement (up to 85-fold) of GAL4-AH-dependent transcription in conjunction with TFIID and other general factors. Isolation of a corresponding cDNA identified PC4 as a 127 residue single-stranded DNA-binding protein with serine-rich regions near the N-terminus. Recombinant PC4 was functionally equivalent to native PC4, and both proteins markedly enhanced activation by diverse activation domains fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. Recombinant PC4 interacted independently both with free or DNA-bound VP16 activation domains and with free or DNA-bound TFIIA-TBP complexes (but not with TBP alone). These results indicate that PC4 is a general coactivator that functions cooperatively with TAFs and mediates functional interactions between upstream activators and the general transcriptional machinery.

Acute doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticle (DXNP) renal toxicity was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental glomerulonephritis. In normal rats, 2/6 rats given free doxorubicin (DX) (5 mg/kg) died within one week, whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or DXNP survived. A 3 times higher proteinuria appeared in animals treated with DXNP than in those treated with DX. Free NP did not provoke any proteinuria. Two hr post-injection, DXNP was 2.7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free DX (p < 0.025). In rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis, 5/6 rats given DX died within 7 days, in contrast to animals treated by DXNP, NP, or untreated, which all survived. Proteinuria appeared in all series, but was 2-5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged after doxorubicin treatment (400-700 mg/day), without significant difference between DXNP and DX. Rats treated by unloaded NP behaved as controls. These results demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, DXNP killed less animals than free DX, despite of an enhanced renal toxicity of the former. Both effects (better survival and nephrosis) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial cells.

Acute experimental models of renal damage to the proximal tubular, glomerular, and papillary regions of the rat were produced by administration of hexachloro-1:3-butadiene (HCBD), puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN), and 2-bromoethylamine (BEA), respectively. Several routine indicators of nephrotoxicity, the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, and the molecular weight of protein excretion were determined on urine samples. Tubular damage produced by HCBD or BEA was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from glomerular damage produced by PAN. The latter was characterized by a pronounced increase in protein excretion, especially proteins with molecular weight greater than 40,000 Da. In contrast, protein excretion in tubular damage was raised only slightly and characterized by excretion of proteins of a wide range of molecular weights. Proximal tubular damage caused by HCBD and papillary damage caused by BEA were distinguished both by conventional urinalysis (volume and specific gravity) and by measurement of the two urinary enzymes. Alkaline phosphatase and glucose were markedly and transiently elevated in proximal tubular damage and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase showed a sustained elevation in papillary damage. It is concluded that both selective urinary enzymes and the molecular weight pattern of urinary proteins can be used to provide diagnostic information about the possible site of renal damage.

One month previously, she had taken a single high dose of disulfiram (130 tablets of ALCOHOL STOP TAB, Shin-Poong Pharm. Co., Ansan, Korea) in a suicide attempt. She was not an alcoholic. For the first few days after ingestion, she was in a confused state and had mild to moderate ataxia and giddiness. She noticed hoarseness and distally accentuated motor and sensory dysfunction after she had recovered from this state. A nerve conduction study was consistent with severe sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Laryngeal electromyography (thyroarytenoid muscle) showed ample denervation potentials. Laryngoscopy revealed asymmetric vocal fold movements during phonation. Her vocal change and weakness began to improve spontaneously about 3 weeks after transfer. This was a case of acute palsy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and superimposed severe acute sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy caused by high-dose disulfiram intoxication.

Acute toxic dosage-dependent behavioral effects of caffeine were compared in adult males from seven inbred mouse strains (A/J, BALB/cJ, CBA/J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, SWR/J). C57BL/6J, chosen as a "prototypic" mouse strain, was used to determine behavioral responses to a broad range (5-500 mg/kg) of caffeine doses. Five phenotypic characteristics--locomotor activity, righting ability, clonic seizure induction, stress-induced lethality, death without external stress--were scored at various caffeine doses in drug-naive animals under empirically optimized, rigidly constant experimental conditions. Mice (n = 12 for each point) received single IP injections of a fixed volume/g body weight of physiological saline carrier with or without caffeine in doses ranging from 125-500 mg/kg. Loss of righting ability was scored at 1, 3, 5 min post dosing and at 5 min intervals thereafter for 20 min. In the same animals the occurrence of clonic seizures was scored as to time of onset and severity for 20 min after drug administration. When these proceeded to tonic seizures, death occurred in less than 20 min. Animals surviving for 20 min were immediately stressed by a swim test in 25 degrees C water, and death-producing tonic seizures were scored for 2 min. In other animals locomotor activity was measured 15 or 60 min after caffeine administration. By any single behavioral criterion or a combination of these criteria, marked differences in response to toxic caffeine doses were observed between strains. These results indicate that behavioral toxicity testing of alkylxanthines in a single mouse strain may be misleading and suggest that toxic responses of the central nervous system to this class of compounds are genetically influenced in mammals.
Acute treatment with metformin has a protective effect in myocardial infarction by suppression of inflammatory responses due to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In the present study, the effect of chronic pre-treatment with metformin on cardiac dysfunction and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activities following myocardial infarction and their relation with AMPK were assessed. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups (n=6): normal control and groups were injected isoproterenol after chronic pre-treatment with 0, 25, 50, or 100mg/kg of metformin twice daily for 14 days. Isoproterenol (100mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously on the 13th and 14th days to induce acute myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol alone decreased left ventricular systolic pressure and myocardial contractility indexed as LVdp/dtmax and LVdp/dtmin. The left ventricular dysfunction was significantly lower in the groups treated with 25 and 50mg/kg of metformin. Metfromin markedly lowered isoproterenol-induced elevation in the levels of TLR4 mRNA, myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the heart tissues. Similar changes were also seen in the serum levels of TNF-a and IL-6. However, the lower doses of 25 and 50mg/kg were more effective than 100mg/kg. Phosphorylated AMPKa (p-AMPK) in the myocardium was significantly elevated by 25mg/kg of metformin, slightly by 50mg/kg, but not by 100mg/kg. Chronic pre-treatment with metformin reduces post-myocardial infarction cardiac dysfunction and suppresses inflammatory responses, possibly through inhibition of TLR4 activities. This mechanism can be considered as a target to protect infarcted myocardium.
Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis (ATIN) is an important cause of acute renal failure resulting from a variety of insults, including immune complex-mediated tubulo-interstitial injury, but drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a far more frequent cause. Overall, as an entity, ATIN remains under-diagnosed, as symptoms resolve spontaneously if the medication is stopped. We report on a 14-year-old boy who developed acute renal failure 2 weeks after aortic valve surgery. He was put on aspirin following surgery and took ibuprofen for fever for nearly a week prior to presentation. He then presented to the emergency department feeling quite ill and was found to have a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration of of 147 mg/dl, creatinine of 15.3 mg/dl and serum potassium of 8.7 mEq/l. Dialysis was immediately initiated. A kidney biopsy showed inflammatory infiltrate consistent with ATIN. However, in the tubular basement membrane (TBM), very intense granular deposits of polyclonal IgG and C3 were noted. He needed dialysis for 2 weeks and was treated successfully with steroids for 6 months. His renal recovery and disappearance of proteinuria took a year. In conclusion, this is a first report of NSAIDs-associated ATIN, showing deposits of granular immune complex present only in the TBM and not in the glomeruli.
Acute vanishing bile duct syndrome is a rare but established cause of progressive cholestasis in adults, is most often drug or toxin related, and is of unknown pathogenesis. It has not been reported previously in children. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a well-recognized immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction that affects all age groups, is drug or infection induced, and has classic systemic, mucosal, and dermatologic manifestations. A previously healthy child who developed acute, severe, rapidly progressive vanishing bile duct syndrome shortly after Stevens-Johnson syndrome is described; this was temporally associated with ibuprofen use. Despite therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid, prednisone, and then tacrolimus, her cholestatic disease was unrelenting, with cirrhosis shown by biopsy 6 months after presentation. This case documents acute drug-related vanishing bile duct syndrome in the pediatric age group and suggests shared immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of both Stevens-Johnson syndrome and vanishing bile duct syndrome.
Acute vocal fold palsy after acute disulfiram intoxication.
Adapter proteins link catalytic signaling proteins to cell surface receptors or downstream effector proteins. In this paper, we present the cDNA sequence F2771, isolated from an activated CD8+ T cell cDNA library. The F2771 cDNA encodes a novel putative adapter protein. The predicted amino acid sequence includes an SH2 domain as well as putative SH3 and phosphotyrosine binding interaction motifs, but lacks any known catalytic domains. The expression of the gene is limited to tissues of the immune system and, in particular, activated T cells. The protein expressed by F2771 cDNA in transfected COS cells is localized in the cytoplasm. A polyclonal antiserum raised against an F2771-encoded peptide reacts with a tyrosine-phosphorylated 52-kDa protein expressed in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The gene is localized to chromosome 1q21, a region often found to be aberrant in lymphomas. The T cell-specific expression and the rapid induction of mRNA expression upon receptor binding, as well as the lack of catalytic domains in the presence of protein interaction domains, indicate that the F2771 gene encodes a novel T cell-specific adapter protein (TSAd) involved in the control of T cell activation.

Adenosine antagonists have been previously shown to be of benefit in some ischaemic and nephrotoxic models of acute renal failure (ARF). In the present study, the effects of three alkylxanthines with different potencies as adenosine antagonists 8-phenyltheophylline, theophylline and enprofylline, were examined in rats developing acute renal failure after 4 daily injections of gentamicin (200 mg kg-1). Renal function was assessed by biochemical (plasma urea and creatinine), functional (urine analysis and [3H]inulin and [14C]p-aminohippuric acid clearances) and morphological (degree of necrosis) indices. The various drug treatments produced improvements in some, but not all, measurements of renal function. However, any improvement produced by drug treatment was largely a result of a beneficial effect exerted by its vehicle (polyethylene glycol and NaOH). The lack of any consistent protective effect noted with the alkylxanthines tested in the present study indicates that adenosine plays little, if any, pathophysiological role in gentamicin-induced ARF.
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) are administered to patients to induce and control hypotension during anesthesia. SNP is authorized for clinical use in USA and UK, and ATP is clinically used in other countries such as Japan. We investigated how these two drugs act on the cardiovascular systems of 20 dogs whose hearts had been denervated by a procedure we had devised. ATP (10 dogs) or SNP (10 dogs) was administered to reduce mean arterial pressure by 30% to 70% of control. Before, during and after induced hypotension, we measured major cardiovascular parameters. Hypotension induced by ATP was accompanied by significant decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.001), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.001), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), total body oxygen consumption (p less than 0.05), and heart rate (p less than 0.001); all these variables returned normal within 30 min after ATP was stopped. Cardiac output did not change. During hypotension produced by SNP similar decreases were observed in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.01), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.01), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), and oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood (p less than 0.05), while heart rate (p less than 0.001) and cardiac output (p less than 0.05) were increased. Recoveries of heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were not shown within 60 min after SNP had been stopped. Both ATP and SNP should act on the pacemaker tissue of the heart.
Adequate timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C.
Administration of glucocorticoids induces ocular hypertension in some patients. If untreated, these patients can develop a secondary glaucoma that resembles primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). The underlying pathology of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma is not fully understood, due in part to lack of an appropriate animal model. Here, we developed a murine model of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma that exhibits glaucoma features that are observed in patients. Treatment of WT mice with topical ocular 0.1% dexamethasone led to elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP), functional and structural loss of retinal ganglion cells, and axonal degeneration, resembling glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma in human patients. Furthermore, dexamethasone-induced ocular hypertension was associated with chronic ER stress of the trabecular meshwork (TM). Similar to patients, withdrawal of dexamethasone treatment reduced elevated IOP and ER stress in this animal model. Dexamethasone induced the transcriptional factor CHOP, a marker for chronic ER stress, in the anterior segment tissues, and Chop deletion reduced ER stress in these tissues and prevented dexamethasone-induced ocular hypertension. Furthermore, reduction of ER stress in the TM with sodium 4-phenylbutyrate prevented dexamethasone-induced ocular hypertension in WT mice. Our data indicate that ER stress contributes to glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension and suggest that reducing ER stress has potential as a therapeutic strategy for treating glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma.
Administration of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine (1.5 or 2 mg/kg, i.v.) to rats elicited a marked decrease of mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) leading to death (in 67% or 90% of animals respectively). Intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist BN 52021 (10 mg/kg), 30 min before bupivacaine administration (2 mg/kg i.v.) suppressed both the decrease of MBP and HR. In contrast, doses of 1 mg/kg BN 52021 given 30 min before or 10 mg/kg administered 5 min before i.v. injection of bupivacaine were ineffective. When BN 52021 (20 mg/kg i.v.) was injected immediately after bupivacaine (2 mg/kg), a partial reversion of the decrease of MBP and HR was observed, whereas the dose of 10 mg/kg was ineffective. A partial recovery of bupivacaine-induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with BN 52021. Since the administration of BN 52021, at all doses studied, did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used, the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of BN 52021, a specific antagonist of PAF, against bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular toxicity. Thus, consistent with its direct effect on heart, PAF appears to be implicated in bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular alterations.
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a genetically determined disorder associated with progressive central demyelination and adrenal cortical insufficiency. All affected persons show increased levels of saturated unbranched very-long-chain fatty acids, particularly hexacosanoate (C26 0), because of impaired capacity to degrade these acids. This degradation normally takes place in a subcellular organelle called the peroxisome, and ALD, together with Zellwegers cerebrohepatorenal syndrome, is now considered to belong to the newly formed category of peroxisomal disorders. Biochemical assays permit prenatal diagnosis, as well as identification of most heterozygotes. We have identified 303 patients with ALD in 217 kindreds. These patients show a wide phenotypic variation. Sixty percent of patients had childhood ALD and 17% adrenomyeloneuropathy, both of which are X-linked, with the gene mapped to Xq28. Neonatal ALD, a distinct entity with autosomal recessive inheritance and points of resemblance to Zellwegers syndrome, accounted for 7% of the cases. Although excess C26 0 in the brain of patients with ALD is partially of dietary origin, dietary C26 0 restriction did not produce clear benefit. Bone marrow transplant lowered the plasma C26 0 level but failed to arrest neurological progression..
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an X-linked disease affecting 1/20, 000 males either as cerebral ALD in childhood or as adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) in adults. Childhood ALD is the more severe form, with onset of neurological symptoms between 5-12 years of age. Central nervous system demyelination progresses rapidly and death occurs within a few years. AMN is a milder form of the disease with onset at 15-30 years of age and a more progressive course. Adrenal insufficiency (Addisons disease) may remain the only clinical manifestation of ALD. The principal biochemical abnormality of ALD is the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) because of impaired beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. The normal oxidation of VLCFA-CoA in patients fibroblasts suggested that the gene coding for the VLCFA-CoA synthetase could be a candidate gene for ALD. Here we use positional cloning to identify a gene partially deleted in 6 of 85 independent patients with ALD. In familial cases, the deletions segregated with the disease. An identical deletion was detected in two brothers presenting with different clinical ALD phenotypes. Candidate exons were identified by computer analysis of genomic sequences and used to isolate complementary DNAs by exon connection and screening of cDNA libraries. The deduced protein sequence shows significant sequence identity to a peroxisomal membrane protein of M (r) 70K that is involved in peroxisome biogenesis and belongs to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters..
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), an X-linked inherited metabolic disorder, is the most frequent inborn peroxisomal disease. It leads to demyelination in the central and peripheral nervous system. Defective beta-oxidation of saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs; C22 0-C26 0) in peroxisomes has been shown to lead to an accumulation of VLCFAs in leukoid areas of the central nervous system, peripheral nerves, adrenal gland, and blood. The ALD gene has been recently identified and encodes a 745-amino-acid protein. We screened patients with adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy (ALD/AMN) from 20 kindreds for mutations in the ALD gene. Eleven missense and two nonsense mutations, five deletions, and one insertion were detected by direct sequencing of eight reverse transcribed fragments of the ALD-gene mRNA. Four mutations could be shown to be de novo. All mutations could be confirmed in carriers by sequencing genomic DNA. No correlation between the type of mutation and the severity of the phenotype could be observed. The mutations were not detected in the ALD gene of 30 healthy persons..
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), the most frequent peroxisomal disorder, is a severe neurodegenerative disease associated with an impairment of very long chain fatty acids beta-oxidation. We have recently identified by positional cloning the gene responsible for ALD, located in Xq28. It encodes a new member of the " ABC " superfamily of membrane-associated transporters that shows, in particular, significant homology to the 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70). We report here a detailed characterization of the ALD gene structure. It extends over 21 kb and consists of 10 exons. To facilitate the detection of mutations in ALD patients, we have determined the intronic sequences flanking the exons as well as the sequence of the 3 untranslated region and of the immediate 5 promoter region. Sequences present in distal exons cross-hybridize strongly to additional sequences in the human genome. The ALD gene has been positioned on a pulsed-field map between DXS15 and the L1CAM gene, about 650 kb upstream from the color pigment genes. The frequent occurrence of color vision anomalies observed in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (the adult onset form of ALD) thus does not represent a contiguous gene syndrome but a secondary manifestation of ALD..

Advanced glycosylation end products of proteins (AGEs) are nonenzymatically glycosylated proteins which accumulate in vascular tissue in aging and at an accelerated rate in diabetes. A approximately 35-kDa polypeptide with a unique NH2-terminal sequence has been isolated from bovine lung and found to be present on the surface of endothelial cells where it mediates the binding of AGEs (receptor for advanced glycosylation end product or RAGE). Using an oligonucleotide probe based on the amino-terminal sequence of RAGE, an apparently full-length cDNA of 1.5 kilobases was isolated from a bovine lung cDNA library. This cDNA encoded a 394 amino acid mature protein comprised of the following putative domains: an extracellular domain of 332 amino acids, a single hydrophobic membrane spanning domain of 19 amino acids, and a carboxyl-terminal domain of 43 amino acids. A partial clone encoding the human counterpart of RAGE, isolated from a human lung library, was found to be approximately 90% homologous to the bovine molecule. Based on computer analysis of the amino acid sequence of RAGE and comparison with databases, RAGE is a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules and shares significant homology with MUC 18, NCAM, and the cytoplasmic domain of CD20. Expression of the RAGE cDNA in 293 cells allowed them to bind 125I-AGE-albumin in a saturable and dose-dependent manner (Kd approximately 100 nM), blocked by antibody to RAGE. Western blots of 293 cells transfected with RAGE cDNA probed with anti-RAGE IgG demonstrated expression of immunoreactive protein compared to its absence in mock-transfected cells. These results suggest that RAGE functions as a cell surface receptor for AGEs, which could potentially mediate cellular effects of this class of glycosylated proteins.
Advances in the field of transplantation provide a better quality of life and allow more favorable conditions for growth and development in children. However, combinations of different therapeutic regimens require consideration of potential adverse reactions. We describe a 15-yr-old girl who had orthotopic liver transplantation because of Wilson's disease. Tacrolimus, MMF, and steroids were given as immunosuppressant. Lamivudine was added because of de nova hepatitis B infection during her follow-up. Three yr after transplantation she developed renal Fanconi syndrome with severe metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, glycosuria, and aminoaciduria. Although tacrolimus was suspected to be the cause of late post-transplant renal acidosis and was replaced by sirolimus, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalance got worse. Proximal muscle weakness has developed during her follow-up. Fanconi syndrome, as well as myopathy, is well recognized in patients with mitochondrial disorders and caused by depletion of mtDNA. We suggest that our patient's tubular dysfunction and myopathy may have resulted from mitochondrial dysfunction which is triggered by tacrolimus and augmented by lamivudine.

Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance. Thus, clinicians should address patients' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients' quality of life as well as overall health. The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics. Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, orthostatic hypotension, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain. The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of EPS, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, hepatic effects, lowered seizure threshold (primarily clozapine), and agranulocytosis (clozapine only). Since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals, the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual's dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient.

Adverse reactions to drugs are well recognized as a cause of acute or chronic urticaria, and angio-oedema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure, were introduced in Europe in the middle of the eighties, and the use of these drugs has increased progressively. Soon after the introduction of ACE inhibitors, acute bouts of angio-oedema were reported in association with the use of these drugs. We wish to draw attention to the possibility of adverse reactions to ACE inhibitors after long-term use and in patients with pre-existing angio-oedema.
After 180 min of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats, the effect of phenylephrine-induced hypertension on ischemic brain injury and blood-brain barrier permeability was determined. Blood pressure was manipulated by one of the following schedules during 120 min of reperfusion: Control, normotensive reperfusion; 90/hypertension (90/HTN), blood pressure was increased by 35 mm Hg during the initial 90 min of reperfusion only; 15/hypertension (15/HTN), normotensive reperfusion for 30 min followed by 15 min of hypertension and 75 min of normotension. Part A, for eight rats in each group brain injury was evaluated by staining tissue using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and edema was evaluated by microgravimetry. Part B, for eight different rats in each group blood-brain barrier permeability was evaluated by measuring the amount and extent of extravasation of Evans Blue dye. Brain injury (percentage of the ischemic hemisphere) was less in the 15/HTN group (16 +/- 6, mean +/- SD) versus the 90/HTN group (30 +/- 6), which was in turn less than the control group (42 +/- 5). Specific gravity was greater in the 15/HTN group (1.043 +/- 0.002) versus the 90/HTN (1.036 +/- 0.003) and control (1.037 +/- 0.003) groups. Evans Blue (mug g-1 of brain tissue) was greater in the 90/HTN group (24.4 +/- 6.0) versus the control group (12.3 +/- 4.1), which was in turn greater than the 15/HTN group (7.3 +/- 3.2). This study supports a hypothesis that during reperfusion, a short interval of hypertension decreases brain injury and edema; and that sustained hypertension increases the risk of vasogenic edema.
After a single oral dose of 4 mg/kg indomethacin (IDM) to sodium and volume depleted rats plasma renin activity (PRA) and systolic blood pressure fell significantly within four hours. In sodium repleted animals indomethacin did not change systolic blood pressure (BP) although plasma renin activity was decreased. Thus, indomethacin by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may diminish the blood pressure maintaining effect of the stimulated renin-angiotensin system in sodium and volume depletion.

Age of onset (AO) of Huntington disease (HD) is known to be correlated with the length of an expanded CAG repeat in the HD gene. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, in turn, is known to influence AO in Alzheimer disease, rendering the APOE gene a likely candidate to affect AO in other neurological diseases too. We therefore determined APOE genotype and normal CAG repeat length in the HD gene for 138 HD patients who were previously analysed with respect to CAG repeat length. Genotyping for APOE was performed blind to clinical information. In addition to highlighting the effect of the normal repeat length upon AO in maternally inherited HD and in male patients, we show that the APOE epsilon2epsilon3 genotype is associated with significantly earlier AO in males than in females. Such a sex difference in AO was not apparent for any of the other APOE genotypes. Our findings suggest that subtle differences in the course of the neurodegeneration in HD may allow interacting genes to exert gender specific effects upon AO.

Aggressive behaviors have been reported in patients who suffer from some psychiatric disorders, and are common in methamphetamine (METH) abusers. Herein, we report that multiple (but not single) injections of METH significantly increased aggressiveness in male CD-1 mice. This increase in aggressiveness was not secondary to METH-induced hyperactivity. Analysis of protein expression using antibody microarrays and Western blotting revealed differential changes in MAP kinase-related pathways after multiple and single METH injections. There were statistically significant (p<0.05) decreases in MEK1, Erk2p, GSK3alpha, 14-3-3e, and MEK7 in the striata of mice after multiple injections of METH. MEK1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of METH, but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of METH. In the frontal cortex, there was a statistically significant decrease in GSK3alpha after multiple (but not single) injections of METH. These findings suggest that alterations in MAP kinase-related pathways in the prefronto-striatal circuitries might be involved in the manifestation of aggressive behaviors in mice.

Alkaptonuria (AKU), the prototypic inborn error of metabolism, has recently been shown to be caused by loss of function mutations in the homogentisate-1, 2-dioxygenase gene (HGO). So far 17 mutations have been characterised in AKU patients of different ethnic origin. We describe three novel mutations (R58fs, R330S, and H371R) and one common AKU mutation (M368V), detected by mutational and polymorphism analysis of the HGO gene in five Finnish AKU pedigrees. The three novel AKU mutations are most likely specific for the Finnish population and have originated recently..
Alkaptonuria (AKU; McKusick no. 203500) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the lack of homogentisic acid oxidase activity. Patients excrete large amounts of homogentisic acid in their urine and a black ochronotic pigment is deposited in their cartilage and collagenous tissues. Ochronosis is the predominant clinical complication of the disease leading to ochronotic arthropathy, dark urine, pigment changes of the skin, and other clinical features. A mutation causing alkaptonuria in the mouse has mapped to chromosome 16. Considering conserved synteny, we were able to map the human gene to chromosome 3q in six alkaptonuria pedigrees of Slovak origin..
Alkaptonuria (aku), an inborn error of metabolism caused by the loss of homogentisate 1, 2-dioxygenase (HGD), has been described in a mouse model created by ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis but the mutation in these mice has not previously been identified. We used RT-PCR to amplify the Hgd cDNA from Hgd (aku)/Hgd (aku) mice. Two products shorter than the wild-type product were amplified. Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing were then used to identify the Hgd (aku) mouse mutation, found to be a single base change in a splice donor consensus sequence, causing exon skipping and frame-shifted products. This base change allowed us to create a non-radioactive genotyping assay for this allele.
All- trans-retinoic acid-induced erythema nodosum in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a component of standard therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is associated with potentially serious but treatable adverse effects involving numerous organ systems, including rare skeletal muscle involvement. Only a handful of cases of ATRA-induced myositis in children have been reported, and none in the radiology literature. We present such a case in a 15-year-old boy with APL, where recognition of imaging findings played a crucial role in making the diagnosis and facilitated prompt, effective treatment.

Alport syndrome with intellectual disability (ID) is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving several genes on Xq22.3 including COL4A5 and ACSL4. We report on a family with two males with this disorder and a Xq22.3 deletion. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and genomic analyses mapped the deletion region to between exon 1 of COL4A5 and exon 12 of ACSL4. The patients' mother has microscopic hematuria and was found to be heterozygous for the Xq22.3 deletion. Analysis using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of lymphoblastoid cell line RNA from an affected male in the family revealed a stable chimeric transcript with the ACSL4 exons 13-17 replaced by a cryptic exon from intron 1 of the COL4A5 gene. A truncated 54 kDa protein was predicted from this transcript but Western blot analysis and ACSL4 enzyme assay both showed functional nullisomy of ACSL4. We also compared the clinical features of the family with three previously reported families with the ACSL4 gene deletion and found that ID with absent or severely delayed speech, midface hypoplasia, and facial hypotonia are consistent features observed in the absence of ACSL4 gene.
Alstrom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinal degeneration, sensorineural hearing loss, early-onset obesity, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The gene for Alstrom syndrome (ALMS1) has been previously localized to human chromosome 2p13 by homozygosity mapping in two distinct isolated populations - French Acadian and North African. Pair-wise analyses resulted in maximum lod (logarithm of the odds ratio) scores of 3. 84 and 2. 9, respectively. To confirm these findings, a large linkage study was performed in twelve additional families segregating for Alstrom syndrome. A maximum two-point lod score of 7. 13 (theta = 0. 00) for marker D2S2110 and a maximum cumulative multipoint lod score of 9. 16 for marker D2S2110 were observed, further supporting linkage to chromosome 2p13. No evidence of genetic heterogeneity was observed in these families. Meiotic recombination events have localized the critical region containing ALMS1 to a 6. 1-cM interval flanked by markers D2S327 and D2S286. A fine resolution radiation hybrid map of 31 genes and markers has been constructed.
Alstrom syndrome: further evidence for linkage to human chromosome 2p13.
Alterations of ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 loci in early dysplastic lesions of head and neck: clinical and prognostic implications.
Alterations of norepinephrine transporter (NET) function by chronic inhibition of NET in relation to sensitization to seizures induce by cocaine and local anesthetics were studied in mice. Daily administration of desipramine, an inhibitor of the NET, for 5 days decreased [(3)H]norepinephrine uptake in the P2 fractions of hippocampus but not cortex, striatum or amygdalae. Co-administration of lidocaine, bupivacaine or tricaine with desipramine reversed this effect. Daily treatment of cocaine increased [(3)H]norepinephrine uptake into the hippocampus. Daily administration of desipramine increased the incidence of appearance of lidocaine-induced convulsions and decreased that of cocaine-induced convulsions. Co-administration of lidocaine with desipramine reversed the changes of convulsive activity of lidocaine and cocaine induced by repeated administration of desipramine. These results suggest that down-regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of desipramine may be relevant to desipramine-induced sensitization of lidocaine convulsions. Inhibition of Na(+) channels by local anesthetics may regulate desipramine-induced down-regulation of NET function. Repeated administration of cocaine induces up-regulation of hippocampal NET function. Desipramine-induced sensitization of lidocaine seizures may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of cocaine.
Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial (S-A) block was observed in a 57-year-old woman, under treatment for angina with 80 mg propranolol daily. The electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short P-P intervals and occasional pauses. These pauses were always preceded by the short P-P intervals and were usually followed by one or two P-P intervals of 0.92-0.95 s representing the basic sinus cycle. Following these basic sinus cycles, alternating rhythm started with the longer P-P interval. The long P-P intervals ranged between 1.04-1.12 s and the short P-P intervals between 0.80-0.84 s, respectively. The duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long P-P interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle. In one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2/1 S-A block was observed. This short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the P-P interval starting the alternative rhythm. There were small changes in the shape of the P waves and P-R intervals. S-A conduction through two pathways, the first with 2/1 block the second having 0.12-0.14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2/1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating P-P interval and other electrocardiographic features seen. Atropine 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all P-P intervals without changing the rhythm. The abnormal rhythm disappeared with the withdrawal of propranolol and when the drug was restarted a 2/1 S-A block was seen. This was accepted as evidence for propranolol being the cause of this conduction disorder.

Alternative splicing in the N-terminus of Alzheimer's presenilin 1.
Although 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) has been shown to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in animals and possibly humans, little is known about the long-term consequences of MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxic lesions on functions in which 5-HT is involved, such as cognitive function. Because 5-HT transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic 5-HT transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter promoter gene region (5-HTTLPR) when studying the effects of MDMA as well as cognitive functioning. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use on cognitive function, as well as the effects of long-term abstention from MDMA, in subjects genotyped for 5-HTTLPR. A second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males. Fifteen moderate MDMA users (<55 lifetime tablets), 22 heavy MDMA+ users (>55 lifetime tablets), 16 ex-MDMA+ users (last tablet > 1 year ago) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests. DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5-HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods.A significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks (p = 0.04) but not on reaction times (p = 0.61) or attention/executive functioning (p = 0.59). Heavy and ex-MDMA+ users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls. In contrast, no evidence of memory impairment was observed in moderate MDMA users. No significant effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender was observed. While the use of MDMA in quantities that may be considered "moderate" is not associated with impaired memory functioning, heavy use of MDMA use may lead to long lasting memory impairments. No effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender on memory function or MDMA use was observed.
Although CD34+ progenitor-derived immature dendritic cells (DCs) express CCR6, several recent studies reported that monocyte-derived immature DCs do not do so. We observed that DCs generated from monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4, and TGF-beta 1 consistently responded to liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha). These immature DCs expressed one class of high-affinity binding sites for LARC, and expressed both CCR6 mRNA and protein. Therefore, LARC-CCR6 interaction presumably also contributes to the regulation of trafficking of monocyte-derived DCs, and utilization of TGF-beta can potentially provide a ready source of CCR6+ monocyte-derived DCs for therapeutic purposes.
Although D-penicillamine has been used for many rheumatologic diseases, toxicity limits its usefulness in many patients. Polymyositis/dermatomyositis can develop as one of the autoimmune complications of D-penicillamine treatment, but its exact pathogenesis remains unclear. We report a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis, who developed polymyositis while receiving D-penicillamine therapy. We described the special clinical course of the patient. Patients receiving D-penicillamine therapy should be followed carefully for the development of autoimmune complications like polymyositis/dermatomyositis.
Although X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) affects 2%-3% of the human population, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Recent interest in this topic led to the identification of several genes for which mutations result in the disturbance of cognitive development. We identified a novel gene that is interrupted by an inv(X)(p21.1;q22) in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation. Molecular analysis of both breakpoint regions did not reveal an interrupted gene on Xp, but identified a novel nuclear RNA export factor (NXF) gene cluster, Xcen-NXF5-NXF2-NXF4-NXF3-Xqter, in which NXF5 is split by the breakpoint, leading to its functional nullisomy. The predicted NXF5 protein shows high similarity with the central part of the presumed mRNA nuclear export factor TAP/NXF1. Functional analysis of NXF5 demonstrates binding to RNA as well as to the RNA nuclear export-associated protein p15/NXT. In contrast to TAP/NXF1, overexpression studies localized NXF5 in the form of granules in the cell body and neurites of mature hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role in mRNA transport. The two newly identified mouse nxf homologs, nxf-a and nxf-b, which also map on X, show highest mRNA levels in the brain. A novel member of the nuclear RNA export factor family is absent in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation. Although we did not find direct evidence for the involvement of NXF5 in MR, the gene could be involved in development, possibly through a process in mRNA metabolism in neurons.
Although gastric cancer is the most common cancer in the world, genetic changes during its carcinogenesis are not well understood. Since some gastric cancers are considered to originate from the intestinal metaplasia, it is likely that the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, the mutation of which causes adenomatous polyps in the colon, is associated with carcinogenesis of gastric cancer. Based on this idea, DNAs isolated from gastric cancers were examined by means of a RNase protection analysis coupled with polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products. By screening nearly one-half of the coding region of the APC gene in 44 tumors, somatic mutations were detected in three tumors a missense mutation, a nonsense mutation, and a 5-base pair deletion resulting in a frame shift which causes truncation of the gene product. These results suggest that the mutation of the APC gene also plays an important role during the carcinogenesis of at least some gastric cancers..
Although herpesvirus saimiri-transformed T lymphocytes retain multiple normal T-cell functions, only a few changes have been described. By subtractive hybridization, we have isolated a novel cellular gene, ak155, a sequence homolog of the interleukin-10 gene. Specifically herpesvirus saimiri-transformed T cells overexpress ak155 and secrete the protein into the supernatant. In other T-cell lines and in native peripheral blood cells, but not in B cells, ak155 is transcribed at low levels. AK155 forms homodimers similarly to interleukin-10. As a lymphokine, AK155 may contribute to the transformed phenotype of human T cells after infection by herpesvirus saimiri.
Although indomethacin has been implicated as a possible cause of aplastic anemia on the basis of a few clinical observations, its role has not been definitely established. A case of fatal aplastic anemia is described in which no drugs other than allopurinol and indomethacin were given. Indomethacin was first given four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. A positive lymphocyte transformation test with indomethacin in vitro further substantiates the potential role of this drug in causing aplastic anemia in a susceptible patient. Fortunately, this seems to be a very rare complication.
Although neurotrophic factors were originally isolated on the basis of their ability to support the survival of neurons, these molecules are now thought to influence many aspects of the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Identifying the receptors for these neurotrophic factors should aid in identifying the cells on which these factors act and in understanding their precise mechanisms of action. A " tagged-ligand panning " procedure was used to clone a receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). This receptor is expressed exclusively within the nervous system and skeletal muscle. The CNTF receptor has a structure unrelated to the receptors utilized by the nerve growth factor family of neurotrophic molecules, but instead is most homologous to the receptor for a cytokine, interleukin-6. This similarity suggestes that the CNTF receptor, like the interleukin-6 receptor, requires a second, signal-transducing component. In contrast to all known receptors, the CNTF receptor is anchored to cell membranes by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage.
Although pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is often associated with systemic diseases, it has not been reported in association with congenital complement deficiencies. We describe an aggressive and ultimately fatal case of PG in a patient with a congenital C7 deficiency. Deficiencies of C7 can be associated with decreased neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and opsonization, similar to the immunologic abnormalities described in patients with PG. Our patients decreased complement level, if not directly related to the development of PG, may have contributed to the aggressive nature of her disease..
Although recent data established that a specific very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase is defective in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), the ALD gene is still unidentified. The ALD locus has been mapped to Xq28, like the red and green color pigment genes. Abnormal color vision has been observed in 12 of 27 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), a milder form of ALD. Furthermore, rearrangements of the color vision gene cluster were found in four of eight ALD kindreds. This led us to propose that a single DNA rearrangement could underlie both ALD and abnormal color vision in these patients. Study of 34 French ALD patients failed to reveal a higher than expected frequency of green/red visual pigment rearrangements 3 to the red/green color vision gene complex. The previous report of such rearrangements was based on small numbers and lack of knowledge that the frequency of " abnormal " color vision arrays on molecular analysis was twice as high as expected on the basis of the frequency of phenotypic color vision defects. The red/green color pigment (R/GCP) region was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 14 of these patients, and we did not find any fragment size difference between the patients and normal individuals who have the same number of pigment genes. The R/GCP region was also analyzed in 29 French and seven North American ALD patients by using six genomic DNA probes, isolated from a cosmid walk, that flank the color vision genes. No deletions were found with probes that lie 3 of the green pigment genes. One of the eight previously reported ALD individuals has a long deletion 5 of the red pigment gene, a deletion causing blue cone monochromacy. This finding and the previous findings of a 45% frequency of phenotypic color vision defects in patients with AMN may suggest that the ALD/AMN gene lies 5 to the red pigment gene and that the frequent phenotypic color vision anomalies owe their origin to deleted DNA that includes regulatory genes for color vision. It is possible, however, that phenotypic color vision anomalies in AMN may be phenocopies secondary to retinal or neural involvement by the disease. The single case of blue cone monochromacy may therefore be a fortuitous coincidence of two diseases..
Although several new anticoagulant drugs are in development, heparin remains the drug of choice for most anticoagulation needs. The clinical effects of heparin are meritorious, but side effects do exist. Important untoward effects of heparin therapy including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, heparin-associated osteoporosis, eosinophilia, skin reactions, allergic reactions other than thrombocytopenia and alopecia will be discussed in this article.
Although some studies have suggested fewer venous complications are associated with midazolam than with diazepam for endoscopic procedures, this variable has not been well documented. We prospectively evaluated the incidence of venous complications after intravenous injection of diazepam or midazolam in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Overall, venous complications were more frequent with diazepam (22 of 62 patients) than with midazolam (4 of 60 patients) (p < 0.001). A palpable venous cord was present in 23% (14 of 62) of patients in the diazepam group, compared with 2% (1 of 60 patients) in the midazolam group (p < 0.002). Pain at the injection site occurred in 35% (22 of 62) of patients in the diazepam group compared with 7% (4 of 60 patients) in the midazolam group (p < 0.001). Swelling and warmth at the injection site were not significantly different between the two groups. Smoking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, intravenous catheter site, dwell time of the needle, alcohol use, and pain during the injection had no effect on the incidence of venous complications.
Although statins are generally well-tolerated drugs, recent cases of drug-induced liver injury associated with their use have been reported. A 52-year-old Chinese man reported with liver damage, which appeared 12 hours after beginning treatment with fluvastatin. Patient presented with complaints of increasing nausea, anorexia, and upper abdominal pain. His laboratory values showed elevated creatine kinase and transaminases. Testing for autoantibodies was also negative. The liver biochemistries eventually normalized within 3 weeks of stopping the fluvastatin. Therefore, when prescribing statins, the possibility of hepatic damage should be taken into account.
Although suprofen has been associated with the development of acute renal failure in greater than 100 subjects, the mechanism of damage remains unclear. The direct nephrotoxic effects of a single dose of 15 mg of suprofen were compared in the recirculating isolated rat kidney perfused with cell-free buffer with or without the addition of 5 mg/dL of uric acid. There were no significant differences in renal sodium excretion, oxygen consumption, or urinary flow rates in kidneys perfused with suprofen compared with the drug-free control groups. In contrast, a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate was found after the introduction of suprofen to the kidney perfused with uric acid; no changes were found with suprofen in the absence of uric acid. A significant decrease in the baseline excretion rate of uric acid was found in rats given suprofen, compared with drug-free controls. However, the fractional excretion of uric acid was unchanged between the groups over the experimental period. In summary, suprofen causes acute declines in renal function, most likely by directly altering the intrarenal distribution of uric acid.
Although the United States Food and Drug Administration banned its use for nocturnal leg cramps due to lack of safety and efficacy, quinine is widely available in beverages including tonic water and bitter lemon. Numerous anecdotal reports suggest that products containing quinine may produce neurological complications, including confusion, altered mental status, seizures, and coma, particularly in older women. Psychologists need to inquire about consumption of quinine-containing beverages as part of an evaluation process.
Although the link between the BRCA1 tumour-suppressor gene and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer is established, the role, if any, of BRCA1 in non-familial cancers is unclear. BRCA1 mutations are rare in sporadic cancers, but loss of BRCA1 resulting from reduced expression or incorrect subcellular localization is postulated to be important in non-familial breast and ovarian cancers. Epigenetic loss, however, has not received general acceptance due to controversy regarding the subcellular localization of BRCA1 proteins, reports of which have ranged from exclusively nuclear, to conditionally nuclear, to the ER/golgi, to cytoplasmic invaginations into the nucleus. In an attempt to resolve this issue, we have comprehensively characterized 19 anti-BRCA1 antibodies. These reagents detect a 220-kD protein localized in discrete nuclear foci in all epithelial cell lines, including those derived from breast malignancies. Immunohistochemical staining of human breast specimens also revealed BRCA1 nuclear foci in benign breast, invasive lobular cancers and low-grade ductal carcinomas. Conversely, BRCA1 expression was reduced or undetectable in the majority of high-grade, ductal carcinomas, suggesting that absence of BRCA1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of a significant percentage of sporadic breast cancers..
Although the short-term safety (less than or equal to 6 months) of danazol has been established in a variety of settings, no information exists as to its long-term safety. We therefore investigated the long-term safety of danazol by performing a retrospective chart review of 60 female patients with hereditary angioedema treated with danazol for a continuous period of 6 months or longer. The mean age of the patients was 35.2 years and the mean duration of therapy was 59.7 months. Virtually all patients experienced one or more adverse reactions. Menstrual abnormalities (79%), weight gain (60%), muscle cramps/myalgias (40%), and transaminase elevations (40%) were the most common adverse reactions. The drug was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8 patients. No patient has died or suffered any apparent long-term sequelae that were directly attributable to the drug. We conclude that, despite a relatively high incidence of adverse reactions, danazol has proven to be remarkably safe over the long-term in this group of patients.
Although the study of imprinted genes in human development is very important, little is known about their expression and regulation in the early differentiation of human tissues due to lack of an appropriate model. In this study, a Chinese human embryonic stem (hES) cell line, SHhES1, was derived and fully characterized. Expression profiles of human imprinted genes were determined by Affymetrix Oligo micro-array in undifferentiated SHhES1 cells and SHhES1-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) at day 3, 8, 13 and 18. Thirty-two known human imprinted genes were detected in undifferentiated ES cells. Significantly, differential expression was found in nine genes at different stages of EB formation. Expression profile changes were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in SHhES1 cells as well as in another independently derived hES cell line, HUES-7. In addition, the monoallelic expressions of four imprinted genes were examined in three different passages of undifferentiated ES cells and EBs of both hES cell lines. The monoallelic expressions of imprinted genes, H19, PEG10, NDNL1 and KCNQ1 were maintained in both undifferentiated hES cells and derived EBs. More importantly, with the availability of maternal peripheral blood lymphocyte sample, we demonstrated that the maternal expression of KCNQ1 and the paternal expression of NDNL1 and PEG10 were maintained in SHhES1 cells. These data provide the first demonstration that the parental-specific expression of imprinted genes is stable in EBs after extensive differentiation, also indicating that in vitro fertilization protocol does not disrupt the parental monoallelic expression of the imprinted genes examined.
Although there have been anecdotal reports of cardiac toxicity associated with fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy, this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion. We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing 5-FU infusion for treatment of solid tumors in order to assess the incidence of ischemic ST changes. Patients were monitored for 23 +/- 4 hours before 5-FU infusion, and 98 +/- 9 hours during 5-FU infusion. Anginal episodes were rare: only one patient had angina (during 5-FU infusion). However, asymptomatic ST changes (greater than or equal to 1 mm ST deviation) were common: six of 25 patients (24%) had ST changes before 5-FU infusion v 17 (68%) during 5-FU infusion (P less than .002). The incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 +/- 0.02 prior to 5-FU infusion v 0.13 +/- 0.03 during 5-FU infusion (P less than .001); the duration of ECG changes was 0.6 +/- 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before 5-FU v 1.9 +/- 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during 5-FU (P less than .01). ECG changes were more common among patients with known coronary artery disease. There were two cases of sudden death, both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course. We conclude that 5-FU infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of ischemia, particularly among patients with coronary artery disease. The mechanism and clinical significance of these ECG changes remain to be determined.
Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer of striated muscle characterized in 60% of cases by a t (2; 13) (q35; q14). This results in the fusion of PAX3, a developmental transcription factor required for limb myogenesis, with FKHR, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. The resultant PAX3-FKHR gene possesses transforming properties; however, the effects of this chimeric oncogene on gene expression are largely unknown. To investigate the actions of these transcription factors, both Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR were introduced into NIH 3T3 cells, and the resultant gene expression changes were analyzed with a murine cDNA microarray containing 2, 225 elements. We found that PAX3-FKHR but not PAX3 activated a myogenic transcription program including the induction of transcription factors MyoD, Myogenin, Six1, and Slug as well as a battery of genes involved in several aspects of muscle function. Notable among this group were the growth factor gene Igf2 and its binding protein Igfbp5. Relevance of this model was suggested by verification that three of these genes (IGFBP5, HSIX1, and Slug) were also expressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. This study utilizes cDNA microarrays to elucidate the pattern of gene expression induced by an oncogenic transcription factor and demonstrates the profound myogenic properties of PAX3-FKHR in NIH 3T3 cells..
Amelioration of bendrofluazide-induced hypokalemia by timolol.
Amelogenins are an heterogenous family of proteins produced by ameloblasts of the enamel organ during tooth development. Disturbances of enamel formation occur in amelogenesis imperfecta, a clinically heterogenous group of inherited disorders characterised by defective enamel biomineralisation. An amelogenin gene, AMGX, has been mapped to the short of the X chromosome (Xp22. 1-p22. 3) and has been implicated in the molecular pathology of X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta (AIH1). We have identified three families exhibiting AIH1 and screened the AMGX gene for mutations using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. Three novel mutations were identified a C-T substitution in exon 5, and a G-T substitution and single cytosine deletion in exon 6, confirming the existence of extensive allelic heterogeneity in this condition. The identification of family-specific mutations will enable early identification of affected individuals and correlation of clinical phenotype with genotype will facilitate an objective system of disease classification.
Amikacin is an aminoglycoside commonly used to provide empirical double gram-negative treatment for febrile neutropenia and other suspected infections. Strategies of extended-interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population; however, data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology/oncology population. To evaluate amikacin-associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center. Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic/oncologic disorder that required treatment with an aminoglycoside were randomized to either conventional or extended-interval amikacin. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity by means of an increase in serum creatinine and evaluation of efficacy via amikacin serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended-interval groups, at 10% and 5%, respectively (P = 1.00). Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture, compared with none in the extended-interval group (P = 0.002). The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the two dosing regimens, but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups. Efficacy could not be assessed.
Amino acids 5 and 7, two potent and selective competitive GluR5 KA receptor antagonists, exhibited high GluR5 receptor affinity over other glutamate receptors. Their ester prodrugs 6 and 8 were orally active in three models of pain: reversal of formalin-induced paw licking, carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia, and capsaicin-induced mechanical hyperalgesia.
Amino-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin show selective accumulation in striatal neurons and synaptic toxicity.
Aminoglycoside antibiotics restore dystrophin function to skeletal muscles of mdx mice.
Aminopeptidase B (APB) is a Zn(2+)-metalloexopeptidase, which selectively removes Arg and/or Lys residues from the N-terminus of several peptide substrates. Several data strongly support the hypothesis that this enzyme could participate in the final stages of precursor processing mechanisms and/or in particular inflammatory processes and tumor developments. Therefore, we have cloned the complementary DNA encoding the human APB, a 658-residues protein, containing the canonical "HEXXH(X(18))E", a signature allowing its classification in the M1 family of metallopeptidases. The genomic structure of the human APB gene (rnpep; 1q32.1-q32.2) was also determined. rnpep is bracketed by pre-protein translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane gene and ETS family transcription factor ELF3 gene. It spans more than 24 kbp and contains 11 exons ranging from 109 to 574 bp. Finally, expression of the human APB messenger RNA (mRNA) was investigated using a pre-made dot-blot. This mRNA seems to be ubiquitous although its expression level varies depending of the cells or tissues considered.
Amiodarone and the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring permanent pacemaker in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation and prior myocardial infarction.
Amiodarone has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac tachyarrhythmias. The use of amiodarone has, however, been limited due to its serious side-effects. A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is given. It is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to amiodarone treatment, including steatosis, alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis of the liver. Patients receiving amiodarone should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels. Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of cholestatic injury or hepatomegaly.
Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug for life-threatening tachycardia, but various adverse effects have been reported. Reported herein is an autopsy case of valvular heart disease, in a patient who developed a lung mass (1.5 cm in diameter) and proteinuria (2.76 g/day) after treatment with amiodarone for a long time. The lung mass was highly suspected to be lung cancer on CT and positron emission tomography, but histologically the lesion was composed of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in alveolar walls and intra-alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages containing characteristic myelinoid bodies, indicating that it was an amiodarone-related lesion. In addition, the lung tissue had unevenly distributed hemosiderin deposition, and abnormally tortuous capillaries were seen in the mass and in heavily hemosiderotic lung portions outside the mass. In the kidneys, glomeruli had membrane spikes, prominent swelling of podocytes and subepithelial deposits, which were sometimes large and hump-like. Autoimmune diseases, viral hepatitis, malignant neoplasms or other diseases with a known relationship to membranous glomerulonephritis were not found. The present case highlights the possibility that differential diagnosis between an amiodarone-related pulmonary lesion and a neoplasm can be very difficult radiologically, and suggests that membranous glomerulonephritis might be another possible complication of amiodarone treatment.
Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side-effects, the most problematic being pneumonitis. The pulmonary toxicity of amiodarone is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell-mediated hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The clinical and radiographic features of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity are characteristic but nonspecific. The diagnosis depends on exclusion of other entities, such as heart failure, infection, and malignancy. While withdrawal of amiodarone leads to clinical improvement in majority of cases, this is not always possible or advisable. Dose reduction or concomitant steroid therapy may have a role in selected patients.
Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.
Amiodarone represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and maintenance of sinus rhythm. We briefly describe two patients suffering from recent-onset atrial fibrillation, who experienced an acute devastating low back pain a few minutes after initiation of intravenous amiodarone loading. Notably, this side effect has not been ever reported in the medical literature. Clinicians should be aware of this reaction since prompt termination of parenteral administration leads to complete resolution.
Amiodarone was administered to 154 patients who had sustained, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 118) or a cardiac arrest (n = 36) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. The loading dose was 800 mg/day for 6 weeks and the maintenance dose was 600 mg/day. Sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with amiodarone and had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +/- standard deviation 14.2 +/- 8.2). Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of VT and were successfully managed by continuing amiodarone at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug. One or more adverse drug reactions occurred in 51% of patients. Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of amiodarone in 41% and discontinuation of amiodarone in 10% of patients. The most common symptomatic adverse reactions were tremor or ataxia (35%), nausea and anorexia (8%), visual halos or blurring (6%), thyroid function abnormalities (6%) and pulmonary interstitial infiltrates (5%). Although large-dose amiodarone is highly effective in the long-term treatment of VT or VF refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, it causes significant toxicity in approximately 50% of patients. However, when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects, 75% of patients with VT or VF can be successfully managed with amiodarone.
Amiodarone, an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent, has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity in some patients. To gain insight into the mechanism of this unwanted effect, mice were administered various doses of amiodarone and examined for changes in hepatic histology and gene regulation. Amiodarone induced hepatomegaly, hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation, and a significant decrease in serum triglycerides and glucose. Northern blot analysis of hepatic RNA revealed a dose-dependent increase in the expression of a number of genes critical for fatty acid oxidation, lipoprotein assembly, and lipid transport. Many of these genes are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), a ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor. The absence of induction of these genes as well as hepatomegaly in PPARalpha knockout [PPARalpha-/-] mice indicated that the effects of amiodarone were dependent upon the presence of a functional PPARalpha gene. Compared to wild-type mice, treatment of PPARalpha-/- mice with amiodarone resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body weight loss. The inability of amiodarone to directly activate either human or mouse PPARalpha transiently expressed in human HepG2 hepatoma cells indicates that the effects of amiodarone on the function of this receptor were indirect. Based upon these results, we conclude that amiodarone disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis and that the increased expression of PPARalpha target genes is secondary to this toxic effect. These results provide important new mechanistic information regarding the hepatotoxic effects of amiodarone and indicate that PPARalpha protects against amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity.

Ammonia coma was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1.7 mmol NH4CL. This coma was prevented with 1.68 mmol L-dopa given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the ammonium salt injection. The effect of L-dopa was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain ammonia, an increase in brain dopamine, and an increase in renal excretion of ammonia and urea. Intraventricular infusion of dopamine sufficient to raise the brain dopamine to the same extent did not prevent the ammonia coma nor affect the blood and brain ammonia concentrations. Bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of L-dopa on blood and brain ammonia and the ammonia coma was not prevented. Thus, the reduction in blood and brain ammonia and the prevention of ammonia coma after L-dopa, can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of dopamine on renal function rather than its central action. These results provide a reasonable explanation for the beneficial effects observed in some encephalopathic patients receiving L-dopa.
Amnesia produced by scopolamine and cycloheximide were reversed by morphine given 30 min before the test trial (pre-test), and pre-test morphine also facilitated the memory retrieval in the animals administered naloxone during the training trial. Similarly, pre-test scopolamine partially reversed the scopolamine-induced amnesia, but not significantly; and pre-test cycloheximide failed to reverse the cycloheximide-induced amnesia. These results suggest that the facilitation of memory retrieval by pre-test morphine might be the direct action of morphine rather than a state dependent effect.
Amnestic syndrome associated with propranolol toxicity: a case report.
Among 3,129 dobutamine stress echocardiographic studies, a hypertensive response, defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) > or = 220 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP > or = 110 mm Hg, occurred in 30 patients (1%). Patients with this response more often had a history of hypertension and had higher resting systolic and diastolic BP before dobutamine infusion.
Among 547 preterm infants of < or = 34 weeks gestation born between 1987 and 1991, 8 children (1.46%) developed severe progressive and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Perinatal risk factors of infants with hearing loss were compared with those of two control groups matched for gestation and birth weight and for perinatal complications. Our observations demonstrated an association of hearing loss with a higher incidence of perinatal complications. Ototoxicity appeared closely related to a prolonged administration and higher total dose of ototoxic drugs, particularly aminoglycosides and furosemide. Finally, we strongly recommend to prospectively and regularly perform audiologic assessment in sick preterm children as hearing loss is of delayed onset and in most cases bilateral and severe.
Among the common side effects of diphenylhydantoin (DPH) overdose, the most frequently encountered neurological signs are those of cerebellar dysfunction. Very rarely, the toxic neurological manifestations of this drug are of cerebral origin. Two patients are presented who suffered progressive hemiparesis due to DPH overdose. Both had brain surgery before DPH treatment. It is assumed that patients with some cerebral damage are liable to manifest DPH toxicity as focal neurological signs.
Among various oral antiplatelets, a combination of a novel prostacyclin analogue beraprost (BPT) and a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol (CLZ) may result in untoward clinical effects due to possible synergistic elevation of intracellular cAMP (cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate). Thereby, a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted. Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take BPT/CLZ in the following schedule; BPT: 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t.i.d. from day 7 to 14, CLZ: 200 mg t.i.d. from day 3 to 14. At various time intervals, physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo platelet aggregation and determination of intraplatelet cAMP were performed. Throughout the observation period, no significant alteration in vital signs was observed. Seven out of 12 subjects experienced headache of a short duration accompanying facial flush in one and nausea in one, especially after ingestion of CLZ. All of these symptoms, probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents, were of mild degree and no special treatment was required. Intraplatelet cAMP content was gradually but significantly increased to 9.84 +/- 4.59 pmol per 10(9) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value (6.87 +/- 2.25 pmol). The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted. In conclusion, the combined administration of BPT/CLZ is safe at doses used in the study, though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated.

An 11-year-old boy was given halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen, pancuronium 0.4 mg and suxamethonium 100 mg for induction of anaesthesia. In response to this a marked jaw stiffness occurred which lasted for two minutes and the anaesthesia were terminated. Four hours of apnoea ensued and he suffered generalized severe myalgia lasting for one week. He was found to have atypical plasma cholinesterase with a dibucaine number of 12, indicating homozygocity. This was verified by study of the family. The case shows that prolonged jaw rigidity and myalgia may occur after suxamethonium in patients with atypical cholinesterase despite pretreatment with pancuronium.
An 80 year old diabetic male with evidence of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy was admitted with chest pain. He was found to have atrial flutter at a ventricular rate of 70/min which slowed down to 30-40/min when nifedipine (60 mg) in 3 divided doses, during which he was paced at a rate of 70/min. This is inconsistent with the well-established finding that nifedipine induces tachycardia in normally innervated hearts. However, in hearts deprived of compensatory sympathetic drive, it may lead to bradycardia.
An 80-yr-old man developed acute hepatitis shortly after ingesting oral ceftriaxone. Although the transaminases gradually returned to baseline after withholding the beta lactam antibiotic, there was a gradual increase in serum bilirubin and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration caused by an autoimmune hemolytic anemia and erythroblastocytopenia. These responded to systemic steroids and immunoglobulins. Despite the widespread use of these agents this triad of side effects has not previously been reported in connection with beta lactam antibiotics.
An 82-year-old man with treatment-resistant depression and early Alzheimer's disease was started on methylphenidate. Significant obsessive-compulsive behavior ensued but diminished over several weeks when methylphenidate was replaced by fluvoxamine. The patient had no prior psychiatric history, but he had a sister with obsessive-compulsive disorder. It appears that methylphenidate precipitated the patient's pathological behavior.
An 84-year-old male received oral pilsicainide, a pure sodium channel blocker with slow recovery kinetics, to convert his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to a sinus rhythm; the patient developed sudden cardiac death two days later. The Holter electrocardiogram, which was worn by chance, revealed torsade de pointes with gradually prolonged QT intervals. This drug is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and most of it is excreted from the kidney. Although the patient's renal function was not highly impaired and the dose of pilsicainide was low, the plasma concentration of pilsicainide may have been high, which can produce torsades de pointes in the octogenarian. Although the oral administration of class IC drugs, including pilsicainide, is effective to terminate atrial fibrillation, careful consideration must be taken before giving these drugs to octogenarians.

An abbreviated Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS-R) was used to assess verbal and arithmetical cognitive performance in 55 subjects with myotonic dystrophy (DM), covering all grades of disease severity, and 31 controls at 50% risk of inheriting DM. Scaled scores from the assessment were converted into an intelligence quotient (IQ) estimation on each person. Significant IQ differences were found between (1) all 55 DM subjects (mean 90. 2, SD 16. 1) and 31 controls (102. 6, SD 9. 4), with no sex differences in either group; (2) 15 affected parents (99. 3, SD 12. 2) and their affected children (88. 1, SD 17. 2), where significance was dependent on parental sex being female; and (3) 15 pairs of affected sibs (89. 6, SD 13. 2) and their normal sibs (100. 2, SD 7. 6). IQ steadily declined as (1) the age of onset of signs and symptoms decreased, and (2) the CTG expansion size increased. The correlation appeared to be more linear with age of onset. The correlation of IQ difference and CTG expansion difference in both the DM parent-child pairs and normal sib-affected sib pairs was poor, indicating that CTG expansion is not a reliable predictor of IQ either in individual persons or families. Further analysis of cognitive function in DM is required to clarify specific deficits characteristic of this patient group
An acyl-CoA hydrolase, referred to as hBACH, was purified from human brain cytosol. The enzyme had a molecular mass of 100 kDa and 43-kDa subunits, and was highly active with long-chain acyl-CoAs, e.g. a maximal velocity of 295 micromol/min/mg and K(m) of 6.4 microM for palmitoyl-CoA. Acyl-CoAs with carbon chain lengths of C(8-18) were also good substrates. In human brain cytosol, 85% of palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity was titrated by an anti-BACH antibody, which accounted for over 75% of the enzyme activity found in the brain tissue. The cDNA isolated for hBACH, when expressed in Escherichia coli, directed the expression of palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity and a 44-kDa protein immunoreactive to the anti-BACH antibody, which in turn neutralized the hydrolase activity. The hBACH cDNA encoded a 338-amino acid sequence which was 95% identical to that of a rat homolog. The hBACH gene spanned about 130 kb and comprised 9 exons, and was mapped to 1p36.2 on the cytogenetic ideogram. These findings indicate that the long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase present in the brain is well conserved between man and the rat, suggesting a conserved role for this enzyme in the mammalian brain, and enabling genetic studies on the functional analysis of acyl-CoA hydrolase.
An allergic reaction consisting of angioneurotic edema secondary to continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil occurred in a patient with recurrent carcinoma of the oral cavity, cirrhosis, and cisplatin-induced impaired renal function. This reaction occurred during the sixth and seventh courses of infusional chemotherapy. Oral diphenhydramine and prednisone were ineffective in preventing the recurrence of the allergic reaction. Discontinuance of effective chemotherapy in this patient during partial remission resulted in fatal disease progression.
An allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) from a normal HLA identical sibling donor was performed in a 13-year-old boy with rapidly progressive adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Engraftment and complete hematologic recovery occurred within 4 weeks, but neurologic deterioration continued. The patient died of an adenovirus infection 141 days after BMT. ALD is characterized by abnormally high plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) as a result of impaired capacity to degrade them. Ten days after BMT, the white blood cell VLCFA levels and enzyme activity became normal; after 3 months, there was progressive reduction of plasma VLCFA to levels only slightly above normal..
An amino-acid substitution involved in phenylketonuria is in linkage disequilibrium with DNA haplotype 2.
An analysis is presented of 220 cases of possible neurotoxic reactions to halogenated hydroxyquinolines reported from outside Japan. In 80 cases insufficient information was available for adequate comment and in 29 a relationship to the administration of clioquinol could be excluded. Of the remainder, a relationship to clioquinol was considered probable in 42 and possible in 69 cases. In six of the probable cases the neurological disturbance consisted of an acute reversible encephalopathy usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of clioquinol over a short period. The most common manifestation, observed in 15 further cases, was isolated optic atrophy. This was most frequently found in children, many of whom had received clioquinol as treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica. In the remaining cases, a combination of myelopathy, visual disturbance, and peripheral neuropathy was the most common manifestation. Isolated myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy, or these manifestations occurring together, were infrequent. The onset of all manifestations (except toxic encephalopathy) was usually subacute, with subsequent partial recovery. Older subjects tended to display more side effects. The full syndrome of subacute myelo-optic neuropathy was more frequent in women, but they tended to have taken greater quantities of the drug.
An animal model for Norrie disease (ND): gene targeting of the mouse ND gene.
An antibody against the synthetic C-terminal peptides deduced from the cDNA of the gene responsible for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) was produced to characterize the product of the ALD gene. The antibody reacted with the 80 kDa band protein in control fibroblasts, while no bands were detected in the fibroblasts from a patient with ALD (# 163), in which mRNA of the ALD gene was undetectable based on Northern blot analysis. The 293T cells transfected with the full-coding cDNA inserted in the expression vector produced a new 80 kDa protein, as detected by Western blot. In an immunocytological study, the staining was in a punctate pattern, in the normal fibroblasts. However, there was no punctate staining in the # 163 cells. These data thus indicate that the ALD gene encodes an 80 kDa membrane protein..
An arylsulfatase A (ARSA) missense mutation (T274M) causing late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy.
An elderly patient treated with low dose Desipramine developed a delirium while her plasma level was in the "subtherapeutic" range. Delirium, which may be induced by tricyclic drug therapy in the elderly, can be caused by tricyclics with low anticholinergic potency. Therapeutic ranges for antidepressants that have been derived from general adult population studies may not be appropriate for the elderly. Further studies of specifically elderly patients are now required to establish safer and more appropriate guidelines for drug therapy.
An elderly woman developed an Alzheimer-like subacute dementia as a result of propranolol toxicity. Analysis of the manifestations showed that severe impairment of memory accounted for virtually all of the abnormalities. There is evidence that cerebral reactions to drug toxicity can exhibit patterns that suggest highly selective involvement of functional subdivisions of the brain.

An exon representing a novel clathrin heavy chain gene (CLTCL) was isolated during gene identification studies and transcription mapping of human chromosome 22. Isolation and sequencing of cDNA clones corresponding to this exon revealed extensive similarity of the predicted amino acid sequence of this gene product to those of clathrin heavy chain genes of other species. Northern blot analysis has revealed an apparent developmental expression pattern of an approximately 6-kb mRNA. The gene appears to be expressed ubiquitously in the limited number of fetal tissues that were tested, but is selectively expressed in certain adult tissues, particularly in skeletal muscle. In addition, alternative splicing of an exon was observed near the carboxyl terminus of the predicted gene product. Its location overlaps the domain putatively involved in clathrin light chain binding and is adjacent to the heavy chain self-assembly (or trimerization) region, suggesting that alternative splicing may be involved in regulating one or both of these interactions. The expression pattern of this gene, in addition to its potential role in receptor-mediated endocytosis and signal transduction, suggests that it may be important in some developmental processes. The location of CLTCL on human chromosome 22 near the region commonly deleted in DiGeorge and other apparent haploinsufficiency syndromes warrants further investigation into its relationship with these developmental disorders.
An experiment was performed to test whether inclusion of phenobarbital in a choline-devoid diet would increase the hepatocarcinogenicity of the diet. Groups of 5-week old male Fischer-344 rats were fed for 7-25 months semipurified choline-devoid or choline-supplemented diets, containing or not 0.06% phenobarbital. No hepatic preneoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinomas developed in rats fed the plain choline-supplemented diet, while one preneoplastic nodule and one hepatocellular carcinoma developed in two rats fed the same diet containing phenobarbital. The incidence of preneoplastic nodules and of hepatocellular carcinomas was 10% and 37%, respectively, in rats fed the plain choline-devoid diet, and 17% and 30%, in rats fed the phenobarbital-containing choline-devoid diet. The results evinced no enhancement of the hepatocarcinogenicity of the choline-devoid diet by phenobarbital. Sporadic neoplastic lesions were observed in organs other than the liver of some of the animals, irrespective of the diet fed.
An experimental model of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) was developed in rats by the combined administration of puromycin-aminonucleoside (AMNS) and protamine sulfate (PS). Male Sprague-Dawley rats, uninephrectomized three weeks before, received daily injections of subcutaneous AMNS (1 mg/100 g body wt) and intravenous PS (2 separated doses of 2.5 mg/100 g body wt) for four days. The series of injections were repeated another three times at 10 day intervals. The animals were sacrificed on days 24, 52, and 80. They developed nephrotic syndrome and finally renal failure. The time-course curve of creatinine clearance dropped and showed significant difference (P less than 0.01) from that of each control group, such as, AMNS alone, PS alone or saline injected. Their glomeruli showed changes of progressive FSGS. The ultrastructural studies in the initial stage revealed significant lack of particles of perfused ruthenium red on the lamina rara externa and marked changes in epithelial cell cytoplasm. Therefore, it is suggested that the administration of PS enhances the toxicity of AMNS on the glomerulus and readily produces progressive FSGS in rats resulting in the end-stage renal disease.
An extremely rare case of delusional parasitosis in a chronic hepatitis C patient during pegylated interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin treatment.
An increase in blood pressure, accompanied by atrial fibrillation, agitation, incomprehensible shouts and loss of consciousness, was observed in an elderly, ASA classification group II, cardiovascularly medicated male, 12 min after performance of axillary block with mepivacaine 850 mg containing adrenaline 0.225 mg, for correction of Dupuytren's contracture. After intravenous administration of labetalol, metoprolol and midazolam the patient's condition improved, and 15 min later he woke up. The block was successful and surgery was conducted as scheduled despite persisting atrial fibrillation. Postoperatively, the patient refused DC cardioversion and was treated medically. Both the temporal relationship of events and the response to treatment suggest that a rapid systemic absorption of mepivacaine with adrenaline and/or interaction of these drugs with the patient's cardiovascular medications were responsible for the perioperative complications.

An investigation was undertaken to determine the dosage of etomidate required to maintain sleep in adults undergoing surgery under regional local anesthesia. Premedication of diazepam 10 mg and atropine 0.5 mg was given, and sleep was induced and maintained by intermittent intravenous injections of etomidate 0.1/mg/kg, given whenever the patient would open his eyes on request. A mean overall dose of etomidate 17.4 microgram/kg/min. was required to maintain sleep, but great individual variation occurred, with older patients requiring less drug. The investigation was discontinued after 18 patients because of the frequency and intensity of side-effects, particularly pain and myoclonia, which caused the technique to be abandoned in two cases. It is considered unlikely that etomidate will prove to be the hypnotic of choice for a totally intravenous anesthetic technique in adults because of the high incidence of myoclonia after prolonged administration. In several patients uncontrollable muscle movements persisted for many minutes after complete recovery of consciousness.
An obligate carrier of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) who was also heterozygous for the A and B types of X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was found. With her it became possible to determine whether allelic exclusion occurs in particular cell-types of the WAS carrier. If so, the remaining cells of a particular cell-type would express only the normal X chromosome and only one glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzyme would be demonstrable. This carrier had only the B isoenzyme of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in platelets and thymus-derived T lymphocytes, although both isoenzymes A and B were present in erythrocytes and neutrophils. These findings suggest that selection against the WAS gene occurs in platelets and thymus-derived T lymphocytes and that the defects associated with WAS expressed in these cell-types may be implicated in the genesis of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome..

Analbuminemia in a neonate.
Analbuminemia in an American Indian girl.
Analbuminemia was fortuitously detected in a nonedematous 12-year-old American Indian girl with atopic dermatitis, mild bronchial asthma, a mild seizure disorder, and hyperlipoproteinemia with a corneal arcus. Immunologic methods revealed trace amounts (17 mg/100 ml) of apparently normal serum albumin. The patients parents were remotely related. The pedigree and clinical findings were compatible with autosomal recessive transmission of analbuminemia. Heterozygotes had subnormal levels of serum albumin. The Gc-locus is closely linked to the structural albumin locus. Gc-protein levels were normal in the patient and together with normal chromosomal banding studies make it unlikely that a chromosomal deletion caused analbuminemia. Gc-types in the family were compatible with, but did not prove, linkage of analbuminemia to the Gc-locus. These findings suggest a " thalassemia " -like mutation for this disorder..

Analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is a valuable approach for characterizing proteins of unknown function. Here, we have developed a strategy combining library and matrix yeast two-hybrid screens to generate a highly connected PPI network for Huntington's disease (HD). The network contains 186 PPIs among 35 bait and 51 prey proteins. It revealed 165 new potential interactions, 32 of which were confirmed by independent binding experiments. The network also permitted the functional annotation of 16 uncharacterized proteins and facilitated the discovery of GIT1, a G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein, which enhances huntingtin aggregation by recruitment of the protein into membranous vesicles. Coimmunoprecipitations and immunofluorescence studies revealed that GIT1 and huntingtin associate in mammalian cells under physiological conditions. Moreover, GIT1 localizes to neuronal inclusions, and is selectively cleaved in HD brains, indicating that its distribution and function is altered during disease pathogenesis.

Analysis of the age incidence curves for unilateral and bilateral retinoblastoma led Knudson to propose that hereditary tumours may arise by a single event and sporadic tumours by a two stage mutation process. It has been suggested recently that sporadic renal cell carcinoma may arise from a two stage mutation process. We analysed the age incidence curves for symptomatic renal cell carcinoma (n = 26) and cerebellar haemangioblastoma (n = 68) in 109 patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, and compared them to 104 patients with sporadic renal cell carcinoma and 43 patients with sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma. The age incidence curves for renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma in VHL disease were compatible with a single mutation model, whereas the age incidence curves for sporadic renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma suggested a two stage mutation process. These data are compatible with the VHL gene functioning as a recessive tumour suppressor gene. Sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma and some renal cell carcinoma may arise from somatic mutations inactivating both alleles at the VHL locus..
Anencephaly has been suggested to develop from exencephaly; however, there is little direct experimental evidence to support this, and the mechanism of transformation remains unclear. We examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid- to late-gestation mouse embryos. We observed the exencephaly induced by 5-azacytidine at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), let the embryos develop exo utero until E18.5, and re-observed the same embryos at E18.5. We confirmed several cases of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly. However, in many cases, the exencephalic brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period. To analyze the transformation patterns, we classified the exencephaly by size and shape of the exencephalic tissue into several types at E13.5 and E18.5. It was found that the transformation of exencephalic tissue was not simply size-dependent, and all cases of anencephaly at E18.5 resulted from embryos with a large amount of exencephalic tissue at E13.5. Microscopic observation showed the configuration of exencephaly at E13.5, frequent hemorrhaging and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the exencephalic head at E15.5, and multiple modes of reduction in the exencephalic tissue at E18.5. From observations of the vasculature, altered distribution patterns of vessels were identified in the exencephalic head. These findings suggest that overgrowth of the exencephalic neural tissue causes the altered distribution patterns of vessels, subsequent peripheral circulatory failure and/or hemorrhaging in various parts of the exencephalic head, leading to the multiple modes of tissue reduction during transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly.
Angelman syndrome (AS) is caused by chromosome 15q11-q13 deletions of maternal origin, by paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) 15, by imprinting defects, and by mutations in the UBE3A gene. UBE3A encodes a ubiquitin-protein ligase and shows brain-specific imprinting. Here we describe UBE3A coding-region mutations detected by SSCP analysis in 13 AS individuals or families. Two identical de novo 5-bp duplications in exon 16 were found. Among the other 11 unique mutations, 8 were small deletions or insertions predicted to cause frameshifts, 1 was a mutation to a stop codon, 1 was a missense mutation, and 1 was predicted to cause insertion of an isoleucine in the hect domain of the UBE3A protein, which functions in E2 binding and ubiquitin transfer. Eight of the cases were familial, and five were sporadic. In two familial cases and one sporadic case, mosaicism for UBE3A mutations was detected in the mother of three AS sons, in the maternal grandfather of two AS first cousins, and in the mother of an AS daughter. The frequencies with which we detected mutations were 5 (14%) of 35 in sporadic cases and 8 (80%) of 10 in familial cases..
Angina and ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred after administration of oral dipyridamole in four patients awaiting urgent myocardial revascularization procedures. To our knowledge, this has not previously been reported as a side effect of preoperative dipyridamole therapy, although dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia has been demonstrated to occur in animals and humans with coronary artery disease. Epicardial coronary collateral vessels were demonstrated in all four patients; a coronary "steal" phenomenon may be the mechanism of the dipyridamole-induced ischemia observed.

Angioedema, also known as angioneurotic edema or Quincke's disease, is a well-demarcated, localized edema involving the subcutaneous tissues that may cause upper-airway obstruction. We report the case of a previously healthy 19-year-old man with no known drug allergies in whom angioedema with significant tongue swelling and protrusion developed within 10 minutes of the administration of a single IV dose of droperidol.
Angiosarcoma of the liver associated with diethylstilbestrol.
Angiosarcoma of the liver occurred in a 76-year-old man who had been treated for a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the liver with diethylstilbestrol for 13 years. Angiosarcoma was also present within pulmonary and renal arteries. The possibility that the intraarterial lesions might represent independent primary tumors is considered.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema of the stomach and small intestine: a case report.
Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) is a human genetic disorder of impaired ectodermal appendage development. The EDA gene encodes isoforms of a novel transmembrane protein, ectodysplasin. The sequence of the longest isoform includes an interrupted collagenous domain of 19 Gly-X-Y repeats and a motif conserved in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related ligand family. In order to understand better the function of the ectodysplasin protein molecule and its domains, we have studied the processing and localization of wild-type and mutated isoforms in transfected human fetal kidney 293 and monkey kidney COS-1 cells. Similar to other members of collagenous membrane proteins and members of TNF-related ligands, ectodysplasin is a type II membrane protein and it forms trimers. The membrane localization of ectodysplasin is asymmetrical: it is found on the apical and lateral surfaces of the cells where it co-localizes with cytoskeletal structures. The TNF-like motif and cysteines found near the C-terminus are necessary for correct transport to the cell membrane, but the intracellular and collagenous domains are not required for the localization pattern. Our results suggest that ectodysplasin is a new member in the TNF-related ligand family involved in the early epithelial-mesenchymal interaction that regulates ectodermal appendage formation.

Aniridia (iris hypoplasia) is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder of the eye. Mutations in the human aniridia (PAX6) gene have now been identified in many patients from various ethnic groups. In the study reported here we describe PAX6 mutations in one sporadic and five familial cases with aniridia. Of the four different mutations identified, one was identical to a previously reported mutation (C-- > T transition at codon 240), and three were novel two in the glycine-rich region and one in the proline/serine/threonine-rich (PST) region. One PAX6 mutation found in the PST region was associated with cataracts in an aniridia family. Another splice mutation in the PST domain occurred in an aniridia patient with anosmia (inability to smell). The six new aniridia cases reported here have mutations predicted to generate incomplete PAX6 proteins. These results support the theory that human aniridia is caused by haploinsufficiency of PAX6..
Aniridia in man and Small eye in mice are semidominant developmental disorders caused by mutations within the paired box gene PAX6. Whereas heterozygotes suffer from iris hypoplasia, homozygous mice lack eyes and nasal cavities and exhibit brain abnormalities. To investigate the role of gene dosage in more detail, we have generated yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice carrying the human PAX6 locus. When crossed onto the Small eye background, the transgene rescues the mutant phenotype. Strikingly, mice carrying multiple copies on a wild-type background show specific developmental abnormalities of the eye, but not of other tissues expressing the gene. Thus, at least five different eye phenotypes are associated with changes in PAX6 expression. We provide evidence that not only reduced, but also increased levels of transcriptional regulators can cause developmental defects..
Aniridia is a congenital malformation of the eye, chiefly characterised by iris hypoplasia, which can cause blindness. The PAX6 gene was isolated as a candidate aniridia gene by positional cloning from the smallest region of overlap of aniridia-associated deletions. Subsequently PAX6 intragenic mutations were demonstrated in Smalleye, a mouse mutant which is an animal model for aniridia, and six human aniridia patients. In this paper we describe four additional PAX6 point mutations in aniridia patients, both sporadic and familial. These mutations highlight regions of the gene which are essential for normal PAX6 function. In addition, the frequency at which we have found PAX6 mutations suggests that lesions in PAX6 will account for most cases of aniridia..
Aniridia-associated cytogenetic rearrangements suggest that a position effect may cause the mutant phenotype.
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common and highly familial rheumatic disorder. The sibling recurrence risk ratio for the disease is 63 and heritability assessed in twins > 90%. Although MHC genes, including HLA-B27, contribute only 20-50% of the genetic risk for the disease, no non-MHC gene has yet been convincingly demonstrated to influence either susceptibility to the disease or its phenotypic expression. Previous linkage and association studies have suggested the presence of a susceptibility gene for AS close to, or within, the cytochrome P450 2D6 gene (CYP2D6, debrisoquine hydroxylase) located at chromosome 22q13.1. We performed a linkage study of chromosome 22 in 200 families with AS affected sibling-pairs. Association of alleles of the CYP2D6 gene was examined by both case-control and within-family means. For case-control studies, 617 unrelated individuals with AS (361 probands from sibling-pair and parent-case trio families and 256 unrelated non-familial sporadic cases) and 402 healthy ethnically matched controls were employed. For within-family association studies, 361 families including 161 parent-case trios and 200 affected sibling-pair families were employed. Homozygosity for poor metabolizer alleles was found to be associated with AS. Heterozygosity for the most frequent poor metabolizer allele (CYP2D6*4) was not associated with increased susceptibility to AS. Significant within-family association of CYP2D6*4 alleles and AS was demonstrated. Weak linkage was also demonstrated between CYP2D6 and AS. We postulate that altered metabolism of a natural toxin or antigen by the CYP2D6 gene may increase susceptibility to AS.
Ankylosing spondylitis is diagnosed once or twice in each 1000 males and one tenth as frequently in females, but the true prevalence is unknown. Indentification of genetic marker, HL-A W27, for susceptible persons has provided a tool facilitating epidemiologic studies and allowing identification of " control " populations without the marker. Evaluation by postal questionnaires, and pelvic radiography of 78 HL-A 27W-positive blood donors selected from a group of apparently healthy subjects revealed 14 who satisfied the criteria for definite ankylosing spondylitis. The prevalence was similar in both sexes. One hundred and twenty-six W27-negative controls matched for race, sex, and age failed to yield a single case. For a person of either sex with HL-A W27, there appears to be about a 20 per cent chance that ankylosing spondylitis will develop, suggesting a prevalence of 10 to 15 per thousand. Hitherto accepted figures may underestimate the frequency by a factor of 10 to 20..

Antagonists at serotonin type 6 (5-HT(6)) receptors show activity in models of learning and memory. Although the underlying mechanism(s) are not well understood, these effects may involve an increase in acetylcholine (ACh) levels. The present study sought to characterize the cognitive-enhancing effects of the 5-HT(6) antagonist Ro4368554 (3-benzenesulfonyl-7-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)1H-indole) in a rat object recognition task employing a cholinergic (scopolamine pretreatment) and a serotonergic- (tryptophan (TRP) depletion) deficient model, and compared its pattern of action with that of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor metrifonate. Initial testing in a time-dependent forgetting task employing a 24-h delay between training and testing showed that metrifonate improved object recognition (at 10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o.), whereas Ro4368554 was inactive. Both, Ro4368554 (3 and 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and metrifonate (10 mg/kg, p.o., respectively) reversed memory deficits induced by scopolamine and TRP depletion (10 mg/kg, i.p., and 3 mg/kg, p.o., respectively). In conclusion, although Ro4368554 did not improve a time-related retention deficit, it reversed a cholinergic and a serotonergic memory deficit, suggesting that both mechanisms may be involved in the facilitation of object memory by Ro4368554 and, possibly, other 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists.
Anterior segment developmental disorders, including Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly (ARA), variably associate with harmfully elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which causes glaucoma. Clinically observed dysgenesis does not correlate with IOP, however, and the etiology of glaucoma development is not understood. The forkhead transcription factor genes Foxc1 (formerly Mf1) and Foxc2 (formerly Mfh1) are expressed in the mesenchyme from which the ocular drainage structures derive. Mutations in the human homolog of Foxc1, FKHL7, cause dominant anterior segment defects and glaucoma in various families. We show that Foxc1 (+/-) mice have anterior segment abnormalities similar to those reported in human patients. These abnormalities include small or absent Schlemms canal, aberrantly developed trabecular meshwork, iris hypoplasia, severely eccentric pupils and displaced Schwalbes line. The penetrance of clinically obvious abnormalities varies with genetic background. In some affected eyes, collagen bundles were half normal diameter, or collagen and elastic tissue were very sparse. Thus, abnormalities in extracellular matrix synthesis or organization may contribute to development of the ocular phenotypes. Despite the abnormalities in ocular drainage structures in Foxc1 (+/-) mice, IOP was normal in almost all mice analyzed, on all genetic backgrounds and at all ages. Similar abnormalities were found in Foxc2 (+/-) mice, but no disease-associated mutations were identified in the human homolog FKHL14 in 32 ARA patients. Foxc1 (+/-) and Foxc2 (+/-) mice are useful models for studying anterior segment development and its anomalies, and may allow identification of genes that interact with Foxc1 and Foxc2 (or FKHL7 and FKHL14) to produce a phenotype with elevated IOP and glaucoma..
Anthracyclines are effective antineoplastic drugs, but they frequently cause dose-related cardiotoxicity. The cardiotoxicity of conventional anthracycline therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting cardiac dysfunction. We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute leukemia treated with a daunorubicin (DNR)-containing regimen. Thirteen patients with acute leukemia were treated with a DNR-containing regimen. Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies. The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and BNP were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography. Three patients developed congestive heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. Five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. The plasma levels of BNP in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure increased above the normal limit (40 pg/ml) before the detection of clinical or subclinical heart failure by radionuclide angiography. On the other hand, BNP did not increase in the patients without heart failure given DNR, even at more than 700 mg/m(2). The plasma level of ANP did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure. These preliminary results suggest that BNP may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.

Anti-thyroid drugs, like carbimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are commonly prescribed for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. One should be aware of the side effects of antithyroid medications. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)--associated vasculitis is a potentially life-threatening adverse effect of antithyroidmedications. We report a patient with Graves' disease who developed ANCA positive carbimazole induced vasculitis. The episode was characterized by a vasculitic skin rash associated with large joint arthritis, pyrexia and parotiditis but no renal or pulmonary involvement. He was referred to us for neurological evaluation because he had difficulty in getting up from squatting position and was suspected to have myositis. Carbimazole and methimazole have a lower incidence of reported ANCA positive side effects than PUT. To the best of our knowledge this is the first ANCA positive carbimazole induced vasculitis case reported from India.
Antiandrogenic therapy can cause coronary arterial disease.
Antiarrhythmic effects of (+)-cibenzoline and (-)-cibenzoline were examined using two canine ventricular arrhythmia models. Digitalis arrhythmia, which is suppressed by Na channel blockers, was induced by intermittent intravenous (i.v.) injection of ouabain in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Adrenaline arrhythmia, which is suppressed by Ca channel blockers, was induced by adrenaline infusion in halothane-anesthetized dogs. Ten and 5 mg/kg i.v. (+)-cibenzoline suppressed digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias, respectively. The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (+)-cibenzoline for digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias were 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6). A lower dose of 1 mg/kg i.v. of (-)-cibenzoline suppressed the digitalis-induced arrhythmia, whereas 5 mg/kg i.v. was needed to suppress adrenaline-induced arrhythmias. The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (-)-cibenzoline for digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmia were 0.06 +/- 0.04 and 0.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6). The stronger antiarrhythmic effect of (-)-cibenzoline indicates that (-)-isomer may have an effect nearly 5-20 times stronger in suppressing Na channels, but effects of both drugs on Ca channels may be almost equipotent.

Antibodies in the serum of patients with autoimmune diseases have been used to identify human autoantigens. Because autoantibodies often recognize active sites within corresponding protein antigens, autoantibodies have facilitated the functional characterization of these polypeptides. In the present study, serum from a patient with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome was used to identify a novel autoantigen which was designated Ge-1. Using the patient's serum, a 4.8-kb cDNA encoding Ge-1 was identified. Fragments of the cDNA were ligated into prokaryotic expression vectors, expressed in Escherichia coli, and used to produce recombinant Ge-1 fusion proteins. Fusion proteins containing different portions of Ge-1 were used to identify a 58 amino acid immunoreactive region within the protein. This immunoreactive region contained the protein's putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS). To demonstrate that the immunoreactive region was capable of functioning as a NLS, a eukaryotic expression plasmid was constructed to encode the immunoreactive region fused to the cytoplasmic protein, chicken muscle pyruvate kinase. After transfection of this plasmid into COS-1 cells, the fusion protein was detected in the nucleus. The presence of the NLS motif within the immunoreactive region of Ge-1 and other nuclear autoantigens suggests that the NLS may be a target of human autoantibodies.
Anticholinesterases were administered in an attempt to antagonize prolonged neuromuscular blockade following the administration of succinylcholine in a patient later found to be homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase. Edrophonium 10 mg, given 74 min after succinylcholine, when train-of-four stimulation was characteristic of phase II block, produced partial antagonism which was not sustained. Repeated doses of edrophonium to 70 mg and neostigmine to 2.5 mg did not antagonize or augment the block. Spontaneous respiration recommenced 200 min after succinylcholine administration. It is concluded that anticholinesterases are only partially effective in restoring neuromuscular function in succinylcholine apnoea despite muscle twitch activity typical of phase II block.

Antidepressant-induced mania in bipolar patients: identification of risk factors.
Antidepressants have previously been associated with paranoid reactions in psychiatric patients. Five cases of paranoid exacerbation with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and amitriptyline are reported here. Elements common to these cases included a history of paranoid symptomatology and the concomitant occurrence of depressive and psychotic symptoms. Complicated depressive disorders (including atypicality of course and symptomatology, chronicity, psychosis, bipolarity, and secondary onset in the course of a primary psychosis) may present particular vulnerability to paranoid exacerbations associated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Although the pharmacology and neurobiology of paranoia remain cryptic, several mechanisms, including 5HT3 receptor-mediated dopamine release, beta-noradrenergic receptor downregulation, or GABAB receptor upregulation acting in the vicinity of the ventral basal ganglia (possibly in lateral orbitofrontal or anterior cingulate circuits), might apply to this phenomenon. These cases call attention to possible paranoid exacerbations with serotonin reuptake blockers in select patients and raise neurobiological considerations regarding paranoia.

Antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel is the current standard of care for coronary artery disease patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention. However, approximately 25% of patients experience a subtherapeutic antiplatelet response. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that undergoes hepatic biotransformation by CYP2C19 into its active metabolite. Several studies have reported that, compared with wild-type individuals, CYP2C19 variant allele carriers exhibit a significantly lower capacity to metabolize clopidogrel into its active metabolite and inhibit platelet activation, and are therefore at significantly higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Consequently, the US FDA has recently changed clopidogrel's prescribing information to highlight the impact of CYP2C19 genotype on clopidogrel pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical response. Future studies remain necessary to develop effective personalized therapeutic strategies for CYP2C19 variant allele carriers and other individuals at risk for clopidogrel nonresponsiveness.

Antituberculosis therapy (ATT)-associated acute liver failure (ATT-ALF) is the commonest drug-induced ALF in South Asia. Prospective studies on ATT-ALF are lacking. The current study prospectively evaluated the magnitude, clinical course, outcome, and prognostic factors in ATT-ALF. From January 1986 to January 2009, 1223 consecutive ALF patients were evaluated: ATT alone was the cause in 70 (5.7%) patients. Another 15 (1.2%) had ATT and simultaneous hepatitis virus infection. In 44 (62.8%) patients, ATT was prescribed empirically without definitive evidence of tuberculosis. ATT-ALF patients were younger (32.87 [+/-15.8] years), and 49 (70%) of them were women. Most had hyperacute presentation; the median icterus encephalopathy interval was 4.5 (0-30) days. The median duration of ATT before ALF was 30 (7-350) days. At presentation, advanced encephalopathy and cerebral edema were present in 51 (76%) and 29 (41.4%) patients, respectively. Gastrointestinal bleed, seizures, infection, and acute renal failure were documented in seven (10%), five (7.1%), 26 (37.1%), and seven (10%) patients, respectively. Compared with hepatitis E virus (HEV) and non-A non-E-induced ALF, ATT-ALF patients had nearly similar presentations except for older age and less elevation of liver enzymes. The mortality rate among patients with ATT-ALF was high (67.1%, n = 47), and only 23 (32.9%) patients recovered with medical treatment. In multivariate analysis, three factors independently predicted mortality: serum bilirubin (>or=10.8 mg/dL), prothrombin time (PT) prolongation (>or=26 seconds), and grade III/IV encephalopathy at presentation. CONCLUSION: ATT-ALF constituted 5.7% of ALF at our center and had a high mortality rate. Because the mortality rate is so high, determining which factors are predictors is less important. A high proportion of patients had consumed ATT empirically, which could have been prevented.

Antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity induced by doxorubicin were studied in LOU/M/WSL inbred rats each bearing a transplantable solid IgM immunocytoma. Animals with a tumor (diameter, 15.8 +/- 3.3 mm) were treated with iv injections of doxorubicin on 5 consecutive days, followed by 1 weekly injection for 7 weeks (dose range, 0.015-4.0 mg/kg body wt). Tumor regression was observed with 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg. Complete disappearance of the tumor was induced with 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Histologic evidence of cardiotoxicity scored as grade III was only observed at a dose of 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Light microscopic evidence of renal damage was seen above a dose of 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg, which resulted in albuminuria and very low serum albumin levels. In the group that received 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg, the serum albumin level decreased from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter. Ascites and hydrothorax were observed simultaneously. The same experiments were performed with non-tumor-bearing rats, in which no major differences were observed. In conclusion, antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were studied simultaneously in the same LOU/M/WSL rat. Albuminuria due to renal damage led to extremely low serum albumin levels, so ascites and hydrothorax were not necessarily a consequence of the observed cardiomyopathy.

Apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease. While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating Parkinson's disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study. A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with levodopa and that apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off-periods even in patients with complex on-off motor swings. Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions can reduce daily off-time by more than 50% in this group of patients, which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add-on therapy with oral dopamine agonists or COMT inhibitors. Extended follow-up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long-term persistence of apomorphine efficacy. In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa-induced dyskinesias. The main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems, whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role. Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating Parkinson's disease, this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use.
Apomorphine: an underutilized therapy for Parkinson's disease.
Apoptosis has recently been recognized as a mode of cell death in Huntington disease (HD). Apopain, a human counterpart of the nematode cysteine protease death-gene product, CED-3, has a key role in proteolytic events leading to apoptosis. Here we show that apoptotic extracts and apopain itself specifically cleave the HD gene product, huntingtin. The rate of cleavage increases with the length of the huntingtin polyglutamine tract, providing an explanation for the gain-of-function associated with CAG expansion. Our results show that huntingtin is cleaved by cysteine proteases and suggest that HD might be a disorder of inappropriate apoptosis..
Apoptosis specific proteins (ASP) are expressed in the cytoplasm of cultured mammalian cells of various lineages following induction of apoptosis. The cDNA encoding ASP has been cloned from a human expression library and has significant homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae APG5 gene which is essential for yeast autophagy. The ASP gene, known as hAPG5, can be transcribed to give mRNAs of 3.3 kbp, 2.5 kbp and 1.8 kbp which are present at comparable levels in viable and apoptotic cells, demonstrating that protein expression must be regulated at the translational level. These data indicate a possible relationship between apoptosis and autophagy and suggest evolutionary conservation in mammalian apoptosis of a degradative process present in yeast.

Appreciable beta hexosaminidase A (hex A) activity has been detected in cultured skin fibroblasts and melanoma tissue from healthy individuals previously reported as having deficiency of hex A activity indistinguishable from that of patients with Tay-Sachs disease (TSD). Identification and quantitation of hex A, amounting to 3. 5% -6. 9% of total beta hexosaminidase activity, has been obtained by cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis, DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography, radial immunodiffusion, and radioimmunoassay. Previous family studies suggested that these individuals may be compound heterozygotes for the common mutant TSD gene and a rare (allelic) mutant gene. Thus, the postulated rate mutant gene appears to code for the expression of low amounts of hex A. Heterozygotes for the rare mutant may be indistinguishable from heterozygotes for the common TSD mutant. However, direct visualization and quantitation of hex A by the methods described may prevent false-positive prenatal diagnosis of TSD in fetuses having the incomplete hex A deficiency of the type described in the four healthy individuals
Approximately 0. 5% -1% of the general population has been estimated to be heterozygous for a germline mutation in the ATM gene. Mutations in the ATM gene are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) (MIM 208900). The finding that ATM-heterozygotes have an increased relative risk for breast cancer was supported by some studies but not confirmed by others. In view of this discrepancy, we examined the frequency of ATM germline mutations in a selected group of Dutch patients with breast cancer. We have analyzed ATM germline mutations in normal blood lymphocytes, using the protein-truncation test followed by genomic-sequence analysis. A high percentage of ATM germline mutations was demonstrated among patients with sporadic breast cancer. The 82 patients included in this study had developed breast cancer at age < 45 and had survived >/= 5 years (mean 15 years), and in 33 (40%) of the patients a contralateral breast tumor had been diagnosed. Among these patients we identified seven (8. 5%) ATM germline mutations, of which five are distinct. One splice-site mutation (IVS10-6T-- > G) was detected three times in our series. Four heterozygous carriers were patients with bilateral breast cancer. Our results indicate that the mutations identified in this study are " A-T disease-causing " mutations that might be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in heterozygotes. We conclude that ATM heterozygotes have an approximately ninefold-increased risk of developing a type of breast cancer characterized by frequent bilateral occurrence, early age at onset, and long-term survival. The specific characteristics of our population of patients may explain why such a high frequency was not found in other series.
Approximately 50% of childhood deafness is caused by mutations in specific genes. Autosomal recessive loci account for approximately 80% of nonsyndromic genetic deafness. Here we report the identification of a new transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS3; also known as ECHOS1) expressed in many tissues, including fetal cochlea, which is mutated in the families used to describe both the DFNB10 and DFNB8 loci. An 8-bp deletion and insertion of 18 monomeric (approximately 68-bp) beta-satellite repeat units, normally present in tandem arrays of up to several hundred kilobases on the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes, causes congenital deafness (DFNB10). A mutation in a splice-acceptor site, resulting in a 4-bp insertion in the mRNA and a frameshift, was detected in childhood onset deafness (DFNB8). This is the first description of beta-satellite insertion into an active gene resulting in a pathogenic state, and the first description of a protease involved in hearing loss.

Argatroban is a hepatically metabolized, direct thrombin inhibitor used for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and for patients with or at risk of HIT undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The objective of this review is to summarize practical considerations of argatroban therapy in HIT. The US FDA-recommended argatroban dose in HIT is 2 microg/kg/min (reduced in patients with hepatic impairment and in paediatric patients), adjusted to achieve activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) 1.5-3 times baseline (not >100 seconds). Contemporary experiences indicate that reduced doses are also needed in patients with conditions associated with hepatic hypoperfusion, e.g. heart failure, yet are unnecessary for renal dysfunction, adult age, sex, race/ethnicity or obesity. Argatroban 0.5-1.2 microg/kg/min typically supports therapeutic aPTTs. The FDA-recommended dose during PCI is 25 microg/kg/min (350 microg/kg initial bolus), adjusted to achieve activated clotting times (ACTs) of 300-450 sec. For PCI, argatroban has not been investigated in hepatically impaired patients; dose adjustment is unnecessary for adult age, sex, race/ethnicity or obesity, and lesser doses may be adequate with concurrent glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition. Argatroban prolongs the International Normalized Ratio, and published approaches for monitoring the argatroban-to-warfarin transition should be followed. Major bleeding with argatroban is 0-10% in the non-interventional setting and 0-5.8% periprocedurally. Argatroban has no specific antidote, and if excessive anticoagulation occurs, argatroban infusion should be stopped or reduced. Improved familiarity of healthcare professionals with argatroban therapy in HIT, including in special populations and during PCI, may facilitate reduction of harm associated with HIT (e.g. fewer thromboses) or its treatment (e.g. fewer argatroban medication errors).
Argininemia is a rare autossomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency in the cytosolic liver-type arginase enzyme (L-arginine urea-hydrolase; E. C. 3. 5. 3. 1). In order to investigate the molecular basis for argininemia in four unrelated Portuguese patients (two from northern Portugal and two from Madeira Island) we performed a DNA sequence analysis of all the exons and exon/intron boundaries of the liver-type arginase gene (ARG1). All patients were found to be homozygous for a newly identified C - > T transition in codon 21 (exon 2) substituting arginine for a premature stop codon (R21X CGA to TGA) and generating a NlaIII restriction site. Restriction digestion following PCR amplification of ARG1 exon 2 confirmed the presence of the mutation.

Arterial hypertension as a complication of prolonged ketoconazole treatment.
Arterial thromboembolism in patients receiving systemic heparin therapy: a complication associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Arterial thromboembolism is a recognized complication of systemic heparin therapy. Characteristic of the entity is arterial occlusion by platelet-fibrin thrombi with distal ischemia occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of heparin therapy, preceded by profound thrombocytopenia with platelet counts in the range of 30,000 to 40,000 per cubic millimeter. The clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms that appear to be ischemic in origin, and might serve to warn the clinician of these complications. Previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of heparin are reviewed. The common factor relating thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia is heparin-induced platelet aggregation. Appropriate treatment consists of discontinuation of heparin, and anticoagulation with sodium warfarin if necessary. Vascular procedures are performed as indicated.
Arteritis induced in rats by vasodilators, fenoldopam and theophylline, was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and tumor growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Rats were administered fenoldopam for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of theophylline. Irrespective of theophylline administration, iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on day 5 and 8 post-fenoldopam-infusion (DPI); bFGF antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on 1 and 3 DPI; TGF-beta1 antigens were observed in ED-1-positive cells on and after 5 DPI. These results suggest that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was followed by that of bFGF antigen, and bFGF may have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these rat arteritis models. On the other hand, TGF-beta1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models.
Arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs) catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to arylhydrazines and to arylamine drugs and carcinogens or to their N-hydroxylated metabolites. NAT plays an important role in detoxification and metabolic activation of xenobiotics and was first identified as the enzyme responsible for inactivation of the antitubercular drug isoniazid, an arylhydrazine. The rate of inactivation was polymorphically distributed in the population: the first example of interindividual pharmacogenetic variation. Polymorphism in NAT activity is primarily due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of NAT genes. NAT enzymes are widely distributed in eukaryotes and genome sequences have revealed many homologous members of this enzyme family in prokaryotes. The structures of S almonella typhimurium and Mycobacterium smegmatis NATs have been determined, revealing a unique fold in which a catalytic triad (Cys-His-Asp) forms the active site. Determination of prokaryotic and eukaryotic NAT structures could lead to a better understanding of their role in xenobiotics and endogenous metabolism.

Asenapine is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration in adults for acute treatment of schizophrenia or of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder with or without psychotic features. In a double-blind 6-week trial, 458 patients with acute schizophrenia were randomly assigned to fixed-dose treatment with asenapine at 5 mg twice daily (BID), asenapine at 10 mg BID, placebo, or haloperidol at 4 mg BID (to verify assay sensitivity). With last observations carried forward (LOCF), mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score reductions from baseline to endpoint were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 mg BID (-16.2) and haloperidol (-15.4) than placebo (-10.7; both P < 0.05); using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), changes at day 42 were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID (-21.3 and -19.4, respectively) and haloperidol (-20.0) than placebo (-14.6; all P < 0.05). On the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive subscale, all treatments were superior to placebo with LOCF and MMRM; asenapine at 5 mg BID was superior to placebo on the negative subscale with MMRM and on the general psychopathology subscale with LOCF and MMRM. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 44% and 52%, 57%, and 41% of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively. Extrapyramidal symptoms reported as AEs occurred in 15% and 18%, 34%, and 10% of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively. Across all groups, no more than 5% of patients had clinically significant weight change. Post hoc analyses indicated that efficacy was similar with asenapine and haloperidol; greater contrasts were seen in AEs, especially extrapyramidal symptoms.

Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA). The main symptom is progressive mental retardation. A spectrum of different mutations has been reported in this disease, one missense mutation (Cys163Ser) being responsible for the majority of Finnish cases. We were able to examine 66 Finnish AGU patients for changes in the oral mucosa and 44 of these for changes in facial skin. Biopsy specimens of 16 oral lesions, 12 of them associated with the teeth, plus two facial lesions were studied histologically. Immunohistochemical staining for AGA was performed on 15 oral specimens. Skin was seborrhoeic in adolescent and adult patients, with erythema of the facial skin already common in childhood. Of 44 patients, nine (20%) had facial angiofibromas, tumours primarily occurring in association with tuberous sclerosis. Oedemic buccal mucosa (leucoedema) and gingival overgrowths were more frequent in AGU patients than in controls (p < 0. 001). Of 16 oral mucosal lesions studied histologically, 15 represented fibroepithelial or epithelial hyperplasias and were reactive in nature. Cytoplasmic vacuolisation was evident in four. Immunohistochemically, expression of AGA in AGU patients mucosal lesions did not differ from that seen in corresponding lesions of normal subjects. Thus, the high frequency of mucosal overgrowth in AGU patients does not appear to be directly associated with lysosomal storage or with alterations in the level of AGA expression.
Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is a rare disorder of glycoprotein metabolism caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA). AGU is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and occurs with a high frequency in Finland because of a founder effect. While very few patients with AGU have been reported from non-Finnish origin, we diagnosed the disorder in 8 patients originating from 3 unrelated families, all Palestinian Arabs from the region of Jerusalem. The clinical diagnosis of AGU is often difficult, in particular early in the course of the disease, and most of the patients are diagnosed after the age of 5 years. However, since these patients excrete early large amounts of aspartylglucosamine in urine, biochemical screening is easy by urine chromatography..
Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is a recessive autosomally inherited lysosomal storage disorder due to deficiency of the enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA). The structural gene for this human enzyme (AGA) has been assigned to the region 4q21----qter. We determined the AGA activity in cultured fibroblasts of a girl with a 46, XX, del (4) (q33) karyotype. The results indicate that the girl is a hemizygote for AGA, permitting the assignment of human AGA to the region 4q33----qter..
Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is caused by deficient activity of the enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA). The structural gene for AGA has been assigned to the region 4q21-qter of chromosome 4. We have studied the map position of the AGU locus in relation to other marker loci on the long arm of chromosome 4 using linkage analyses. Restriction fragment length polymorphism alleles for the ADH2, ADH3, EGF, FG alpha and FG beta loci and blood group antigens for the MNS locus were determined in a panel of 12 Finnish AGU families. The heterozygous family members were identified by reduced activity of AGA in lymphocytes. Linkage studies were performed using both pairwise and multipoint analyses. Loose linkage of the AGU locus to the FG and MNS loci was observed (z = 1. 16, z = 1. 39, respectively). Multipoint analysis to the fixed map [ADH- (0. 03) -EGF- (0. 35) -FG- (0. 11) -MNS] suggests that the location of the AGU locus is 0. 05-0. 30 recombination units distal to MNS (z = 3. 03). The order cen-ADH-EGF-FG-MNS-AGU is 35 times more likely than the next best order cen-ADH-EGF-AGU-FG-MNS.

At least 110 genes are now known to be located in the 4000 kb of DNA encompassing the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the chromosome band 6p21.3. Recent genomic sequence analysis of a 90 kb segment of DNA containing the tumour necrosis factor genes in the class III region of the MHC has predicted the presence of three potential exons mapping between the BAT1 and TNFB genes (12). A near full-length cDNA clone corresponding to a novel gene located between BAT1 and TNFB that contains sequence corresponding to one of these putative exons, has been isolated from a premonocytic leukaemic cell line cDNA library. Characterization of this gene reveals that it spans 13.5 kb of DNA, with the 3' end of the gene lying approximately 12 kb from the 5' end of the TNFB gene. The cDNA hybridizes to a approximately 1.6 kb mRNA in a number of different cell types, including monocytes, T cells, B cells and hepatocytes. The putative polypeptide encoded by this cDNA is 381 amino acids in length, with a non-glycosylated M(r) of 43214. It contains one partial and two full ANK repeats, which bear a marked similarity to those in the I kappa B family of proteins, suggesting that the protein encoded by the novel gene could represent a divergent member of this family.
At most synapses, chemical signalling is terminated by a rapid reaccumulation of neurotransmitter into presynaptic terminals. Uptake systems for the biogenic amines are the initial site of action for therapeutic antidepressants and drugs such as cocaine and the amphetamines. We have isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a human noradrenaline transporter. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein of 617 amino acids, with 12-13 highly hydrophobic regions compatible with membrane-spanning domains. Expression of the cDNA clone in transfected HeLa cells indicates that noradrenaline transport activity is sodium-dependent and sensitive to selective noradrenaline transport inhibitors. Transporter RNA is localized to the brainstem and the adrenal gland. The predicted protein sequence demonstrates significant amino-acid identity with the Na+/gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter, thus identifying a new gene family for neurotransmitter transporter proteins. Analysis of its structure and function may lead to structure-based drug design for the treatment of human depression and could help determine whether transporter abnormalities underlie affective disorders.
Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) are recessive genetic disorders with susceptibility to cancer and similar cellular phenotypes. The protein product of the gene responsible for A-T, designated ATM, is a member of a family of kinases characterized by a carboxy-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like domain. The NBS1 protein is specifically mutated in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome and forms a complex with the DNA repair proteins Rad50 and Mrel1. Here we show that phosphorylation of NBS1, induced by ionizing radiation, requires catalytically active ATM. Complexes containing ATM and NBS1 exist in vivo in both untreated cells and cells treated with ionizing radiation. We have identified two residues of NBS1, Ser 278 and Ser 343 that are phosphorylated in vitro by ATM and whose modification in vivo is essential for the cellular response to DNA damage. This response includes S-phase checkpoint activation, formation of the NBS1/Mrel1/Rad50 nuclear foci and rescue of hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Together, these results demonstrate a biochemical link between cell-cycle checkpoints activated by DNA damage and DNA repair in two genetic diseases with overlapping phenotypes..
Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a recessive multi-system disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene at 11q22-q23 (ref. 3). The risk of cancer, especially lymphoid neoplasias, is substantially elevated in A-T patients and has long been associated with chromosomal instability. By analysing tumour DNA from patients with sporadic T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), a rare clonal malignancy with similarities to a mature T-cell leukaemia seen in A-T, we demonstrate a high frequency of ATM mutations in T-PLL. In marked contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in A-T, the most frequent nucleotide changes in this leukaemia were missense mutations. These clustered in the region corresponding to the kinase domain, which is highly conserved in ATM-related proteins in mouse, yeast and Drosophila. The resulting amino-acid substitutions are predicted to interfere with ATP binding or substrate recognition. Two of seventeen mutated T-PLL samples had a previously reported A-T allele. In contrast, no mutations were detected in the p53 gene, suggesting that this tumour suppressor is not frequently altered in this leukaemia. Occasional missense mutations in ATM were also found in tumour DNA from patients with B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas (B-NHL) and a B-NHL cell line. The evidence of a significant proportion of loss-of-function mutations and a complete absence of the normal copy of ATM in the majority of mutated tumours establishes somatic inactivation of this gene in the pathogenesis of sporadic T-PLL and suggests that ATM acts as a tumour suppressor. As constitutional DNA was not available, a putative hereditary predisposition to T-PLL will require further investigation..
Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive syndrome associated with a greatly increased incidence of malignant neoplasms in homozygous affected individuals. Heterozygotes for the gene for A-T are thought to comprise about 1% of the general population and, therefore, it is important to know whether this gene also predisposes the heterozygous carrier to cancers. Heterozygous carriers of this gene are common among the close relatives of patients with A-T, although individual carriers cannot be identified by any clinical criterion or laboratory test. For this reason, we compared the incidence of death from malignant neoplasms in 2 families of patients with A-T to that expected in a random sample of the general population. There were 59 deaths from malignant neoplasms in relatives dying before age 75, compared to 42. 6 expected (p less than 0. 02). For A-T heterozygotes younger than age 45, the risk of dying from a malignant neoplasm was estimated to be greater than 5 times the risk for the general population. A-T heterozygotes may comprise more than 5% of all persons dying from a cancer before age 45. The incidence of ovarian, gastric, and biliary system carcinomas and of leukemia and lymphoma was increased in these A-T families. Other neoplasms that may be associated with this gene in heterozygotes include pancreatic, basal cell, colonic, breast, and cervical carcinomas.
Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by a markedly increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, increased incidence of cancer, and neurodegeneration, especially of the cerebellar Purkinje cells. Ionizing radiation oxidizes macromolecules and causes tissue damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We therefore hypothesized that A-T is due to oxidative damage resulting from loss of function of the A-T gene product. To assess this hypothesis, we employed an animal model of A-T, the mouse with a disrupted Atm gene. We show that organs which develop pathologic changes in the Atm-deficient mice are targets of oxidative damage, and that cerebellar Purkinje cells are particularly affected. These observations provide a mechanistic basis for the A-T phenotype and lay a rational foundation for therapeutic intervention..
Ataxia-telangiectasia is a hereditary multisystemic disease resulting from mutations of ataxia telangiectasia, mutated (ATM) and is characterized by neurodegeneration, cancer, immune defects, and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. The molecular details of ATM function in the nervous system are unclear, although the neurological lesion in ataxia-telangiectasia becomes apparent early in life, suggesting a developmental origin. The central nervous system (CNS) of Atm-null mice shows a pronounced defect in apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress, suggesting ATM functions to eliminate neurons with excessive genomic damage. Here, we report that the death effector Bax is required for a large proportion of Atm-dependent apoptosis in the developing CNS after ionizing radiation (IR). Although many of the same regions of the CNS in both Bax-/- and Atm-/- mice were radioresistant, mice nullizygous for both Bax and Atm showed additional reduction in IR-induced apoptosis in the CNS. Therefore, although the major IR-induced apoptotic pathway in the CNS requires Atm and Bax, a p53-dependent collateral pathway exists that has both Atm- and Bax-independent branches. Further, Atm- and Bax-dependent apoptosis in the CNS also required caspase-3 activation. These data implicate Bax and caspase-3 as death effectors in neurodegenerative pathways..
Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare genetic disorder associated with immune deficiency, chromosome instability, and a predisposition to lymphoid malignancy. We have detected chromosomally anomalous clones of lymphocytes in eight patients with this disorder. Chromosome banding disclosed that the clones are consistently marked by structural rearrangement of the long arm (q) of chromosome 14. A translocation involving 14q was found in clones obtained from seven of the eight patients whereas a ring 14 chromosome was found in a clone obtained from the other. These findings as well as data obtained by others for patients with ataxia-telangiectasia suggest that structural rearrangement of 14q is the initial chromosomal change in lymphocyte clones of patients with this disorder. Chromosomes of lymphocytes from one of the patients were studied before and after the onset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Before leukemia was diagnosed, the patient had a lymphocyte clone with a 14q translocation. This clone appears to have given rise to the leukemic cells. We hypothesize that structural rearrangement of 14q is directly related to abnormal growth of lymphocytes and that it may be a step toward the development of lymphoid malignancies. Increasing evidence, provided by others, for the nonrandom involvement of 14q in African-type Burkitts lymphoma and other lymphoid neoplasms further strengthens this hypothesis..

Atelosteogenesis type II (AO II) is a neonatally lethal chondrodysplasia whose clinical and histological characteristics resemble those of another chondrodysplasia, the much less severe diastrophic dysplasia (DTD). The similarity suggests a shared pathogenesis involving lesions in the same biochemical pathway and perhaps the same gene. DTD is caused by mutations in the recently identified diastrophic dysplasia sulfate-transporter gene (DTDST). Here, we report that AOII patients also have DTDST mutations, which lead to defective uptake of inorganic sulfate and insufficient sulfation of macromolecules by patient mesenchymal cells in vitro. Together with our recent observation that a third even more severe chondrodysplasia, achondrogenesis type IB, is also caused by mutations in DTDST, these results demonstrate a phenotypic series of three chondrodysplasias of increasing severity caused by lesions in a single sulfate-transporter gene. The severity of the phenotype appears to be correlated with the predicted effect of the mutations on the residual activity of the DTDST protein..

Atm and Bax cooperate in ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis in the central nervous system.
Atm, the mouse homolog of the human ATM gene defective in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), has been identified. The entire coding sequence of the Atm transcript was cloned and found to contain an open reading frame encoding a protein of 3066 amino acids with 84% overall identity and 91% similarity to the human ATM protein. Variable levels of expression of Atm were observed in different tissues. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and linkage analysis located the Atm gene on mouse chromosome 9, band 9C, in a region homologous to the ATM region on human chromosome 11q22-q23..

Atrial fibrillation following chemotherapy for stage IIIE diffuse large B-cell gastric lymphoma in a patient with myotonic dystrophy (Steinert's disease).
Atrial fibrillation in young patients without structural heart disease is rare. Therefore, when the arrhythmia is present in this population, reversible causes must be identified and resolved. Thyroid disorders, illicit drug or stimulant use, and acute alcohol intoxication are among these causes. We report the case of a 30-year-old Caucasian man who came to the emergency department in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. His medical history was unremarkable, except for minor fractures of the fingers and foot. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, magnesium, and potassium levels were within normal limits, urine drug screen was negative, and alcohol use was denied. However, when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements, the use of creatine monohydrate was revealed. The patient was admitted to the hospital, anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin, and given intravenous diltiazem for rate control and intravenous amiodarone for rate and rhythm control. When discharged less than 24 hours later, he was receiving metoprolol and aspirin, with follow-up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion. Exogenous creatine is used by athletes to theoretically improve exercise performance. Vegetarians may also take creatine to replace what they are not consuming from meat, fish, and other animal products. Previous anecdotal reports have linked creatine to the development of arrhythmia. Clinicians must be diligent when interviewing patients about their drug therapy histories and include questions about their use of herbal products and dietary supplements. In addition, it is important to report adverse effects associated with frequently consumed supplements and herbal products to the Food and Drug Administration and in the literature.
Atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62%, and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22%. Overall, in high-risk patients, warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes, with a relative risk reduction of 36%. Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was found to be as efficient as vitamin K antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events, but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function tests. The ACTIVE-W (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) in the prevention af embolic events. Idraparinux, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor-blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling. Preliminary studies suggest that statins could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion. Finally, percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high-risk patients.

Atrophin-1 contains a polyglutamine repeat, expansion of which is responsible for dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The normal function of atrophin-1 is unknown. We have identified five atrophin-1 interacting proteins (AIPs) which bind to atrophin-1 in the vicinity of the polyglutamine tract using the yeast two-hybrid system. Four of the interactions were confirmed using in vitro binding assays. All five interactors contained multiple WW domains. Two are novel. The AIPs can be divided into two distinct classes. AIP1 and AIP3/WWP3 are MAGUK-like multidomain proteins containing a number of protein-protein interaction modules, namely a guanylate kinase-like region, two WW domains, and multiple PDZ domains. AIP2/WWP2, AIP4, and AIP5/WWP1 are highly homologous, each having four WW domains and a HECT domain characteristic of ubiquitin ligases. These interactors are similar to recently isolated huntingtin-interacting proteins, suggesting possible commonality of function between two proteins responsible for very similar diseases.

Atypical or variant forms of well-known chondrodysplasias may pose diagnostic problems. We report on a girl with clinical features suggesting diastrophic dysplasia but with unusual radiographic features including severe platyspondyly, wide metaphyses, and fibular overgrowth, which are partially reminiscent of metatropic dysplasia. The diagnosis was clarified by molecular analysis of the DTDST gene, which revealed homozygosity for a previously undescribed mutation leading to a Q454P substitution in the 10th transmembrane domain of the DTDST sulfate transporter. Molecular analysis may be of particular value in such atypical cases..

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting before 3 years of age with deficits in communication and social skills and repetitive behaviors. In addition to genetic influences, recent studies suggest that prenatal drug or chemical exposures are risk factors for autism. Terbutaline, a beta2-adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest preterm labor, has been associated with increased concordance for autism in dizygotic twins. We studied the effects of terbutaline on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rats. Newborn rats were given terbutaline (10 mg/kg) daily on postnatal days (PN) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at PN 30. Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex, as well as in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter. None of these effects occurred in animals given terbutaline on PN 11 to 14. In behavioral tests, animals treated with terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 showed consistent patterns of hyper-reactivity to novelty and aversive stimuli when assessed in a novel open field, as well as in the acoustic startle response test. Our findings indicate that beta2-adrenoceptor overstimulation during an early critical period results in microglial activation associated with innate neuroinflammatory pathways and behavioral abnormalities, similar to those described in autism. This study provides a useful animal model for understanding the neuropathological processes underlying autism spectrum disorders.
Autoantibodies to a novel nuclear Ag, Sp100, have recently been described that recognize a nuclear protein with an apparent molecular mass of 95 to 100 kDa and a dot-like distribution within cell nuclei. By immunoscreening of a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library derived from HeLa cells with an anti-Sp100 autoimmune serum a 0.7-kb cDNA (Sp26) coding for a fragment of Sp100 was isolated. Expression of this cDNA and use of the recombinant protein in ELISA revealed that the fragment carries major Sp100 autoepitopes and that anti-Sp100 autoantibodies predominantly occur in patients suffering from primary biliary cirrhosis (50/184). The Sp26 cDNA was used as hybridization probe for isolation of longer cDNA from human liver- and placenta-derived lambda gt10 cDNA libraries. Overlapping fragments were assembled to generate a full length cDNA coding for a protein with a molecular mass of 53 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.7. The Sp100 autoantigen expressed in vitro from this cDNA and authenticated by a capture immunoblot assay, comigrated in SDS-PAGE with the authentic HeLa autoantigen of 95 to 100 kDa and thus showed an aberrant electrophoretic mobility. Computer based protein sequence analysis of the Sp100 autoantigen revealed regions of striking sequence similarities to the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of various human and non-human MHC class I Ag and to several transacting transcriptional regulatory proteins.
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome with defective Fas: genotype influences penetrance.
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) in a child from consanguineous parents: a dominant or recessive disease?
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a disorder of lymphocyte homeostasis and immunological tolerance. Most patients have a heterozygous mutation in the APT1 gene, which encodes Fas (CD95, APO-1), mediator of an apoptotic pathway crucial to lymphocyte homeostasis. Of 17 unique APT1 mutations in unrelated ALPS probands, 12 (71%) occurred in exons 7-9, which encode the intracellular portion of Fas. In vitro, activated lymphocytes from all 17 patients showed apoptotic defects when exposed to an anti-Fas agonist monoclonal antibody. Similar defects were found in a Fas-negative cell line transfected with cDNAs bearing each of the mutations. In cotransfection experiments, Fas constructs with either intra- or extracellular mutations caused dominant inhibition of apoptosis mediated by wild-type Fas. Two missense Fas variants, not restricted to patients with ALPS, were identified. Variant A (-1) T at the Fas signal-sequence cleavage site, which mediates apoptosis less well than wild-type Fas and is partially inhibitory, was present in 13% of African American alleles. Among the ALPS-associated Fas mutants, dominant inhibition of apoptosis was much more pronounced in mutants affecting the intracellular, versus extracellular, portion of the Fas receptor. Mutations causing disruption of the intracellular Fas death domain also showed a higher penetrance of ALPS phenotype features in mutation-bearing relatives. Significant ALPS-related morbidity occurred in 44% of relatives with intracellular mutations, versus 0% of relatives with extracellular mutations. Thus, the location of mutations within APT1 strongly influences the development and the severity of ALPS.
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is characterized by autoimmune features and lymphoproliferations and is generally caused by defective Fas-mediated apoptosis. This report describes a child with clinical features of ALPS without detectable Fas expression on freshly isolated blood leukocytes. Detection of FAS transcripts via real-time quantitative PCR made a severe transcriptional defect unlikely. Sequencing of the FAS gene revealed a 20-nucleotide duplication in the last exon affecting the cytoplasmic signaling domain. The patient was homozygous for this mutation, whereas the consanguineous parents and the siblings were heterozygous. The patient reported here is a human homologue of the Fas-null mouse, inasmuch as she carries an autosomal homozygous mutation in the FAS gene and she shows the severe and accelerated ALPS phenotype. The heterozygous family members did not have the ALPS phenotype, indicating that the disease-causing FAS mutation in this family is autosomal recessive..

Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe autoimmune diseases. Worldwide, over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase I and II clinical trials. The results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase III trials. However, as predicted, significant transplant-related morbidity and mortality have been observed. This is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to infections. The number of deaths related to cardiac toxicity is low. However, caution is required when cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone are used in patients with a possible underlying heart damage, for example, systemic sclerosis patients. In November 2002, a meeting was held in Florence, bringing together a number of experts in various fields, including rheumatology, cardiology, neurology, pharmacology and transplantation medicine. The object of the meeting was to analyse existing data, both published or available, in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation autoimmune disease database, and to propose a safe approach to such patients. A full cardiological assessment before and during the transplant emerged as the major recommendation.

Autosomal dominant myotonia congenita is an inherited disorder of skeletal muscle caused by mutations in a voltage-gated Cl- channel gene (CLCN1, 7q35). Here, we report that a mutation predicting the substitution of Gly 230 by glutamic acid (G230E) between segments D3 and D4 dramatically alters the pore properties of a recombinant human muscle Cl- channel (hCIC-1) expressed in a mammalian cell line (tsA201). The G230E mutation causes substantial changes in anion and cation selectivity as well as a fundamental change in rectification of the current-voltage relationship. Whereas wild-type channels are characterized by pronounced inward rectification and a Cl > thiocyanate > Br > NO (3) > I > CH (3) SO (3) selectivity, G230E exhibits outward rectification at positive potentials and a thiocyanate > NO (3) > I > Br > Cl > CH (3) SO (3) selectivity. Furthermore, the cation-to-anion permeability ratio of the mutant is much greater than that of the wild-type channel. Voltage-dependent blocks by intracellular and extracellular iodide help to distinguish two distinct ion binding sites within the hClC-1 conduction pathway. Both binding sites are preserved in the mutant but have decreased affinities for iodide. These findings suggest that Gly 230 is critical for normal ion conductance in hClC-1 and that this residue resides within the channel pore..
Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (ADNDI) is an inherited disease caused by progressive degeneration of the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus leading to decreased ability to produce the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). Affected individuals are not symptomatic at birth, but usually develop diabetes insipidus at 1-6 yr of age. The genetic locus of the disease is the AVP-neurophysin II (NPII) gene, and mutations that cause ADNDI have been found in both the signal peptide of the prepro-AVP-NPII precursor and within NPII itself. An affected girl who presented at 9 months of age and her similarly affected younger brother and father were all found to have a novel missense mutation (G1758-- > T) encoding the amino acid substitution Gly23-- > Val within NPII. The mutation was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis. A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the fathers pituitary gland demonstrates an attenuated posterior pituitary bright spot. This mutation may be valuable for developing models of dominantly inherited neurodegeneration, as the early age of onset of symptoms suggests that this mutation may be particularly deleterious to the magnocellular neuron..
Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus associated with a missense mutation encoding Gly23-->Val in neurophysin II.
Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is a familial form of diabetes insipidus. This disorder is associated with variable levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and diabetes insipidus of varying severity, which responds to exogenous AVP. To determine the molecular basis of autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, the AVP genes of members of a large kindred were analyzed. A new method, called dideoxy fingerprinting, was used to detect an AVP mutation that was characterized by DNA sequencing. The novel defect found changes the last codon of the AVP signal peptide from alanine to threonine, which should perturb cleavage of mature AVP from its precursor protein and inhibit its secretion or action..
Autosomal dominant primary hyperparathyroidism and jaw tumor syndrome associated with renal hamartomas and cystic kidney disease: linkage to 1q21-q32 and loss of the wild type allele in renal hamartomas.
Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) is a heterogeneous set of progressive retinopathies caused by several distinct genes. One locus, the RP10 form of adRP, maps to human chromosome 7q31.1 and may account for 5-10% of adRP cases among Americans and Europeans. We identified two American families with the RP10 form of adRP by linkage mapping and used these families to reduce the linkage interval to 3.45 Mb between the flanking markers D7S686 and RP-STR8. Sequence and transcript analysis identified 54 independent genes within this region, at least 10 of which are retinal-expressed and thus candidates for the RP10 gene. A screen of retinal transcripts comparing retinas from normal mice to retinas from crx-/crx- knockout mice (with poorly differentiated photoreceptors) demonstrated a 6-fold reduction in one candidate, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1; EC 1.1.1.205). Since many of the genes known to cause retinitis pigmentosa are under CRX control in photoreceptors, IMPDH1 became a high-priority candidate for mutation screening. DNA sequencing of affected individuals from the two American RP10 families revealed a GAC-->AAC transition in codon 226 substituting an asparagine for an aspartic acid in both families. The identical mutation was also found in a British RP10 family. The Asp226Asn missense mutation is present in all affected individuals tested and absent from unaffected controls. The aspartic acid at codon 226 is conserved in all IMPDH genes, in all species examined, including bacteria, suggesting that this mutation is highly deleterious. Subsequent screening of probands from 60 other adRP families revealed an additional family with this mutation, confirming its association with retinitis pigmentosa and the relatively high frequency of this mutation. Another IMPDH1 substitution, Val268Ile, was also observed in this cohort of patients but not in controls. IMPDH1 is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme, functioning as a homotetramer, which catalyzed the rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. As such, it plays an important role in cyclic nucleoside metabolism within photoreceptors. Several classes of drugs are known to affect IMPDH isoenzymes, including nucleotide and NAD analogs, suggesting that small-molecule therapy may be available, one day, for RP10 patients.
Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome is a progressive hematuric glomerulonephritis characterized by glomerular basement membrane abnormalities and associated with mutations in either the COL4A3 or the COL4A4 gene, which encode the alpha3 and alpha4 type IV collagen chains, respectively. To date, mutation screening in the two genes has been hampered by the lack of genomic structure information. We report here the complete characterization of the 48 exons of the COL4A4 gene, a comprehensive gene screen, and the subsequent detection of 10 novel mutations in eight patients diagnosed with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome. Furthermore, we identified a glycine to alanine substitution in the collagenous domain that is apparently silent in the heterozygous carriers, in 11. 5% of all control individuals, and in one control individual homozygous for this glycine substitution. There has been no previous finding of a glycine substitution that is not associated with any obvious phenotype in homozygous individuals.
Autosomal recessive familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus with continued secretion of mutant weakly active vasopressin.
Autosomal recessive transmission of hemophilia A due to a von Willebrand factor mutation.
Autotaxin, a potent human tumor cell motility-stimulating exophosphodiesterase, was isolated and cloned from the human teratocarcinoma cell line NTera2D1. The deduced amino acid sequence for the teratocarcinoma autotaxin has 94% identity to the melanoma-derived protein, 90% identity to rat brain phosphodiesterase I/nucleotide pyrophosphatase (PD-I alpha), and 44% identity to the plasma cell membrane marker PC-I. Utilizing polymerase chain reaction screening of the CEPH YAC library, we localized the autotaxin gene to human chromosome 8q23-24. Northern blot analysis of relative mRNA from multiple human tissues revealed that autotaxin mRNA steady state expression is most abundant in brain, placenta, ovary, and small intestine.
Availability of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in assessment of drug potential for QT prolongation.
Azathioprine treatment benefited 19 (66%) out of 29 patients suffering from severe psoriasis. Haematological complications were not troublesome and results of biochemical liver function tests remained normal. Minimal cholestasis was seen in two cases and portal fibrosis of a reversible degree in eight. Liver biopsies should be undertaken at regular intervals if azathioprine therapy is continued so that structural liver damage may be detected at an early and reversible stage.
Azathioprine-induced suicidal erythrocyte death.
Azelastine, a novel antiallergic medication, was compared with chlorpheniramine maleate and placebo for efficacy and safety in the treatment of spring allergic rhinitis in a multicenter, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-groups study. One hundred fifty-five subjects participated. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 60 years of age and had at least a 2-year history of spring allergic rhinitis, confirmed by positive skin test to spring aeroallergens. Medications were given four times daily; the azelastine groups received 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg in the morning and evening with placebo in the early and late afternoon; the chlorpheniramine group received 4.0 mg four times daily. Daily subject symptom cards were completed during a screening period to assess pretreatment symptoms and during a 4-week treatment period while subjects received study medications. Individual symptoms, total symptoms, and major symptoms were compared to determine efficacy of medication. Elicited, volunteered, and observed adverse experiences were recorded for each subject and compared among groups. Vital signs, body weights, serum chemistry values, complete blood cell counts, urine studies, and electrocardiograms were obtained for each subject and compared among groups. Symptoms relief in the group receiving the highest concentration of azelastine (2.0 mg twice daily) was statistically greater than in the placebo group during all weeks of the study. Lower doses of azelastine were statistically more effective than placebo only during portions of the first 3 weeks of the study. In contrast, although the chlorpheniramine group did have fewer symptoms than the placebo group during the study, the difference never reached statistical significance during any week of the study. There were no serious side effects in any of the treatment groups. Drowsiness and altered taste perception were increased significantly over placebo only in the high-dose azelastine group. Azelastine appears to be a safe, efficacious medication for seasonal allergic rhinitis.
Azidothymidine (AZT)-induced anemia in mice can be reversed by the administration of IGF-IL-3 (fusion protein of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II) and interleukin 3). Although interleukin 3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin (EPO) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro, injection of IGF-IL-3 and EPO in AZT-treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma EPO levels as compared to animals treated with IGF-IL-3 or EPO alone. We tested the hypothesis that the antagonistic effect of IL-3 and EPO on erythroid cells may be mediated by endothelial cells. Bovine liver erythroid cells were cultured on monolayers of human bone marrow endothelial cells previously treated with EPO and IGF-IL-3. There was a significant reduction of thymidine incorporation into both erythroid and endothelial cells in cultures pre-treated with IGF-IL-3 and EPO. Endothelial cell culture supernatants separated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation from cells treated with EPO and IL-3 significantly reduced thymidine incorporation into erythroid cells as compared to identical fractions obtained from the media of cells cultured with EPO alone. These results suggest that endothelial cells treated simultaneously with EPO and IL-3 have a negative effect on erythroid cell production.
BACKGROUND Allelic loss of chromosome 18q predicts a poor outcome in patients with stage II colorectal cancer. Although the specific gene inactivated by this allelic loss has not been elucidated, the DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) gene is a candidate. We investigated whether the expression of the DCC protein in tumor cells is a prognostic marker in colorectal carcinoma. METHODS The expression of DCC was evaluated immunohistochemically in 132 paraffin-embedded samples from patients with curatively resected stage II and III colorectal carcinomas. The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to adjust for covariates including age, sex, tumor site, degree of tumor differentiation, and use of adjuvant therapy. RESULTS The expression of DCC was a strong positive predictive factor for survival in both stage II and stage III colorectal carcinomas. In patients with stage II disease whose tumors expressed DCC, the five-year survival rate was 94. 3 percent, whereas in patients with DCC-negative tumors, the survival rate was 61. 6 percent (P < 0. 001). In patients with stage III disease, the respective survival rates were 59. 3 percent and 33. 2 percent (P = 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS DCC is a prognostic marker in patients with stage II or stage III colorectal cancer. In stage II colorectal carcinomas, the absence of DCC identifies a subgroup of patients with lesions that behave like stage III cancers. These findings may thus have therapeutic implications in this group of patients
BACKGROUND Families with a high incidence of hereditary breast cancer, and subsequently shown to have terminating mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, appear to have a higher incidence of prostate cancer among male relatives. We aimed to determine whether the common germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in Ashkenazi Jewish men predisposed them to prostate cancer. METHODS We examined genomic DNA from 83 (for BRCA1 185delAG) or 82 (for BRCA2 6174delT) Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients, most of whom were treated at a relatively young age, for the most common germline mutation in each gene seen in the Ashkenazi population. RESULTS Our study should have been able to detect a 4-5-fold increase in the risk of prostate cancer due to mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2. However, only one (1. 15%; 95% confidence interval, 0-3. 6%) of the patients was heterozygous for the BRCA1 mutant allele, and only two were heterozygous for the BRCA2 mutation (2. 4%; 95% confidence interval, 0-6. 2%). CONCLUSIONS The incidence of each of the germline mutations in these prostate cancer patients closely matched their incidence (about 1%) in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population. This suggests that unlike cases of breast and ovarian cancers, mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 do not significantly predispose men to prostate cancer
BACKGROUND Mutations in the gene encoding the human cardiac Na (+) channel alpha-subunit (hH1) are responsible for chromosome 3-linked congenital long-QT syndrome (LQT3) and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). An auxiliary beta (1) -subunit, widely expressed in excitable tissues, shifts the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation toward more negative potentials and restores normal gating kinetics of brain and skeletal muscle Na (+) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes but has little if any functional effect on the cardiac isoform. Here, we characterize the altered effects of a human beta (1) -subunit (hbeta (1)) on the heterologously expressed hH1 mutation (T1620M) previously associated with IVF. METHODS AND RESULTS When expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes, T1620M exhibited no persistent currents, in contrast to the LQT3 mutant channels, but the midpoint of steady-state inactivation (V (1/2)) was significantly shifted toward more positive potentials than for wild-type hH1. Coexpression of hbeta (1) did not significantly alter current decay or recovery from inactivation of wild-type hH1; however, it further shifted the V (1/2) and accelerated the recovery from inactivation of T1620M. Oocyte macropatch analysis revealed that the activation kinetics of T1620M were normal. CONCLUSIONS It is suggested that coexpression of hbeta (1) exposes a more severe functional defect that results in a greater overlap in the relationship between channel inactivation and activation (window current) in T1620M, which is proposed to be a potential pathophysiological mechanism of IVF in vivo. One possible explanation for our finding is an altered alpha-/beta (1) -subunit association in the mutant..
BACKGROUND Recently, mutations in the retinal degeneration slow (rds) gene which codes for peripherin-rds have been implicated as a cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Because this gene is expressed in both rods and cones, mutations in the rds gene might be expected to cause degeneration affecting either the scotopic or photopic systems. Mutations at codon 172 of the rds gene have been identified in three families with autosomal dominantly inherited, progressive macular dystrophy. METHODS Affected individuals underwent ophthalmic examination, scotopic perimetry, dark adaptometry, measurement of color-contrast sensitivity, and electroretinography to characterize the photoreceptor dysfunction. RESULTS In all but one affected member, symptoms of progressive central visual loss developed in the third or fourth decade of life accompanied by central scotoma and well-demarcated atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris of the macula. In general, cone and rod thresholds were elevated, and color-contrast sensitivity was absent in the central visual field. Peripherally, the scotopic sensitivities were normal, as was the recovery from bleach. Cone electroretinograms were diminished in amplitude, and delayed in all affected adults except one. Rod electroretinograms were normal or near normal in amplitude, and had normal implicit times. Affected asymptomatic children had macular changes, abnormal color-contrast sensitivity, and reduced pattern and cone electroretinograms. CONCLUSION These results indicate that mutations in the rds gene can be expressed as a macular dystrophy, with evidence of primary cone dysfunction and preservation of peripheral rod function..
BACKGROUND To define the incidence of BRCA1 mutations among patients seen in clinics that evaluate the risk of breast cancer, we analyzed DNA samples from women seen in this setting and constructed probability tables to provide estimates of the likelihood of finding a BRCA1 mutation in individual families. METHODS Clinical information, family histories, and blood for DNA analysis were obtained from 263 women with breast cancer. Conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing were used to identify BRCA1 mutations. RESULTS BRCA1 mutations were identified in 16 percent of women with a family history of breast cancer. Only 7 percent of women from families with a history of breast cancer but not ovarian cancer had BRCA1 mutations. The rates were higher among women from families with a history of both breast and ovarian cancer. Among family members, an average age of less than 55 years at the diagnosis of breast cancer, the presence of ovarian cancer, the presence of breast and ovarian cancer in the same woman, and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry were all associated with an increased risk of detecting a BRCA1 mutation. No association was found between the presence of bilateral breast cancer or the number of breast cancers in a family and the detection of a BRCA1 mutation, or between the position of the mutation in the BRCA1 gene and the presence of ovarian cancer in a family. CONCLUSIONS Among women with breast cancer and a family history of the disease, the percentage with BRCA1 coding-region mutations is less than the 45 percent predicted by genetic-linkage analysis. These results suggest that even in a referral clinic specializing in screening women from high-risk families, the majority of tests for BRCA1 mutations will be negative and therefore uninformative..
BACKGROUND Women with mutations in either the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene have a high lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. Oral contraceptives protect against ovarian cancer in general, but it is not known whether they also protect against hereditary forms of ovarian cancer. METHODS We enrolled 207 women with hereditary ovarian cancer and 161 of their sisters as controls in a case-control study. All the patients carried a pathogenic mutation in either BRCA1 (179 women) or BRCA2 (28 women). The control women were enrolled regardless of whether or not they had either mutation. Lifetime histories of oral-contraceptive use were obtained by interview or by written questionnaire and were compared between patients and control women, after adjustment for year of birth and parity. RESULTS The adjusted odds ratio for ovarian cancer associated with any past use of oral contraceptives was 0. 5 (95 percent confidence interval, 0. 3 to 0. 8). The risk decreased with increasing duration of use (P for trend, < 0. 001); use for six or more years was associated with a 60 percent reduction in risk. Oral-contraceptive use protected against ovarian cancer both for carriers of the BRCA1 mutation (odds ratio, 0. 5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 3 to 0. 9) and for carriers of the BRCA2 mutation (odds ratio, 0. 4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 2 to 1. 1). CONCLUSIONS Oral-contraceptive use may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in women with pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene
BACKGROUND X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an inherited disease characterized by progressive neurologic dysfunction, occasionally associated with adrenal insufficiency. The classic form of ALD usually has onset in childhood (childhood cerebral ALD), with rapid neurologic deterioration leading to a vegetative state. Adult-onset cerebral ALD also presents with rapidly progressive neurologic dysfunction. Milder phenotypes such as adrenomyeloneuropathy and Addison disease only also have been recognized. Despite discovery of the causative gene, a molecular basis for the diverse clinical presentations remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES To conduct mutational analyses in 29 Japanese patients with ALD from 29 unrelated families, to obtain knowledge of the spectrum of mutations in this gene, and to study genotype-phenotype correlations in Japanese patients. METHODS The 29 patients comprised 13 patients with childhood cerebral ALD, 11 patients with adult-onset cerebral ALD, and 5 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy. We conducted detailed mutational analyses of 29 unrelated Japanese patients with ALD by genomic Southern blot analysis and direct nucleotide sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction products derived from total RNA that was extracted from cultured skin fibroblasts, lymphoblastoid cells, or peripheral blood leukocytes. RESULTS Three patients with adult-onset cerebral ALD were identified as having large genomic rearrangements. The remaining 26 patients were identified as having 21 independent mutations, including 12 novel mutations resulting in small nucleotide alterations in the ALD gene. Eighteen (69%) of 26 mutations were missense mutations. Most missense mutations involved amino acids conserved in homologous gene products, including PMP70, mALDRP, and Pxa1p. The AG dinucleotide deletion at position 1081-1082, which has been reported previously to be the most common mutation in white patients (12% -17%), was also identified as the most common mutation in Japanese patients (12%). All phenotypes were associated with mutations resulting in protein truncation or subtle amino acid changes. There were no differences in phenotypic expressions between missense mutations involving conserved amino acids and those involving nonconserved amino acids. CONCLUSIONS There are no obvious correlations between the phenotypes of patients with ALD and their genotypes, suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors modify the phenotypic expressions of ALD..
BACKGROUND X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is a relatively rare vitreoretinal dystrophy that causes visual loss in young men. Recently, a gene responsible for this disease, designated XLRS1, was identified, and several deleterious gene mutations were reported. OBJECTIVE To analyze Japanese patients clinically diagnosed as having XLRS formutational changes in the XLRS1 gene. METHODS Ten patients with XLRS underwent full ophthalmologic examination, including slitlamp biomicroscopy and dilated funduscopy. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes, and all exons of the XLRS1 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed using a direct sequencing method. RESULTS Point mutations in the XLRS1 gene were identified in all 10 patients. The mutations were identical in each of 2 pairs of brothers. Six of the point mutations represented missense mutations, 1 was a nonsense mutation, and 1 was a frameshift mutation. Five of the mutations are newly reported herein. CONCLUSIONS The discovery of new point mutations in this study increases the available information regarding the spectrum of genetic abnormalities and clinical manifestations of XLRS. However, the limited data failed to reveal a correlation between mutation and disease phenotype. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Identification of mutations in the XLRS1 gene and expanded information on clinical manifestations will facilitate early diagnosis, appropriate early therapy, and genetic counseling regarding the prognosis of XLRS..
BACKGROUND & AIMS Israeli Jews of European birth, i. e., Ashkenazim, have the highest colorectal cancer incidence of any Israeli ethnic group. The I1307K APC gene variant was found in 6. 1% of American Jews, 28% of their familial colorectal cancer cases, but not in non-Jews. We assessed the I1307K prevalence in Israeli Jews of differing ethnic origin and risk for colorectal cancer. METHODS DNA samples from 500 unrelated Jews of European or non-European origin, with or without a personal and/or family history of neoplasia, were examined for the I1307K variant by the allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) method. RESULTS In persons at average risk for colorectal cancer, I1307K was found in 5. 0% of 120 European and 1. 6% of 188 non-European Jews (P = 0. 08). It occurred in 15. 4% of 52 Ashkenazi Israelis with familial cancer (P = 0. 02) and was not detected in 51 non-European Jews at increased cancer risk. Colorectal neoplasia occurred personally or in the families of 13 of 20 Ashkenazi I1307K carriers, 8 of whom also had a personal or family history of noncolonic neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS The I1307K APC variant may represent a susceptibility gene for colorectal, or other, cancers in Ashkenazi Jews, and partially explains the higher incidence of colorectal cancer in European Israelis.
BACKGROUND & AIMS The chromosome region 18q21 has been shown to be frequently deleted in colorectal cancers, and such frequent allelic loss is a hallmark of the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene. The DPC4 gene, which is located at 18q21, has been identified as a tumor-suppressor gene from examination of pancreatic cancers. The aim of the present study was to determine if it might also be altered in colorectal cancers. METHODS Mutation analyses of the DPC4 gene were performed on complementary DNA samples from 31 primary colorectal cancer specimens using a combination of polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and DNA sequencing. RESULTS Four missense mutations producing amino acid substitutions and a somatic 12-base pair deletion in the coding region of the DPC4 gene were detected in the 31 cancers (16%; 5 of 31). CONCLUSIONS The DPC4 gene may play a role as a tumor-suppressor gene in a fraction of colorectal cancers; however, while allelic loss at 18q21 is very often seen in colorectal cancers, only a minority show DPC4 mutations, suggesting that there might be another tumor-suppressor gene in this chromosome region..
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Progress in the understanding of susceptibility factors to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and outcome predictability are hampered by the lack of systematic programs to detect bona fide cases. METHODS: A cooperative network was created in 1994 in Spain to identify all suspicions of DILI following a prospective structured report form. The liver damage was characterized according to hepatocellular, cholestatic, and mixed laboratory criteria and to histologic criteria when available. Further evaluation of causality assessment was centrally performed. RESULTS: Since April 1994 to August 2004, 461 out of 570 submitted cases, involving 505 drugs, were deemed to be related to DILI. The antiinfective group of drugs was the more frequently incriminated, amoxicillin-clavulanate accounting for the 12.8% of the whole series. The hepatocellular pattern of damage was the most common (58%), was inversely correlated with age (P < .0001), and had the worst outcome (Cox regression, P < .034). Indeed, the incidence of liver transplantation and death in this group was 11.7% if patients had jaundice at presentation, whereas the corresponding figure was 3.8% in nonjaundiced patients (P < .04). Factors associated with the development of fulminant hepatic failure were female sex (OR = 25; 95% CI: 4.1-151; P < .0001), hepatocellular damage (OR = 7.9; 95% CI: 1.6-37; P < .009), and higher baseline plasma bilirubin value (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.09-1.22; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with drug-induced hepatocellular jaundice have 11.7% chance of progressing to death or transplantation. Amoxicillin-clavulanate stands out as the most common drug related to DILI.
BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Undersized mitral annuloplasty (MAP) is effective in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and functional mitral regurgitation (MR) since, as well as addressing the MR, the MAP may also reshape the dilated left ventricular (LV) base. However, the direct benefits of this possible reshaping on LV function in the absence of underlying MR remain incompletely understood. The study aim was to identify these benefits in a canine model of acute heart failure. METHODS: Six dogs underwent MAP with a prosthetic band on the posterior mitral annulus, using four mattress sutures. The sutures were passed individually through four tourniquets and exteriorized untied via the left atriotomy. Sonomicrometry crystals were implanted around the mitral annulus and left ventricle to measure geometry and regional function. Acute heart failure was induced by propranolol and volume loading after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass; an absence of MR was confirmed by echocardiography. MAP was accomplished by cinching the tourniquets. Data were acquired at baseline, after induction of acute heart failure, and after MAP. RESULTS: MAP decreased mitral annular dimensions in both commissure-commissure and septal-lateral directions. Concomitantly, the diastolic diameter of the LV base and LV sphericity decreased (i.e., improved) from 37.4 +/- 9.3 to 35.9 +/- 10 mm (p = 0.063), and from 67.9 +/- 18.6% to 65.3 +/- 18.9% (p = 0.016), respectively. Decreases were evident in both LV end-diastolic pressure (from 17 +/- 7 to 15 +/- 6 mmHg, p = 0.0480 and Tau (from 48 +/- 8 to 45 +/- 8 ms, p <0.01), while fractional shortening at the LV base increased from 7.7 +/- 4.5% to 9.4 +/- 4.5% (p = 0.045). After MAP, increases were identified in both cardiac output (from 1.54 +/- 0.57 to 1.65 +/- 0.57 1/min) and Emax (from 1.86 +/- 0.9 to 2.41 +/- 1.31 mmHg/ml). CONCLUSION: The data acquired suggest that isolated MAP may have certain benefits on LV dimension/function in acute heart failure, even in the absence of MR. However, further investigations are warranted in a model of chronic heart failure.
BACKGROUND AND AIM: Interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C produces hemolytic anemia. This study was conducted to identify the factors contributing to ribavirin-induced anemia. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with chronic hepatitis C who received interferon-alpha-2b at a dose of 6 MU administered intramuscularly for 24 weeks in combination with ribavirin administered orally at a dose of 600 mg or 800 mg participated in the study. A hemoglobin concentration of <10 g/dL was defined as ribavirin-induced anemia. RESULTS: Ribavirin-induced anemia occurred in 18 (20.5%) patients during treatment. A 2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin concentrations in patients with anemia was observed at week 2 after the start of treatment. The hemoglobin concentration in patients with > or =2 g/dL decrease at week 2 was observed to be significantly lower even after week 2 than in patients with <2 g/dL decrease (P < 0.01). A significant relationship was observed between the rate of reduction of hemoglobin concentrations at week 2 and the severity of anemia (P < 0.01). Such factors as sex (female), age (> or =60 years old), and the ribavirin dose by body weight (12 mg/kg or more) were significant by univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Careful administration is necessary in patients > or =60 years old, in female patients, and in patients receiving a ribavirin dose of 12 mg/kg or more. Patients who experience a fall in hemoglobin concentrations of 2 g/dL or more at week 2 after the start of treatment should be monitored with particular care.
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies on rodents have suggested that catecholamines stimulate proliferation of the intestinal epithelium through activation of alpha(2) adrenoceptors located on crypt cells. The occurrence of this effect awaits demonstration in humans and the molecular mechanisms involved have not yet been elucidated. Here, we examined the effect of alpha(2) agonists on a clone of Caco2 cells expressing the human alpha(2A) adrenoceptor. METHODS: Cells were transfected with a bicistronic plasmid containing the alpha2C10 and neomycin phosphotransferase genes. G418 resistant clones were assayed for receptor expression using radioligand binding. Receptor functionality was assessed by testing its ability to couple Gi proteins and to inhibit cAMP production. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation was followed by western blot, and cell proliferation was estimated by measuring protein and DNA content. RESULTS: Permanent transfection of Caco2 cells allowed us to obtain a clone (Caco2-3B) expressing alpha(2A) adrenoceptors at a density similar to that found in normal human intestinal epithelium. Caco2-3B retained morphological features and brush border enzyme expression characteristic of enterocytic differentiation. The receptor was coupled to Gi2/Gi3 proteins and its stimulation caused marked diminution of forskolin induced cAMP production. Treatment of Caco2-3B with UK14304 (alpha(2) agonist) induced a rapid increase in the phosphorylation state of MAPK, extracellular regulated protein kinase 1 (Erk1), and 2 (Erk2). This event was totally abolished in pertussis toxin treated cells and in the presence of kinase inhibitors (genistein or PD98059). It was unaffected by protein kinase C downregulation but correlated with a transient increase in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, sustained exposure of Caco2-3B to UK14304 resulted in modest but significant acceleration of cell proliferation. None of these effects was observed in the parental cell line Caco2. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in the present study support a regulatory role for alpha(2) adrenoceptors in intestinal cell proliferation.
BACKGROUND AND METHODS Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene on chromosome 6, elevated serum transferrin saturation, and excess iron deposits throughout the body. To assess the prevalence and clinical expression of the HFE gene, we conducted a population-based study in Busselton, Australia. In 1994, we obtained blood samples for the determination of serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels and the presence or absence of the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation (which may contribute to increased hepatic iron levels) in 3011 unrelated white adults. We evaluated all subjects who had persistently elevated transferrin-saturation values (45 percent or higher) or were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. We recommended liver biopsy for subjects with serum ferritin levels of 300 ng per milliliter or higher. The subjects were followed for up to four years. RESULTS Sixteen of the subjects (0. 5 percent) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, and 424 (14. 1 percent) were heterozygous. The serum transferrin saturation was 45 percent or higher in 15 of the 16 who were homozygous; in 1 subject it was 43 percent. Four of the homozygous subjects had previously been given a diagnosis of hemochromatosis, and 12 had not. Seven of these 12 patients had elevated serum ferritin levels in 1994; 6 of the 7 had further increases in 1998, and 1 had a decrease, although the value remained elevated. The serum ferritin levels in the four other homozygous patients remained in the normal range. Eleven of the 16 homozygous subjects underwent liver biopsy; 3 had hepatic fibrosis, and 1, who had a history of excessive alcohol consumption, had cirrhosis and mild microvesicular steatosis. Eight of the 16 homozygous subjects had clinical findings that were consistent with the presence of hereditary hemochromatosis, such as hepatomegaly, skin pigmentation, and arthritis. CONCLUSIONS In a population of white adults of northern European ancestry, 0. 5 percent were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. However, only half of those who were homozygous had clinical features of hemochromatosis, and one quarter had serum ferritin levels that remained normal over a four-year period.
BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The plasma cholesteryl-ester transfer protein (CETP) catalyzes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to other lipoproteins. We recently described a Japanese family with increased HDL levels and CETP deficiency due to a splicing defect of the CETP gene. To assess the frequency and phenotype of this condition, we screened 11 additional families with high HDL levels by means of a radioimmunoassay for CETP and DNA analysis. RESULTS. We found the same CETP gene mutation in four families from three different regions of Japan. Analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms of the mutant CETP allele showed that all probands were homozygous for the identical haplotype. Family members homozygous for CETP deficiency (n = 10) had moderate hypercholesterolemia (mean total cholesterol level [+/- SD], 7. 01 +/- 0. 83 mmol per liter), markedly increased levels of HDL cholesterol (4. 24 +/- 1. 01 mmol per liter) and apolipoprotein A-I, and decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1. 99 +/- 0. 80 mmol per liter) and apolipoprotein B. Members heterozygous for the deficiency (n = 20), whose CETP levels were in the lower part of the normal range, had moderately increased levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I and an increased ratio of HDL subclass 2 to HDL subclass 3, as compared with unaffected family members (1. 5 +/- 0. 8 vs. 0. 7 +/- 0. 4). CETP deficiency was not found in six unrelated subjects with elevated HDL cholesterol levels who were from different parts of the United States. CONCLUSIONS. CETP deficiency appears to be a frequent cause of increased HDL levels in the population of Japan, possibly because of a founder effect. The results that we observed in heterozygotes suggest that CETP normally plays a part in the regulation of levels of HDL subclass 2. There was no evidence of premature atherosclerosis in the families with CETP deficiency. In fact, the lipoprotein profile of persons with CETP deficiency is potentially antiatherogenic and may be associated with an increased life span.
BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The prevention of Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis, type 1) depends on the identification of carriers of the gene for this autosomal recessive disorder. We compared the enzyme-based test widely used in screening for Tay-Sachs disease with a test based on analysis of DNA. We developed methods to detect the three mutations in the HEXA gene that occur with high frequency among Ashkenazi Jews two mutations cause infantile Tay-Sachs disease, and the third causes the adult-onset form of the disease. DNA segments containing these mutation sites were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction and analyzed for the presence of the mutations. RESULTS. Among 62 Ashkenazi obligate carriers of Tay-Sachs disease, the three specific mutations accounted for all but one of the mutant alleles (98 percent). In 216 Ashkenazi carriers identified by the enzyme test, DNA analysis showed that 177 (82 percent) had one of the identified mutations. Of the 177, 79 percent had the exon 11 insertion mutation, 18 percent had the intron 12 splice-junction mutation, and 3 percent had the less severe exon 7 mutation associated with adult-onset disease. The results of the enzyme tests in the 39 subjects (18 percent) who were defined as carriers but in whom DNA analysis did not identify a mutant allele were probably false positive (although there remains some possibility of unidentified mutations). In addition, of 152 persons defined as noncarriers by the enzyme-based test, 1 was identified as a carrier by DNA analysis (i. e e., a false negative enzyme-test result). CONCLUSIONS. The increased specificity and predictive value of the DNA-based test make it a useful adjunct to the diagnostic tests currently used to screen for carriers of Tay-Sachs disease.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with sevoflurane, postoperative nausea and vomiting occurs frequently. Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia. METHODS: This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients. Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl. RESULTS: Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and/or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl-dexamethasone, respectively, to 5% (P = 0.013). Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012). Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids, reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034). Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl. Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane-sparing effect and increased respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia. CONCLUSION: As fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects, it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Mutations of the peripherin/RDS gene have been reported in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, pattern macular dystrophy, and retinitis punctata albescens. We report herein the occurrence of three separate phenotypes within a single family with a novel 3-base pair deletion of codon 153 or 154 of the peripherin/RDS gene. DESIGN Case reports with clinical features, fluorescein angiography, kinetic perimetry, electrophysiological studies, and molecular genetics. SETTING University medical centers. PATIENTS A 75-year-old woman, her two daughters (aged 44 and 50 years), and her 49-year-old son were screened for peripherin/RDS mutations because of the presence of multiple phenotypes within the same family. RESULTS The mother presented at age 63 years with a profoundly abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) and adult-onset retinitis pigmentosa that progressed dramatically over 12 years, with marked loss of peripheral visual field. One daughter developed pattern macular dystrophy at age 31 years. At age 44 years, her ERG was moderately abnormal but her clinical disease was limited to the macula. Another daughter presented at age 42 years with macular degeneration and over 10 years developed the clinical picture of fundus flavimaculatus. Her peripheral visual field was preserved but her ERG was moderately abnormal. The son had onset of macular degeneration at age 44 years. Pericentral scotomas were present and the ERG was markedly abnormal. Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate pigment epithelial transmission defects. CONCLUSIONS A 3-base pair deletion of codon 153 or 154 of the peripherin/RDS gene can produce clinically disparate phenotypes even within the same family..
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Central nervous system and cardiac toxicity following the administration of local anesthetics is a recognized complication of regional anesthesia. Levobupivacaine, the pure S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine, was developed to improve the cardiac safety profile of bupivacaine. We describe 2 cases of grand mal seizures following accidental intravascular injection of levobupivacaine. CASE REPORT: Two patients presenting for elective orthopedic surgery of the lower limb underwent blockade of the lumbar plexus via the posterior approach. Immediately after the administration of levobupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine 2.5 microgram/mL, the patients developed grand mal seizures, despite negative aspiration for blood and no clinical signs of intravenous epinephrine administration. The seizures were successfully treated with sodium thiopental in addition to succinylcholine in 1 patient. Neither patient developed signs of cardiovascular toxicity. Both patients were treated preoperatively with beta-adrenergic antagonist medications, which may have masked the cardiovascular signs of the unintentional intravascular administration of levobupivacaine with epinephrine. CONCLUSIONS: Although levobupivacaine may have a safer cardiac toxicity profile than racemic bupivacaine, if adequate amounts of levobupivacaine reach the circulation, it will result in convulsions. Plasma concentrations sufficient to result in central nervous system toxicity did not produce manifestations of cardiac toxicity in these 2 patients.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This report aimed to present a case of lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy (LACNP) that occurred after a steroid injection in the lateral epicondyle to treat lateral epicondylitis in a 40-year-old woman. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A 40-year-old woman presented with decreased sensation and paresthesia over her right lateral forearm; the paresthesia had occurred after a steroid injection in the right lateral epicondyle 3 months before. Her sensation of light touch and pain was diminished over the lateral side of the right forearm and wrist area. RESULTS: The sensory action potential amplitude of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) (6.2 uV) was lower than that of the left (13.1 uV). The difference of amplitude between both sides was significant because there was more than a 50% reduction. She was diagnosed with right LACNP (mainly axonal involvement) on the basis of the clinical manifestation and the electrodiagnostic findings. Her symptoms improved through physical therapy but persisted to some degree. CONCLUSION: This report describes the case of a woman with LACNP that developed after a steroid injection for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. An electrodiagnostic study, including a nerve conduction study of the LACN, was helpful to diagnose right LACNP and to find the passage of the LACN on the lateral epicondyle.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleeds (MB) are potential risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it is unclear if they are a contraindication to using antithrombotic drugs. Insights could be gained by pooling data on MB frequency stratified by antithrombotic use in cohorts with ICH and ischemic stroke (IS)/transient ischemic attack (TIA). METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished data from cohorts with stroke or TIA to compare the presence of MB in: (1) antithrombotic users vs nonantithrombotic users with ICH; (2) antithrombotic users vs nonusers with IS/TIA; and (3) ICH vs ischemic events stratified by antithrombotic use. We also analyzed published and unpublished follow-up data to determine the risk of ICH in antithrombotic users with MB. RESULTS: In a pooled analysis of 1460 ICH and 3817 IS/TIA, MB were more frequent in ICH vs IS/TIA in all treatment groups, but the excess increased from 2.8 (odds ratio; range, 2.3-3.5) in nonantithrombotic users to 5.7 (range, 3.4-9.7) in antiplatelet users and 8.0 (range, 3.5-17.8) in warfarin users (P difference=0.01). There was also an excess of MB in warfarin users vs nonusers with ICH (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.4; P<0.001) but none in warfarin users with IS/TIA (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.7; P=0.33; P difference=0.01). There was a smaller excess of MB in antiplatelet users vs nonusers with ICH (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.3; P<0.001), but findings were similar for antiplatelet users with IS/TIA (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7; P<0.001; P difference=0.25). In pooled follow-up data for 768 antithrombotic users, presence of MB at baseline was associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent ICH (OR, 12.1; 95% CI, 3.4-42.5; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The excess of MB in warfarin users with ICH compared to other groups suggests that MB increase the risk of warfarin-associated ICH. Limited prospective data corroborate these findings, but larger prospective studies are urgently required.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Intravenous Nimodipine West European Stroke Trial (INWEST) found a correlation between nimodipine-induced reduction in blood pressure (BP) and an unfavorable outcome in acute stroke. We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of BP reduction. METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) nimodipine (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) nimodipine (n=94). The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-five patients were included in this analysis (n=92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively). Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days. In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation between DBP reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high-dose group (beta=0.49, P=0. 048). Patients with a DBP reduction of > or =20% in the high-dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable death or dependency (Barthel Index <60) (n/N=25/26, OR 10. 16, 95% CI 1.02 to 101.74) and death alone (n/N=9/26, OR 4.336, 95% CI 1.131 16.619) compared with all placebo patients (n/N=62/92 and 14/92, respectively). There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: DBP, but not SBP, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high-dose nimodipine after acute stroke. For low-dose nimodipine, the results were not conclusive. These results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of nimodipine.
BACKGROUND. Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer in some families. However, little is known about the contribution of BRCA1 mutations to breast cancer in the general population. We analyzed DNA samples from women enrolled in a population-based study of early-onset breast cancer to assess the spectrum and frequency of germ-line BRCA1 mutations in young women with breast cancer. METHODS. We studied 80 women in whom breast cancer was diagnosed before the age of 35, and who were not selected on the basis of family history. Genomic DNA was studied for BRCA1 mutations by analysis involving single-strand conformation polymorphisms and with allele-specific assays. Alterations were defined by DNA sequencing. RESULTS. Germ-line BRCA1 mutations were identified in 6 of the 80 women. Four additional rare sequence variants of unknown functional importance were also identified. Two of the mutations and three of the rare sequence variants were found among the 39 women who reported no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. None of the mutations and only one of the rare variants was identified in a reference population of 73 unrelated subjects. CONCLUSIONS. Alterations in BRCA1 were identified in approximately 10 percent of this cohort of young women with breast cancer. The risk of harboring a mutation was not limited to women with family histories of breast or ovarian cancer. These results represent a minimal estimate of the frequency of BRCA1 mutations in this population. Comprehensive methods of identifying BRCA1 mutations and understanding their importance will be needed before testing of women in the general population can be undertaken..
BACKGROUND/AIMS The development of colorectal cancer and a variable range of extracolonic manifestations in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is the result of the dominant inheritance of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations. In this study, direct mutation analysis of the APC gene was performed to determine genotype-phenotype correlations for nine extracolonic manifestations and to investigate the incidence of APC mutations in non-FAP colorectal cancer. METHODS The APC gene was analysed in 190 unrelated FAP and 15 non-FAP colorectal cancer patients using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, the protein truncation test, and direct sequencing. RESULTS Chain terminating signals were only identified in patients belonging to the FAP group (105 patients). Amino acid changes were identified in four patients, three of whom belonged to the non-FAP group of colorectal cancer patients. Genotype-phenotype correlations identified significant differences in the nature of certain extracolonic manifestations in FAP patients belonging to three mutation subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Extended genotype-phenotype correlations made in this study may have the potential to determine the most appropriate surveillance and prophylactic treatment regimens for those patients with mutations associated with life threatening conditions. This study also provided evidence for the pathological nature of amino acid changes in APC associated with both FAP and non-FAP colorectal cancer patients..
BACKGROUND/AIMS: Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas/Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure. The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure. METHODOLOGY: Serum levels of sFas (soluble Fas) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma were also determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure (median, 26.8 U/mL; range, 6.9-52.7 U/mL) compared to the normal controls (median, 8.6 U/mL; range, 6.5-12.0 U/mL, P < 0.0001). Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose (median, 28.7 U/mL; range, 12.8-52.7 U/mL, n = 17) than those due to non-A to E hepatitis (median, 12.5 U/mL; range, 6.9-46.0 U/mL, n = 7, P < 0.01). There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients. A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.613, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas-mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss.
BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is still unclear what happens in the glomerulus when proteinuria starts. Using puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN) rats, we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte-associated molecules nephrin, a-actinin, dendrin, and plekhh2, the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes. METHODS: Using immune stainings, semiquantitative measurement was performed under the electron microscope. Permeability was assessed using isolated kidney perfusion with tracers. Possible effects of ACE inhibition were tested. RESULTS: By day 2, some patchy foot process effacement, but no proteinuria, appeared. The amount of nephrin was reduced in both diseased and normal areas. The other proteins showed few changes, which were limited to diseased areas. By day 4, foot process effacement was complete and proteinuria appeared in parallel with signs of size barrier damage. Nephrin decreased further, while dendrin and plekhh2 also decreased but a-actinin remained unchanged. ACE inhibition had no significant protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: PAN glomeruli already showed significant pathology by day 4, despite relatively mild proteinuria. This was preceded by altered nephrin expression, supporting its pivotal role in podocyte morphology. The novel proteins dendrin and plekhh2 were both reduced, suggesting roles in PAN, whereas a-actinin was unchanged.
BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently ribavirin has been found to inhibit angiogenesis and a number of angiogenesis inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib have been found to cause acute hemolysis. We aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis soluble markers which are modifiable and can help in developing strategies against anemia. METHODS: Fourteen patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus were treated by pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin. Serum hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis markers of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoetin-2 were investigated before and after therapy. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in haptoglobin levels at the end of the treatment period. Hemoglobin levels also decreased but insignificantly by treatment. In contrast with the literature, serum levels of angiogenesis factors did not change significantly by pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy. We found no correlation of angiogenesis soluble markers with either hemoglobin or haptoglobin. CONCLUSION: This is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and ribavirin induced anemia in patients with hepatitis C and we could not find any relation. Future research with larger number of patients is needed to find out modifiable factors that will improve the safety of ribavirin therapy.
BACKGROUND: A gene for Larsen syndrome was recently described, and mutations were reported in five cases. OBJECTIVE: To test whether mutations in this gene, FLNB, could explain the disease in our independent collection of sporadic and dominant Larsen syndrome cases; and to test whether mutations occurred in a non-random pattern. RESULTS: Missense mutations were found in each of five cases. Four of the five were new; one was reported in a sporadic case in the original Larsen syndrome study of five cases. All mutations from the two studies were compiled. Clustered mutations were observed within three filamin B protein domains: the calponin homology 2 domain, repeat 14, and repeat 15. This suggested that as few as five (of the total of 46) coding exons of FLNB could be screened to detect Larsen syndrome mutations. Four of these exons were screened in a sixth (sporadic) case and a previously reported G1691S substitution mutation detected. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in FLNB may be responsible for all cases of Larsen syndrome. They appear to occur in specific functional domains of the filamin B protein. This should simplify diagnostic screening of the FLNB gene. Analyses in larger patient series are warranted to quantify this. The study confirmed the extreme variability in clinical presentation and the presence of unaffected carriers. A molecular screen would be valuable for diagnosis and genetic counselling.
BACKGROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia (2%) and renal insufficiency (0%). Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone. METHODS: We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice. Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia (K(+) >5.0 mEq/L) or renal insufficiency (Cr >or=2.5 mg/dL), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case. Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared. RESULTS: Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (n = 33) or renal failure (n = 34). Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes, had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134). Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls. CONCLUSIONS: Spironolactone-induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously. This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta-blockers.
BACKGROUND: A transient leukoencephalopathy mimicking cerebrovascular accident has been described as a complication of chemotherapy, most commonly in recipients of intrathecal methotrexate for childhood leukaemia. Recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration. METHODS: We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke-like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy. We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data. Patients with cerebrovascular accidents were excluded. RESULTS: We identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate (intrathecal, systemic), 5-fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur, and capecitabine. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum, corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (available in 21/27 patients). Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories. Complete resolution of symptoms within 1-4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities. However, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences frequently revealed persistent white matter abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Several pathophysiological models of delayed leukoencephalopathy after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed. DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome.
BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen (paracetamol--P) and Nimesulide (N) are widely used analgesic-antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs. The rate of adverse hypersensitivity reactions to these agents is generally low. On the contrary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly involved in such reactions. Celecoxib (CE) is a novel drug, with high selectivity and affinity for COX-2 enzyme. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the tolerability of CE in a group of patients with documented history of adverse cutaneous reactions to P and N associated or not to classic NSAIDs. METHODS: We studied 9 patients with hypersensitivity to P and N with or without associated reactions to classic NSAIDs. The diagnosis of P and N-induced skin reactions was based in vivo challenge. The placebo was blindly administered at the beginning of each challenge. After three days, a cumulative dosage of 200 mg of CE in refracted doses were given. After 2-3 days, a single dose of 200 mg was administered. All patients were observed for 6 hours after each challenge, and controlled again after 24 hours to exclude delayed reactions. The challenge was considered positive if one or more of the following appeared: erythema, rush or urticaria-angioedema. RESULTS: No reaction was observed with placebo and eight patients (88.8%) tolerated CE. Only one patient developed a moderate angioedema of the lips. CONCLUSION: Only one hypersensitivity reaction to CE was documented among 9 P and N-highly NSAIDs intolerant patients. Thus, we conclude that CE is a reasonably safe alternative to be used in subjects who do not tolerate P and N.
BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the UK. Patients often consume the drug with suicidal intent or with a background of substance dependence. AIMS AND METHODS: We compared the severity of pretransplant illness, psychiatric co-morbidity, medical and psychosocial outcomes of all patients who had undergone liver transplantation (LT) emergently between 1999-2004 for acetaminophen-induced ALF (n=36) with age- and sex-matched patients undergoing emergent LT for non-acetaminophen-induced ALF (n=35) and elective LT for chronic liver disease (CLD, n=34). RESULTS: Acetaminophen-induced ALF patients undergoing LT had a greater severity of pre-LT illness reflected by higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and requirement for organ support compared with the other two groups. Twenty (56%) acetaminophen-induced ALF patients had a formal psychiatric diagnosis before LT (non-acetaminophen-induced ALF=0/35, CLD=2/34; P<0.01 for all) and nine (25%) had a previous suicide attempt. During follow-up (median 5 years), there were no significant differences in rejection (acute and chronic), graft failure or survival between the groups (acetaminophen-induced ALF 1 year 87%, 5 years 75%; non-acetaminophen-induced ALF 88%, 78%; CLD 93%, 82%: P>0.6 log rank). Two acetaminophen-induced ALF patients reattempted suicide post-LT (one died 8 years post-LT). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high prevalence of psychiatric disturbance, outcomes for patients transplanted emergently for acetaminophen-induced ALF were comparable to those transplanted for non-acetaminophen-induced ALF and electively for CLD. Multidisciplinary approaches with long-term psychiatric follow-up may contribute to low post-transplant suicide rates seen and low rates of graft loss because of non-compliance.
BACKGROUND: Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host. The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia. The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity. OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease. Two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively. The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous cidofovir for progressive disseminated disease. An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome. The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant. Intravenous ribavirin was administered on a compassionate-use protocol. RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia. The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease. Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated. Use of cidofovir in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia. DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency. Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection. Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response. CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered. The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible. Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.
BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. The serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist. In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced psychosis. METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH-induced psychosis patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients. RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH-induced psychosis patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. Moreover, this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and METH-induced psychosis patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH-induced psychosis in the Japanese population.
BACKGROUND: Although an indicator of renal tubular dysfunction, an increased urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in renal tubular cells. METHODS: Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce proteinuria. Total protein, albumin, NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days. The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three, four, six, eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero, four, eight and thirty three. RESULTS: Following intravenous PAN urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two, but returned to normal by day four. After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin, total protein excretion and NAG activity. Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards. Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four. Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak proteinuria and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets (day six onwards). CONCLUSIONS: This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity, occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells. Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage.
BACKGROUND: Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), it may also cause decreased renal function. Little information is available to predict which patients are at highest risk for this complication. OBJECTIVE: To quantify specific clinical predictors of reduction in renal function in patients with CHF who are prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. METHOD: We analyzed data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment of CHF. There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to enalapril with a median follow-up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow-up of 967 days. Decreased renal function was defined as a rise in serum creatinine >/=0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension, diabetes, and use of antiplatelet, diuretic, and beta-blocker therapy. RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33% greater likelihood of decreased renal function than controls (P =.003). By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups, but significantly more so in the enalapril group (enalapril: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with enalapril; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25). Diuretic therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of decreased renal function in the enalapril group (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.66). Conversely, enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) compared with placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) in patients with diabetes. A lower risk of renal impairment was seen in both groups with beta-blocker therapy (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85) and higher baseline ejection fraction (RR 0.93 per 5% increment, 95% CI 0.91-0. 96). CONCLUSIONS: Enalapril use caused a 33% increase in the risk of decreased renal function in patients with CHF. Diuretic use and advanced age increased this risk. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of renal impairment in all patients with CHF, but this risk was reduced in the enalapril group compared with the placebo group. beta-Blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective in all patients regardless of therapy.
BACKGROUND: Although intravitreal aminoglycosides have substantially improved visual prognosis in endophthalmitis, macular infarction may impair full visual recovery. METHODS: We present a case of presumed amikacin retinal toxicity following treatment with amikacin and vancomycin for alpha-haemolytic streptococcal endophthalmitis. RESULTS: Endophthalmitis resolved with improvement in visual acuity to 6/24 at three months. Fundus fluorescein angiography confirmed macular capillary closure and telangiectasis. CONCLUSIONS: Currently accepted intravitreal antibiotic regimens may cause retinal toxicity and macular ischaemia. Treatment strategies aimed at avoiding retinal toxicity are discussed.
BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is high among elderly patients, few data are available regarding the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in this group of patients. Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine (VNB) or gemcitabine (GEM) may obtain a response rate of 20-30% in elderly patients, with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life. In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of GEM and VNB in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with advanced NSCLC were included, 38 of whom were age >/= 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving cisplatin. All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Treatment was comprised of VNB, 25 mg/m(2), plus GEM, 1000 mg/m(2), both on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five courses were administered, with a median of 3. 6 courses per patient. The overall response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval, 15-41%). Two patients attained a complete response (4%) and 11 patients (22%) achieved a partial response. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved in 35% of those patients with an initial value > 0, whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients (55%). The median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1-year survival rate was 33%. Toxicity was mild. Six patients (12%) had World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia, 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, and 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3 neurotoxicity. Three patients with severe neutropenia (6%) died of sepsis. The median age of those patients developing Grade 3-4 neutropenia was significantly higher than that of the remaining patients (75 years vs. 72 years; P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of GEM and VNB is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age >/= 75 years. This age group had an increased risk of myelosuppression. Therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment. New chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower toxicity are needed for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.
BACKGROUND: An association between the use of oral contraceptives and the risk of myocardial infarction has been found in some, but not all, studies. We investigated this association, according to the type of progestagen included in third-generation (i.e., desogestrel or gestodene) and second-generation (i.e., levonorgestrel) oral contraceptives, the dose of estrogen, and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS: In a nationwide, population-based, case-control study, we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first myocardial infarction between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a myocardial infarction and who were matched for age, calendar year of the index event, and area of residence. Subjects supplied information on oral-contraceptive use and major cardiovascular risk factors. An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS: The odds ratio for myocardial infarction among women who used any type of combined oral contraceptive, as compared with nonusers, was 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.8). The adjusted odds ratio was 2.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 4.1) among women who used second-generation oral contraceptives and 1.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 2.5) among those who used third-generation oral contraceptives. Among women who used oral contraceptives, the odds ratio was 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.0) for those without a prothrombotic mutation and 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 5.5) for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS: The risk of myocardial infarction was increased among women who used second-generation oral contraceptives. The results with respect to the use of third-generation oral contraceptives were inconclusive but suggested that the risk was lower than the risk associated with second-generation oral contraceptives. The risk of myocardial infarction was similar among women who used oral contraceptives whether or not they had a prothrombotic mutation.
BACKGROUND: An association has been found between transplant glomerulopathy (TG) and reduplication of peritubular capillary basement membranes (PTCR). Although such an association is of practical and theoretical importance, only one prospective study has tried to confirm it. METHODS: We examined 278 consecutive renal specimens (from 135 transplants and 143 native kidneys) for ultrastructural evidence of PTCR. In addition to renal allografts with TG, we also examined grafts with acute rejection, recurrent glomerulonephritis, chronic allograft nephropathy and stable grafts ("protocol biopsies"). Native kidney specimens included a wide range of glomerulopathies as well as cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, malignant hypertension, acute interstitial nephritis, and acute tubular necrosis. RESULTS: We found PTCR in 14 of 15 cases of TG, in 7 transplant biopsy specimens without TG, and in 13 of 143 native kidney biopsy specimens. These 13 included cases of malignant hypertension, thrombotic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein nephritis, crescentic glomerulonephritis, and cocaine-related acute renal failure. Mild PTCR in allografts without TG did not predict renal failure or significant proteinuria after follow-up periods of between 3 months and 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in transplants, there is a strong association between well-developed PTCR and TG, while the significance of mild PTCR and its predictive value in the absence of TG is unclear. PTCR also occurs in certain native kidney diseases, though the association is not as strong as that for TG. We suggest that repeated endothelial injury, including immunologic injury, may be the cause of this lesion both in allografts and native kidneys.
BACKGROUND: Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suggests that a low incidence of developmental anomalies occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces developmental anomalies when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day (GD) 9, 10, or 11 (Kimmel CA, Wilson JG, Schumacher HJ. Teratology 4:15-24, 1971). There are no published ASA studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17. Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when ASA is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with ASA when a multiple dosing paradigm is used. METHODS: ASA was administered as a single dose on GD 9 (0, 250, 500, or 625 mg/kg), 10 (0, 500, 625, or 750 mg/kg), or 11 (0, 500, 750, or 1000 mg/kg) and from GD 6 to GD 17 (0, 50, 125, or 250 mg/kg a day) in the multiple dose study to SD rats. Animals were killed on GD 21, and fetuses were examined viscerally. RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and midline defects (MDs) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia (DH), MDs, and VSDs in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these malformations, even though ASA induces several other low-incidence malformations. In single dose studies, DH, MD, and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10. VSD also was noted following treatment on GD 11. In contrast, DH and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high-dose group, and VSD was noted across all dose groups. CONCLUSIONS: High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats. Variations and malformations were similar when ASA was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17). It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with ASA given at multiple doses.
BACKGROUND: Animals treated with gentamicin can show residual areas of interstitial fibrosis in the renal cortex. This study investigated the expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and macrophages in the renal cortex and structural and functional renal changes of rats treated with gentamicin or gentamicin + pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-kappaB inhibitor. METHODS: 38 female Wistar rats were injected with gentamicin, 40 mg/kg, twice a day for 9 days, 38 with gentamicin + PDTC, and 28 with 0.15 M NaCl solution. The animals were killed 5 and 30 days after these injections and the kidneys were removed for histological and immunohistochemical studies. The results of the immunohistochemical studies were scored according to the extent of staining. The fractional interstitial area was determined by morphometry. RESULTS: Gentamicin-treated rats presented a transitory increase in plasma creatinine levels. Increased ED-1, MAP kinases and NF-kappaB staining were also observed in the renal cortex from all gentamicin-treated rats compared to control (p < 0.05). The animals killed on day 30 also presented fibrosis in the renal cortex despite the recovery of renal function. Treatment with PDTC reduced the functional and structural changes induced by gentamicin. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that inhibition of NF-kappaB activation attenuates tubulointerstitial nephritis induced by gentamicin.
BACKGROUND: Atrial tachycardia-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF) and decreases L-type Ca(2+) current. There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L-type Ca(2) channel blockade can promote AF, consistent with an AF promoting effect of Ca(2+) channel inhibition. METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of AF promotion by Ca(2+) channel blockers, we administered verapamil to morphine-chloralose anesthetized dogs. Diltiazem was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with atropine and nadolol was applied in some experiments. Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during AF. RESULTS: Verapamil caused AF promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-S.E.) to 95+/-39 s (P<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s (P<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of verapamil. In these experiments, verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms (P<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity (from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1%, P<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of AF (94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms, P<0.005). Diltiazem did not affect ERP, AF cycle length or AF duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil (n=5). In the presence of autonomic blockade, verapamil failed to promote AF and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness. Neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade. Epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted AF by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil promotes AF in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry, an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem.
BACKGROUND: Azathioprine is widely used as an immunosuppressive drug. The side effects of azathioprine include anemia, which has been attributed to bone marrow suppression. Alternatively, anemia could result from accelerated suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis, which is characterized by exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) at the erythrocyte surface and by cell shrinkage. METHODS: The present experiments explored whether azathioprine influences eryptosis. According to annexin V binding, erythrocytes from patients indeed showed a significant increase of PS exposure within 1 week of treatment with azathioprine. In a second series, cytosolic Ca2+ activity (Fluo3 fluorescence), cell volume (forward scatter), and PS-exposure (annexin V binding) were determined by FACS analysis in erythrocytes from healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Exposure to azathioprine (> or =2 microg/mL) for 48 hours increased cytosolic Ca2+ activity and annexin V binding and decreased forward scatter. The effect of azathioprine on both annexin V binding and forward scatter was significantly blunted in the nominal absence of extracellular Ca2+. CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine triggers suicidal erythrocyte death, an effect presumably contributing to azathioprine-induced anemia.
BACKGROUND: Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30% to 38% of users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine had valvular disease, these drugs were withdrawn from the market. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for new or worsening valvular abnormalities among users of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Academic primary care practices. PATIENTS: 46 patients who used fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Follow-up echocardiography. The primary outcome was new or worsening valvulopathy, defined as progression of either aortic or mitral regurgitation by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U.S. Food and Drug Administration criteria (at least mild aortic regurgitation or moderate mitral regurgitation). RESULTS: Two patients (4.3% [95% CI, 0.6% to 14.8%]) receiving fenfluramine-phentermine developed valvular heart disease. One had baseline bicuspid aortic valve and mild aortic regurgitation that progressed to moderate regurgitation. The second patient developed new moderate aortic insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Users of diet medications are at risk for valvular heart disease. However, the incidence may be lower than that reported previously.
BACKGROUND: Bepridil hydrochloride (Bpd) has attracted attention as an effective drug for atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL). However, serious adverse effects, including torsade de pointes (Tdp), have been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Adverse effects of Bpd requiring discontinuation of treatment were evaluated. Bpd was administered to 459 patients (361 males, 63+/-12 years old) comprising 378 AF and 81 AFL cases. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction and atrial dimension (LAD) were 66+/-11% and 40+/-6 mm, respectively. Adverse effects were observed in 19 patients (4%) during an average follow-up of 20 months. There was marked QT prolongation greater than 0.55 s in 13 patients, bradycardia less than 40 beats/min in 6 patients, dizziness and general fatigue in 1 patient each. In 4 of 13 patients with QT prolongation, Tdp occurred. The major triggering factors of Tdp were hypokalemia and sudden decrease in heart rate. There were no differences in the clinical backgrounds of the patients with and without Tdp other than LAD and age, which were larger and older in the patients with Tdp. CONCLUSION: Careful observation of serum potassium concentration and the ECG should always be done during Bpd administration, particularly in elderly patients.
BACKGROUND: Calcitriol therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with renal failure but has several drawbacks, including hypercalcemia and/or marked suppression of bone turnover, which may lead to adynamic bone disease. A new vitamin D analogue, 22-oxacalcitriol (OCT), has been shown to have promising characteristics. This study was undertaken to determine the effects of OCT on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired renal function. METHODS: Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized (Nx, N = 38) or sham-operated (Sham, N = 22). The animals received supplemental phosphate to enhance PTH secretion. Fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation, half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of OCT (three times per week); the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks. Thereafter, the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months. Biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study, and bone biopsies were done at baseline, 60 weeks after OCT or vehicle treatment, and at the end of the crossover period. RESULTS: In Nx dogs, OCT significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency. In long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, OCT (0.03 microg/kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months. Serum PTH levels rose thereafter, but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control. These effects were accompanied by episodes of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. In animals with normal renal function, OCT induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0.1 microg/kg, which was not sustained with lowering of the doses. In Nx dogs, OCT reversed abnormal bone formation, such as woven osteoid and fibrosis, but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover. In addition, OCT improved mineralization lag time, (that is, the rate at which osteoid mineralizes) in both Nx and Sham dogs. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that even though OCT does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency, it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and, therefore, does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease.
BACKGROUND: Cardiac troponins I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial cell injury. We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model. METHODS: Thirty-five Wistar rats were given 1.5 mg/kg DOX, i.v., weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg/kg BW. Ten rats received saline as a control group. cTnI was measured with Access(R) (ng/ml) and a research immunoassay (pg/ml), and compared with cTnT, CK-MB mass and CK. By using transthoracic echocardiography, anterior and posterior wall thickness, LV diameters and LV fractional shortening (FS) were measured in all rats before DOX or saline, and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats. Histology was performed in DOX-rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last DOX dose and in all controls. RESULTS: Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9-week period. End-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) LV diameters/BW significantly increased, whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the DOX group (p<0.001). These parameters remained unchanged in controls. Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis. In 7 of the 18 rats, degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found. Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis. A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7.5 and 12 mg/kg in comparison with baseline (p<0.05). cTnT found in rats after 12 mg/kg were significantly greater than that found after 7.5 mg/kg DOX. Maximal cTnI (pg/ml) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in DOX rats compared with controls (p=0.006, 0.007). cTnI (ng/ml), CK-MB mass and CK remained unchanged in DOX rats compared with controls. All markers remained stable in controls. Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters/BW (r=0.81 and 0.65; p<0.0001). A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes, and between LV diameters/BW and histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes. Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX, probably due to heterogeneity in cross-reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms, it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments.
BACKGROUND: Cisplatin has minimal antitumor activity when used as second- or third-line treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma. Older reports suggest an objective response rate of 8% when 60-120 mg/m2 of cisplatin is administered every 3-4 weeks. Although a dose-response effect has been observed with cisplatin, the dose-limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin (e.g., nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neurotoxicity) have limited its use as a treatment for breast carcinoma. WR-2721 or amifostine initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war. Amifostine subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of alkylating agents and cisplatin without decreasing the antitumor effect of the chemotherapy. Early trials of cisplatin and amifostine also suggested that the incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neuropathy were reduced. METHODS: A Phase II study of the combination of cisplatin plus amifostine was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic breast carcinoma who had received one, but not more than one, chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. Patients received amifostine, 910 mg/m2 intravenously over 15 minutes. After completion of the amifostine infusion, cisplatin 120 mg/m2 was administered over 30 minutes. Intravenous hydration and mannitol was administered before and after cisplatin. Treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 (16%) were ineligible. A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients. Six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16%. Most patients (57%) stopped treatment because of disease progression. Neurologic toxicity was reported in 52% of patients. Seven different life-threatening toxicities were observed in patients while receiving treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cisplatin and amifostine in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16%. Neither a tumor-protective effect nor reduced toxicity to normal tissues was observed with the addition of amifostine to cisplatin in this trial.
BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic. One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity, including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single-agent cisplatin with and without mannitol. METHODS: This single-center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage. Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single-agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012. The primary outcome was acute kidney injury (AKI). RESULTS: We evaluated 143 patients who received single-agent cisplatin; 97.2% of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy. Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity: odds ratio [OR] = 2.646 (95% CI = 1.008, 6.944; P = 0.048). Patients who received the 100 mg/m(2) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity: OR = 11.494 (95% CI = 4.149, 32.258; P < 0.0001) and OR = 3.219 (95% CI = 1.228, 8.439; P = 0.017), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When limited quantities of mannitol are available, it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity. Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg/m(2) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol.
BACKGROUND: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy combinations improve quality of life and survival in advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The emergence of new active drugs might translate into more effective regimens for the treatment of this disease. METHODS: The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility, response rate, and toxicity of a paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine combination to treat metastatic NSCLC. Thirty-five consecutive chemotherapy-naive patients with Stage IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were treated with a combination of paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 3 hours) on Day 1, cisplatin (120 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 6 hours) on Day 1, and gemcitabine (800 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 30 minutes) on Days 1 and 8, every 4 weeks. Although responding patients were scheduled to receive consolidation radiotherapy and 24 patients received preplanned second-line chemotherapy after disease progression, the response and toxicity rates reported refer only to the chemotherapy regimen given. RESULTS: All the patients were examined for toxicity; 34 were examinable for response. An objective response was observed in 73.5% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.6-87.1%), including 4 complete responses (11.7%). According to intention-to-treat, the overall response rate was 71.4% (95% CI, 53. 7-85.4%). After 154 courses of therapy, the median dose intensity was 131 mg/m(2) for paclitaxel (97.3%), 117 mg/m(2) for cisplatin (97.3%), and 1378 mg/m(2) for gemcitabine (86.2%). World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 39.9% and 11.4% of patients, respectively. There was one treatment-related death. Nonhematologic toxicities were mild. After a median follow-up of 22 months, the median progression free survival rate was 7 months, and the median survival time was 16 months. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine is well tolerated and shows high activity in metastatic NSCLC. This treatment merits further comparison with other cisplatin-based regimens.
BACKGROUND: Clomiphene citrate (CC) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction. It is considered safe, with minimal side effects. Thromboembolism is a rare but life-threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with CC. Spontaneous coronary thrombosis or thromboembolism with subsequent clot lysis has been suggested as one of the most common causes of myocardial infarction (MI) during pregnancy, with a subsequently normal coronary angiogram. CASE: A 33-year-old woman with a 5-week gestation had recently received CC for ovulation induction and presented with chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed a lateral and anterior wall myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzymes showed a peak rise in troponin I to 9.10 ng/mL. An initial exercise stress test was normal. At the time of admission, the patient was at high risk of radiation injury to the fetus, so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester. It showed normal coronary vessels. CONCLUSION: This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between CC and myocardial infarction. Thrombosis might be a rare but hazardous complication of CC. Given this life-threatening complication, appropriate prophylactic measures should be used in high-risk woman undergoing ovarian stimulation.
BACKGROUND: Cocaine is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties. While the mechanisms underlying cocaine's rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine, such as anxiety. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (NE), in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine-induced anxiety. RESULTS: We found that cocaine dose-dependently increased anxiety-like behavior in control (Dbh +/-) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration. The Dbh -/- mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine. Cocaine-induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh +/- mice following administration of disulfiram, a dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor. In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine-induced anxiety-like behavior in Dbh +/- and wild-type C57BL6/J mice, while the alpha(1) antagonist prazosin and the alpha(2) antagonist yohimbine had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that noradrenergic signaling via beta-adrenergic receptors is required for cocaine-induced anxiety in mice.
BACKGROUND: Combined hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) and lamivudine in prophylaxis of the recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation has significantly improved the survival of HBsAg positive patients. This study was undertaken to evaluate the outcomes of liver transplantation for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV). METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis and a review of the organ transplant database identified 51 patients (43 men and 8 women) transplanted for benign HBV-related cirrhotic diseases between June 2002 and December 2004 who had survived more than 3 months. HBIg was administered intravenously during the first week and intramuscularly thereafter. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 14.1 months, the overall recurrence rate in the 51 patients was 3.9% (2/51). The overall patient survival was 88.3%, and 82.4% after 1 and 2 years, respectively. A daily oral dose of 100 mg lamivudine for 2 weeks before transplantation for 10 patients enabled 57.1% (4/7) and 62.5% (5/8) of HBV-DNA and HBeAg positive patients respectively to convert to be negative. Intramuscular HBIg was well tolerated in all patients. CONCLUSION: Lamivudine combined with intramuscular HBIg can effectively prevent allograft from the recurrence of HBV after liver transplantation.
BACKGROUND: Concerns about possible risks of switching to mania associated with antidepressants continue to interfere with the establishment of an optimal treatment paradigm for bipolar depression. METHOD: The response of 44 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Bech-Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale. Patients who experienced a manic or hypomanic switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age, sex, diagnosis (DSM-IV bipolar I vs. bipolar II), number of previous manic episodes, type of antidepressant therapy used (electroconvulsive therapy vs. antidepressant drugs and, more particularly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), use and type of mood stabilizers (lithium vs. anticonvulsants), and temperament of the patient, assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi-structured Affective Temperament Interview. RESULTS: Switches to hypomania or mania occurred in 27% of all patients (N = 12) (and in 24% of the subgroup of patients treated with SSRIs [8/33]); 16% (N = 7) experienced manic episodes, and 11% (N = 5) experienced hypomanic episodes. Sex, age, diagnosis (bipolar I vs. bipolar II), and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching. The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer. In contrast, mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium (15%, 4/26) than in patients not treated with lithium (44%, 8/18; p = .04). The number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching, whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching (p = .008). CONCLUSION: The frequency of mood switching associated with acute antidepressant therapy may be reduced by lithium treatment. Particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyperthymic temperament, who have a greater risk of mood switches.
BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are leading causes of death in the United States. In 2002, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommended that clinicians discuss aspirin with adults who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease. PURPOSE: To determine the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and death. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (search dates, 1 January 2001 to 28 August 2008), recent systematic reviews, reference lists of retrieved articles, and suggestions from experts. STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); case-control studies; meta-analyses; and systematic reviews of aspirin versus control for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were selected to answer the following questions: Does aspirin decrease coronary heart events, strokes, death from coronary heart events or stroke, or all-cause mortality in adults without known CVD? Does aspirin increase gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic strokes? DATA EXTRACTION: All studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: New evidence from 1 good-quality RCT, 1 good-quality meta-analysis, and 2 fair-quality subanalyses of RCTs demonstrates that aspirin use reduces the number of CVD events in patients without known CVD. Men in these studies experienced fewer myocardial infarctions and women experienced fewer ischemic strokes. Aspirin does not seem to affect CVD mortality or all-cause mortality in either men or women. The use of aspirin for primary prevention increases the risk for major bleeding events, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding events, in both men and women. Men have an increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes with aspirin use. A new RCT and meta-analysis suggest that the risk for hemorrhagic strokes in women is not statistically significantly increased. LIMITATIONS: New evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is limited. The dose of aspirin used in the RCTs varied, which prevented the estimation of the most appropriate dose for primary prevention. Several of the RCTs were conducted within populations of health professionals, which potentially limits generalizability. CONCLUSION: Aspirin reduces the risk for myocardial infarction in men and strokes in women. Aspirin use increases the risk for serious bleeding events.
BACKGROUND: Current animal models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) typically involve acute, drug-induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stereotypies or anxiety. None of these current models demonstrate multiple OCD-like behaviors. METHODS: Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood. RESULTS: Clomipramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety (elevated plus maze and marble burying), behavioral inflexibility (perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning), working memory impairment (e.g., win-shift paradigm), hoarding, and corticostriatal dysfunction. Dopamine D2 receptors were elevated in the striatum, whereas serotonin 2C, but not serotonin 1A, receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an OCD-like profile in animals. Moreover, these behaviors are accompanied by biochemical changes in brain regions previously identified as relevant to OCD. This novel model of OCD demonstrates that drug exposure during a sensitive period can program disease-like systems permanently, which could have implications for current and future therapeutic strategies for this and other psychiatric disorders.
BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are one of the most often ingested drugs during pregnancy. Unlike general toxicity data, their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non-selective (piroxicam) and selective (DFU; 5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl) phenyl-2(5H)-furanon) COX-2 inhibitors. METHODS: Drugs were separately, orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 (GD1=plug day). Doses were set at 0.3, 3.0 and 30.0mg/kg for piroxicam and 0.2, 2.0 and 20.0mg/kg for DFU. Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined. Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done. The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal (VSD) and midline (MD) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam, selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitor based on present and historic data. RESULTS: Maternal toxicity, intrauterine growth retardation, and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam. Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose. Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU-exposed groups. Prenatal exposure to non-selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX-2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Both selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose. Unlike DFU, piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams. Prenatal exposure to selective COX-2 inhibitors does not increase the risk of ventricular septal and midline defects in rat when compared to non-selective drugs and historic control.
BACKGROUND: Cyproterone acetate combined with ethinyl estradiol (CPA/EE) is licensed in the UK for the treatment of women with acne and hirsutism and is also a treatment option for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with CPA/EE compared with conventional combined oral contraceptives (COCs). We believe the results of those studies may have been affected by residual confounding. METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case-control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with acne, hirsutism or PCOS to estimate the risk of VTE associated with CPA/EE. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for CPA/EE versus conventional COCs was 2.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-3.58]. Using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception, had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms, the case-control analysis gave an adjusted odds ratio (OR(adj)) of 7.44 (95% CI 3.67-15.08) for CPA/EE use compared with an OR(adj) of 2.58 (95% CI 1.60-4.18) for use of conventional COCs. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated an increased risk of VTE associated with the use of CPA/EE in women with acne, hirsutism or PCOS although residual confounding by indication cannot be excluded.
BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and myocarditis occur in many HIV-infected individuals, resulting in symptomatic heart failure in up to 5% of patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but has resulted in an increase in cardiac and skeletal myopathies. METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to investigate whether the HAART component zidovudine (3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine; AZT) triggers the Fas-dependent cell-death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of DCM, 8-week-old transgenic (expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non-transgenic (NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of AZT (0, 0.07, 0.2, and 0.7 mg/ml). After 6 weeks, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods. NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function. In contrast, AZT-treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles. These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL, as well as increased activation of caspase 3, translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere, and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis. These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization, as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium, as identified in HIV-positive patients, might increase the susceptibility to HAART-induced cardiomyopathy due to activation of apoptotic pathways, resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction.
BACKGROUND: Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) provide an alternative method of anticoagulation for patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or HIT with thrombosis (HITT) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In the following report, a 65-year-old critically ill patient with a suspected history of HITT was administered argatroban for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation. The patient required massive transfusion support (55 units of red blood cells, 42 units of fresh-frozen plasma, 40 units of cryoprecipitate, 40 units of platelets, and three doses of recombinant Factor VIIa) for severe intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma samples from before and after CPB were analyzed postoperatively for argatroban concentration using a modified ecarin clotting time (ECT) assay. RESULTS: Unexpectedly high concentrations of argatroban were measured in these samples (range, 0-32 microg/mL), and a prolonged plasma argatroban half life (t(1/2)) of 514 minutes was observed (published elimination t(1/2) is 39-51 minutes [< or = 181 minutes with hepatic impairment]). CONCLUSIONS: Correlation of plasma argatroban concentration versus the patient's coagulation variables and clinical course suggest that prolonged elevated levels of plasma argatroban may have contributed to the patient's extended coagulopathy. Because DTIs do not have reversal agents, surgical teams and transfusion services should remain aware of the possibility of massive transfusion events during anticoagulation with these agents. This is the first report to measure plasma argatroban concentration in the context of CPB and extended coagulopathy.
BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin induces a self-perpetuating nephropathy characterized by early glomerular and late-onset tubular lesions in rats. We investigated the potential role of mitochondrial injury in the onset of these lesions. METHODS: Rats were treated with intravenous doxorubicin (1 mg kg(-1) week(-1)) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week ('short-term') or 30 weeks ('long-term') following the last dose. Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia. All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age. Glomerular and tubular injury was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components. Finally, we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as well as superoxide production and the 4834 base pair 'common' mtDNA deletion. RESULTS: The 'long-term' group had significant glomerular and tubular lesions, depressed activities of mtDNA-encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) and increased citrate synthase activity. In addition, expression of the mtDNA-encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased. In 'short-term' rats, there were fewer tubular lesions, but similar numbers of glomerular lesions activity. Among all animals, glomerular and tubular injury were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels, mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain subunit COX-I. Injury was positively correlated with superoxide production and the activities of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes. Kidneys from the 'long-term' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in 'short-term' animals and these were not observed in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain function and induction of superoxide in doxorubicin-induced renal lesions.
BACKGROUND: Drug-induced long QT syndrome is a serious adverse drug reaction. Methadone prolongs the QT interval in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. In the inpatient setting, the frequency of QT interval prolongation with methadone treatment, its dose dependence, and the importance of cofactors such as drug-drug interactions remain unknown. METHODS: We performed a systematic, retrospective study comparing active or former intravenous drug users receiving methadone and those not receiving methadone among all patients hospitalized over a 5-year period in a tertiary care hospital. A total of 167 patients receiving methadone fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were compared with a control group of 80 injection drug users not receiving methadone. In addition to methadone dose, 15 demographic, biological, and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for QT prolongation. RESULTS: Among 167 methadone maintenance patients, the prevalence of QTc prolongation to 0.50 second((1/2)) or longer was 16.2% compared with 0% in 80 control subjects. Six patients (3.6%) in the methadone group presented torsades de pointes. QTc length was weakly but significantly associated with methadone daily dose (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 0.20; P<.01). Multivariate regression analysis allowed attribution of 31.8% of QTc variability to methadone dose, cytochrome P-450 3A4 drug-drug interactions, hypokalemia, and altered liver function. CONCLUSIONS: QT interval prolongation in methadone maintenance patients hospitalized in a tertiary care center is a frequent finding. Methadone dose, presence of cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors, potassium level, and liver function contribute to QT prolongation. Long QT syndrome can occur with low doses of methadone.
BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index (dP/dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12-lead ECG, for detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, using Tc99m-Sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia. METHODS: The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi-SPECT/dobutamine stress test. Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP/dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level. In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT. The increase in dP/dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non-ischemic group. dP/dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone. RESULTS: The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%. CONCLUSIONS: If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP/dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost-savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, especially in patients unable to exercise.
BACKGROUND: Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers. Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however. Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre-existing contralateral paralysis. We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences. METHODS: This prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. Vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy. Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting (ropivacaine) and short-acting (prilocaine) anesthetic. RESULTS: All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively. Twelve patients (43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis. It resolved in all cases < or =24 hours. There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without. CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients. Because pre-existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency (up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis. In patients with preoperative contralateral vocal cord paralysis, surgery under general anesthesia should be considered.
BACKGROUND: Familial partial lipodystrophy (Dunnigan) type 3 (FPLD3, Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] 604367) results from heterozygous mutations in PPARG encoding peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. Both dominant-negative and haploinsufficiency mechanisms have been suggested for this condition. METHODS: We present a Canadian FPLD3 kindred with an affected mother who had loss of fat on arms and legs, but no increase in facial, neck, suprascapular or abdominal fat. She had profound insulin resistance, diabetes, severe hypertriglyceridemia and relapsing pancreatitis, while her pre-pubescent daughter had normal fat distribution but elevated plasma triglycerides and C-peptide and depressed high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. RESULTS: The mother and daughter were each heterozygous for PPARG nonsense mutation Y355X, whose protein product in vitro was transcriptionally inactive with no dominant-negative activity against the wild-type receptor. In addition the mutant protein appeared to be markedly unstable. CONCLUSION: Taken together with previous studies of human PPARG mutations, these findings suggest that PPAR-gamma deficiency due either to haploinsufficiency or to substantial activity loss due to dominant negative interference of the normal allele product's function can each contribute to the FPLD3 phenotype.
BACKGROUND: Fibrin sealants (FS) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery. In order to increase clot stability, FS typically contain aprotinin, a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor. Recently, synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid (tAMCA) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin. However, tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures. We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS. METHOD: FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA (0.5-47.5 mg/ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats. The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia. FINDINGS: FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours. The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA. Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg/ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats. In contrast, FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity. INTERPRETATION: Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS. Thus, use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient.
BACKGROUND: Focal subtenon carboplatin injections have recently been used as a presumably toxicity-free adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma. OBJECTIVE: To report our clinical experience with abnormal ocular motility in patients treated with subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy. METHODS: We noted abnormal ocular motility in 10 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma who had received subtenon carboplatin. During ocular manipulation under general anesthesia, we assessed their eyes by forced duction testing, comparing ocular motility after tumor control with ocular motility at diagnosis. Eyes subsequently enucleated because of treatment failure (n = 4) were examined histologically. RESULTS: Limitation of ocular motility was detected in all 12 eyes of 10 patients treated for intraocular retinoblastoma with 1 to 6 injections of subtenon carboplatin as part of multimodality therapy. Histopathological examination revealed many lipophages in the periorbital fat surrounding the optic nerve in 1 eye, indicative of phagocytosis of previously existing fat cells and suggesting prior fat necrosis. The enucleations were technically difficult and hazardous for globe rupture because of extensive orbital soft tissue adhesions. CONCLUSIONS: Subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy is associated with significant fibrosis of orbital soft tissues, leading to mechanical restriction of eye movements and making subsequent enucleation difficult. Subtenon carboplatin is not free of toxicity, and its use is best restricted to specific indications.
BACKGROUND: Four studies published since December, 1995, reported that the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was higher in women who used oral contraceptives (OCs) containing the third-generation progestagens gestodene or desogestrel than in users of OCs containing second-generation progestagens. However, confounding and bias in the design of these studies may have affected the findings. The aim of our study was to re-examine the association between risk of VTE and OC use with a different study design and analysis to avoid some of the bias and confounding of the earlier studies. METHODS: We used computer records of patients from 143 general practices in the UK. The study was based on the medical records of about 540,000 women born between 1941 and 1981. All women who had a recorded diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis, venous thrombosis not otherwise specified, or pulmonary embolus during the study period, and who had been treated with an anticoagulant were identified as potential cases of VTE. We did a cohort analysis to estimate and compare incidence of VTE in users of the main OC preparations, and a nested case-control study to calculate the odds ratios of VTE associated with use of different types of OC, after adjustment for potential confounding factors. In the case-control study, we matched cases to controls by exact year of birth, practice, and current use of OCs. We used a multiple logistic regression model that included body-mass index, number of cycles, change in type of OC prescribed within 3 months of the event, previous pregnancy, and concurrent disease. FINDINGS: 85 women met the inclusion criteria for VTE, two of whom were users of progestagen-only OCs. Of the 83 cases of VTE associated with use of combined OCs, 43 were recorded as deep-vein thrombosis, 35 as pulmonary thrombosis, and five as venous thrombosis not otherwise specified. The crude rate of VTE per 10,000 woman-years was 4.10 in current users of any OC, 3.10 in users of second-generation OCs, and 4.96 in users of third-generation preparations. After adjustment for age, the rate ratio of VTE in users of third-generation relative to second-generation OCs was 1.68 (95% CI 1.04-2.75). Logistic regression showed no significant difference in the risk of VTE between users of third-generation and second-generation OCs. Among users of third-generation progestagens, the risk of VTE was higher in users of desogestrel with 20 g ethinyloestradiol than in users of gestodene or desogestrel with 30 g ethinyloestradiol. With all second-generation OCs as the reference, the odds ratios for VTE were 3.49 (1.21-10.12) for desogestrel plus 20 g ethinyloestradiol and 1.18 (0.66-2.17) for the other third-generation progestagens. INTERPRETATION: The previously reported increase in odds ratio associated with third-generation OCs when compared with second-generation products is likely to have been the result of residual confounding by age. The increased odds ratio associated with products containing 20 micrograms ethinyloestradiol and desogestrel compared with the 30 micrograms product is biologically implausible, and is likely to be the result of preferential prescribing and, thus, confounding.
BACKGROUND: Fumarate hydratase (HGNC approved gene symbol - FH), also known as fumarase, is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, involved in fundamental cellular energy production. First described by Zinn et al in 1986, deficiency of FH results in early onset, severe encephalopathy. In 2002, the Multiple Leiomyoma Consortium identified heterozygous germline mutations of FH in patients with multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, (MCUL: OMIM 150800). In some families renal cell cancer also forms a component of the complex and as such has been described as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC: OMIM 605839). The identification of FH as a tumor suppressor was an unexpected finding and following the identification of subunits of succinate dehydrogenase in 2000 and 2001, was only the second description of the involvement of an enzyme of intermediary metabolism in tumorigenesis. DESCRIPTION: The FH mutation database is a part of the TCA cycle gene mutation database (formerly the succinate dehydrogenase gene mutation database) and is based on the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) system. The variants included in the database were derived from the published literature and annotated to conform to current mutation nomenclature. The FH database applies HGVS nomenclature guidelines, and will assist researchers in applying these guidelines when directly submitting new sequence variants online. Since the first molecular characterization of an FH mutation by Bourgeron et al in 1994, a series of reports of both FH deficiency patients and patients with MCUL/HLRRC have described 107 variants, of which 93 are thought to be pathogenic. The most common type of mutation is missense (57%), followed by frameshifts & nonsense (27%), and diverse deletions, insertions and duplications. Here we introduce an online database detailing all reported FH sequence variants. CONCLUSION: The FH mutation database strives to systematically unify all current genetic knowledge of FH variants. We believe that this knowledge will assist clinical geneticists and treating physicians when advising patients and their families, will provide a rapid and convenient resource for research scientists, and may eventually assist in gaining novel insights into FH and its related clinical syndromes.
BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood. With current treatment regimens including combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year. Therefore, patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen. Generally, carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin, whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known. However, we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin, which is infrequently reported. CASE: A 58-year-old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe. He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection. Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen. RESULTS: He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection. Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished, inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks. Finally, 6 weeks later, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost. CONCLUSION: When performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin, we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity. It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects.
BACKGROUND: Hallucinations as a symptom of central neurotoxicity are a known but poorly described side effect of ifosfamide. Most cases of ifosfamide-induced hallucinations have been reported with other mental status changes. METHODS: The authors interviewed six persons with ifosfamide-induced hallucinations in the presence of a clear sensorium. All patients were receiving high-dose ifosfamide as part of their bone marrow transplant procedure. RESULTS: Hallucinations occurred only when the patient's eyes were closed and, in all but one case, were reported as disturbing or frightening. Underreporting of these hallucinations by patients is likely. CONCLUSIONS: Hallucinations may be the sole or first manifestation of neurotoxicity. The incidence may be dose and infusion-time related. The clinician should be alerted for possible ifosfamide-induced hallucinations, which may occur without other signs of neurotoxicity. "Eyes-closed" hallucinatory experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation. Patients anxious about this experience respond well to support and education about this occurrence. Optimal pharmacologic management of disturbed patients is unclear. If agitation becomes marked, high-potency neuroleptics (i.e., haloperidol) may be effective.
BACKGROUND: Hemolytic anemia is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin. Because of ribavirin-related hemolytic anemia, dose reduction is a common event in this therapy. In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy. METHODS: Thirty-seven of 160 patients who had HCV-genotype 1b, had high virus load, and received 24-week combination therapy developed anemia with hemoglobin level <10 g/dl or anemia-related signs during therapy. After that, these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of ribavirin (200 mg) per day. After reduction of ribavirin, 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks (group A). However, 10 of 37 patients with reduction of ribavirin could not continue combination therapy because their <8.5 g/dl hemoglobin values decreased to or anemia-related severe side effects occurred (group B). We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of ribavirin in groups A and B. RESULTS: A sustained virological response (SVR) was 29.6% (8/27) in group A and 10% (1/10) in group B, respectively. A 34.4% (12/27) of SVR + biological response in group A was higher than 10% (1/10) in group B ( P = 0.051), with slight significance. With respect to hemoglobin level at the time of ribavirin reduction, a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with > or =10 g/dl hemoglobin was higher than that in patients with <10 g/dl ( P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of ribavirin at hemoglobin level > or =10 g/dl is suitable in terms of efficacy and side effects.
BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia presents 5 to 12 days after heparin exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli. Delayed recognition and treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia contribute to poor patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are delayed. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Three large urban hospitals (with active cardiovascular surgery programs). PATIENTS: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom heparin-induced thrombocytopenia became apparent on delayed presentation with thromboembolic complications. MEASUREMENTS: Platelet counts, onset of objectively determined thromboembolism, results of heparin-induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests, and outcomes. RESULTS: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included heparin exposure--in most cases, with no thrombocytopenia recognized--only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with thromboembolic complications. Thromboemboli were venous (12 patients, 7 with pulmonary emboli) or arterial (4 patients) or both. Platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation. On readmission, 11 patients received therapeutic heparin, which worsened the patients' clinical condition and, in all 11 cases, decreased the platelet count (mean at readmission, 143 x 10(9) cells/L; mean nadir after heparin re-exposure, 39 x 10(9) cells/L). Results of serologic tests for heparin-induced antibodies were positive in all patients. Subsequent treatments included alternative anticoagulants (11 patients), thrombolytic drugs (3 patients), inferior vena cava filters (3 patients) and, eventually, warfarin (11 patients). Three patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is increasingly being recognized. To avoid disastrous outcomes, physicians must consider heparin-induced thrombocytopenia whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with thromboembolism; therapy with alternative anticoagulants, not heparin, should be initiated.
BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, cognition, fractures and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases to November 2007: Trials Register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts. Also relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. HT included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen trials involving 41,904 women were included. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after three years), breast cancer and gallbladder disease. Long-term oestrogen-only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism, stroke and gallbladder disease (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and (for combined HT) colon cancer, with long-term use. Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia. Among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism.One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo-embolism in women taking combined continuous HT: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. However, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.
BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms. It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, heart disease, venous thromboembolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gallbladder disease, cognitive function, dementia, fractures and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases up to November 2004: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts. Relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT (oestrogens with or without progestogens) versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Fifteen RCTs were included. Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently. They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis for most outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after 3 years), breast cancer (after 5 years) and gallbladder disease. Long-term oestrogen-only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease. Overall, the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long-term use. Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia. Among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism. No trials focussed specifically on younger women. However, one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year-old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT; their absolute risk remained very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.
BACKGROUND: Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are used increasingly in industry as substitutes for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Limited studies in animals indicate potential hepatotoxicity of some of these compounds. We investigated an epidemic of liver disease in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (HCFC 123) and 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124). All nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees. Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as 1-bromo-1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (halothane) to form reactive trifluoroacetyl halide intermediates, which have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of halothane. We aimed to test whether HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver disease. METHODS: For one severely affected worker liver biopsy and immunohistochemical stainings for the presence of trifluoroacetyl protein adducts were done. The serum of six affected workers and five controls was tested for autoantibodies that react with human liver cytochrome-P450 2E1 (P450 2E1) and P58 protein disulphide isomerase isoform (P58). FINDINGS: The liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular necrosis which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas (bridging necrosis). Trifluoroacetyl-adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes. Autoantibodies against P450 2E1 or P58, previously associated with halothane hepatitis, were detected in the serum of five affected workers. INTERPRETATION: Repeated exposure of human beings to HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver injury in a large proportion of the exposed population. Although the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity of these agents is not known, the results suggest that trifluoroacetyl-altered liver proteins are involved. In view of the potentially widespread use of these compounds, there is an urgent need to develop safer alternatives.
BACKGROUND: Hypotension and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of cognitive dysfunction. We tested the hypothesis that nimodipine (NIMO) administered at the onset of nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced hypotension would preserve long-term associative memory. METHODS: The passive avoidance (PA) paradigm was used to assess memory retention. For PA training, latencies (seconds) were recorded for entry from a suspended platform into a Plexiglas tube where a shock was automatically delivered. Latencies were recorded 48 h later for a testing trial. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) NTG immediately after learning, 3) NTG 3 h after learning, 4) NTG and NIMO, 5) vehicle, and 6) NIMO alone. The extent of hypotension and changes in brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO(2)) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals. RESULTS: All groups exhibited similar training latencies (17.0 +/- 4.6 s). Mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, NTG + NIMO, or delayed NTG (580 +/- 81 s, 557 +/- 67 s, and 493 +/- 146 s, respectively). A Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the 4 treatment groups (H = 15.34; P < 0.001). In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of NTG (n = 3) and NTG + NIMO (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with NIMO alone decreased from 88.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg to 80.0 +/- 2.9 mm Hg. The intergroup difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). PbtO(2) decreased from 51.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg sem to 33.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg sem in the NTG group and from 38.6 +/- 6.1 mm Hg sem to 25.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg sem in the NTG + NIMO groups, respectively. There were no significant differences among groups. CONCLUSION: In a PA retention paradigm, the injection of NTG immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long-term associative memory in mice, whereas delayed induced hypotension had no effect. NIMO attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long-term memory caused by NTG but did not improve latency in the absence of hypotension. The observed effect of NIMO may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during hypotension, because there were no differences in the PbtO(2) indices among groups.
BACKGROUND: Hypotension is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Recent data suggest that tricyclic antidepressants inhibit calcium influx in some tissues. This study addressed the potential role of calcium channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension. METHODS: Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with calcium channel blocker overdose. CaCl2 and 4-aminopyridine. Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP to produce hypotension, QRS prolongation, and bradycardia. Fifteen min later, animals received CaCl2, NaHCO3, or saline. In a second experiment, rats received tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP followed in 15 min by 4-aminopyridine or saline. RESULTS: NaHCO3 briefly (5 min) reversed hypotension and QRS prolongation. CaCl2 and 4-aminopyridine failed to improve blood pressure. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias (p = 0.004) and seizures (p = 0.03) in the CaCl2 group was higher than the other groups. CONCLUSION: The administration of CaCl2 or 4-aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension in rats. CaCl2 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity. These findings do not support a role for calcium channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension.
BACKGROUND: Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent useful in the treatment of a wide range of cancers including sarcomas, lymphoma, gynecologic and testicular cancers. Encephalopathy has been reported in 10-40% of patients receiving high-dose IV ifosfamide. OBJECTIVE: To highlight the role of electroencephalogram (EEG) in the early detection and management of ifosfamide related encephalopathy. METHODS: Retrospective chart review including clinical data and EEG recordings was done on five patients, admitted to MD Anderson Cancer Center between years 2009 and 2012, who developed ifosfamide related acute encephalopathy. RESULTS: All five patients experienced symptoms of encephalopathy soon after (within 12 h-2 days) receiving ifosfamide. Two patients developed generalized convulsions while one patient developed continuous non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) that required ICU admission and intubation. Initial EEG showed epileptiform discharges in three patients; run of triphasic waves in one patient and moderate degree diffuse generalized slowing. Mixed pattern with the presence of both sharps and triphasic waves were also noted. Repeat EEGs within 24_h of symptom onset showed marked improvement that was correlated with clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of ifosfamide related encephalopathy correlates with EEG changes. We suggest a timely EEG evaluation for patients receiving ifosfamide who develop features of encephalopathy.
BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative convulsive seizures from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures. These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose tranexamic acid (TXA) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage. The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between TXA usage and seizures after cardiac surgery. METHODS: An in-depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients, and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury, but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients. All patients with seizures did not have permanent neurological abnormalities. All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of TXA intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg, had a mean age of 69.9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures. All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass. No evidence of brain ischemic, metabolic, or hyperthermia-induced causes for their seizures was apparent. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that use of high-dose TXA in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical seizures in susceptible patients.
BACKGROUND: In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites, long-acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation. In the present study, we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and cyclooxygenase (COX) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects. METHODS: Subjects (n = 114) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2% lidocaine or 0.5% bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h. Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery. After extraction, a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) measurements. RESULTS: The bupivacaine/rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain, as assessed by a visual analog scale, compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h. However, the bupivacaine/placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups. Moreover, bupivacaine significantly increased COX-2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine/placebo group. Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments, indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX-2, but not COX-1. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX-2 gene expression after tissue injury, which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates.
BACKGROUND: In dogs, a large amount of intravenous cocaine causes a profound deterioration of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and an increase in LV end-diastolic pressure. This study was done to assess the influence of a high intracoronary cocaine concentration on LV systolic and diastolic function in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 20 patients (14 men and 6 women aged 39 to 72 years) referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of chest pain, we measured heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, LV pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), and LV volumes and ejection fraction before and during the final 2 to 3 minutes of a 15-minute intracoronary infusion of saline (n=10, control subjects) or cocaine hydrochloride 1 mg/min (n=10). No variable changed with saline. With cocaine, the drug concentration in blood obtained from the coronary sinus was 3.0+/-0.4 (mean+/-SD) mg/L, similar in magnitude to the blood cocaine concentration reported in abusers dying of cocaine intoxication. Cocaine induced no significant change in heart rate, LV dP/dt (positive or negative), or LV end-diastolic volume, but it caused an increase in systolic and mean arterial pressures, LV end-diastolic pressure, and LV end-systolic volume, as well as a decrease in LV ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: In humans, the intracoronary infusion of cocaine sufficient in amount to achieve a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood causes a deterioration of LV systolic and diastolic performance.
BACKGROUND: In light of the recent octuplet birth and the accompanying intensive media coverage, there has been much attention on high order multiple births resulting from assisted reproductive technology. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this commentary is to review 1) the relative contribution of ART to high order multiple gestation and its impact on infant morbidity, mortality, and health care dollar loss; 2) American Society of Reproductive Medicine's guidelines for the number of embryos transferred in ART; and 3) how reproductive endocrinologists can lessen their exposure to litigation by following the ASRM guidelines for the number of embryos transferred and documenting proper informed consent in the medical records. RECOMMENDATIONS: In situations in which the number of embryos transferred is in excess of the ASRM guidelines, justification for deviating from the ASRM guidelines should be justifiable and documented in the medical records.
BACKGROUND: In man, differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, related to ACE (I/D) genotype, are associated with renal prognosis. This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage. Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats. METHODS: Renal ACE activity (Hip-His-Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats. After 1 week of recovery, proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested. RESULTS: As anticipated, adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria, renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis. Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05). Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis (r = 0.22, NS). In controls, no predictive values for renal parameters were observed. CONCLUSION: Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin-induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain. This supports the assumption that differences in renal ACE activity predispose to a less favourable course of renal damage.
BACKGROUND: In recent studies increased amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and apoptosis have been implicated in various pathological conditions in the kidney. We have studied the role of NO and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of adriamycin (ADR). METHODS: The alteration in the NO pathway was assessed by measuring nitrite levels in serum/urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPRK) system. Rats were stratified into control groups and ADR-induced nephropathy groups. These two groups were then divided into: group 1, animals receiving saline; and group 2, animals receiving aminoguanidine (AG) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible-NO synthase. On day 21, rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis. RESULTS: Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with ADR revealed focal areas of mesangial proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial inflammation. They also had significantly higher levels of proteinuria compared with control and treatment groups (P < 0.05). Urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the ADR-nephropathy group (P < 0.05). In the IPRK phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the ADR-nephropathy group. Apoptosis was not detected in controls. However, in the ADR-nephropathy group, numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas. Double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ED1, a marker for monocytes/macrophages. Treatment with AG prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine nitrite levels and apoptosis to control levels. CONCLUSION: We suggest that interactions between NO and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the ADR-induced nephrosis.
BACKGROUND: In this retrospective comparative study, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of fentanyl, midazolam, and a combination of fentanyl and midazolam to prevent etomidate-induced myoclonus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was performed based on anesthesia records. Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with etomidate, the patients were separated into 4 groups: no pretreatment (Group NP), fentanyl 1 ug.kg-1 (Group F), midazolam 0.03 mg.kg-1 (Group M), and midazolam 0.015 mg.kg-1 + fentanyl 0.5 ug.kg-1 (Group FM). Patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected: 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs, anesthesia is induced with 0.3 mg.kg-1 etomidate injected intravenously over a period of 20-30 seconds. Myoclonic movements are evaluated, which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after etomidate injection. The severity of pain due to etomidate injection, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and adverse effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: Study results showed that myoclonus incidence was 85%, 40%, 70%, and 25% in Group NP, Group F, Group M, and Group FM, respectively, and were significantly lower in Group F and Group FM. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that pretreatment with fentanyl or combination of fentanyl and midazolam was effective in preventing etomidate-induced myoclonus.
BACKGROUND: Incidence and risk factors for delirium during clozapine treatment require further clarification. METHODS: We used computerized pharmacy records to identify all adult psychiatric inpatients treated with clozapine (1995-96), reviewed their medical records to score incidence and severity of delirium, and tested associations with potential risk factors. RESULTS: Subjects (n = 139) were 72 women and 67 men, aged 40.8 +/- 12.1 years, hospitalized for 24.9 +/- 23.3 days, and given clozapine, gradually increased to an average daily dose of 282 +/- 203 mg (3.45 +/- 2.45 mg/kg) for 18.9 +/- 16.4 days. Delirium was diagnosed in 14 (10.1 % incidence, or 1.48 cases/person-years of exposure); 71.4 % of cases were moderate or severe. Associated factors were co-treatment with other centrally antimuscarinic agents, poor clinical outcome, older age, and longer hospitalization (by 17.5 days, increasing cost); sex, diagnosis or medical co-morbidity, and daily clozapine dose, which fell with age, were unrelated. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium was found in 10 % of clozapine-treated inpatients, particularly in older patients exposed to other central anticholinergics. Delirium was inconsistently recognized clinically in milder cases and was associated with increased length-of-stay and higher costs, and inferior clinical outcome.
BACKGROUND: Increased attention has been focused recently on the estrogenic effects of tamoxifen. Review of the literature reveals an association between tamoxifen use and gynecologic tumors. CASE: A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman was treated with tamoxifen for stage II estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinoma. Her aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels increase markedly after 6 months of tamoxifen use. After an additional 17 months of elevated serum transaminases, the patient was found to have a stage Ic granulosa cell tumor of the ovary. CONCLUSION: Patients with tamoxifen-induced liver dysfunction may be at increased risk for granulosa cell tumors because of alterations in tamoxifen metabolism.
BACKGROUND: Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure. Activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-/-). Alpha2ABC-/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine; however, clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC-/- mice by up to 150 bpm. Clonidine-induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice was 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of the effect in wild-type mice. A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC-knockout and wild-type mice. Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current (I(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I(f)-generating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells. As a consequence of blocking I(f), clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene-targeted mice in vivo, and thus, clonidine-like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors.
BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common cause of abdominal pain and discomfort and may be related to disordered gastrointestinal motility. Our aim was to assess the effects of long-term treatment with a prokinetic agent, cisapride, on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IBS (constipation-predominant, n = 17; diarrhoea-predominant, n = 21) underwent 24-h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week's treatment [cisapride, 5 mg three times daily (n = 19) or placebo (n = 19)]. RESULTS: In diarrhoea-predominant patients significant differences in contraction characteristics were observed between the cisapride and placebo groups. In cisapride-treated diarrhoea-predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher (29.3 +/- 3.2 versus 24.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 25.7 +/- 6.0 mm Hg), the mean contraction duration longer (3.4 +/- 0.2 versus 3.0 +/- 0.2 sec, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 3.1 +/- 0.5 sec), and the mean contraction frequency lower (2.0 +/- 0.2 versus 2.5 +/- 0.4 cont./min, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 2.5 +/- 1.1 cont./min] than patients treated with placebo. No significant differences in jejunal motility were found in the constipation-predominant IBS group. Symptoms were assessed by using a visual analogue scale before and after treatment. Symptom scores relating to the severity of constipation were lower in cisapride-treated constipation-predominant IBS patients [score, 54 +/- 5 versus 67 +/- 14 mm, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 62 +/- 19 mm]. Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients had a higher pain score after cisapride therapy [score, 55 +/- 15 versus 34 +/- 12 mm, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 67 +/- 19 mm]. CONCLUSION: Cisapride affects jejunal contraction characteristics and some symptoms in IBS.
BACKGROUND: It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of bupropion-induced seizures. This is important, since different controlled release formulations of bupropion release the active drug at different rates. METHODS: We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg, a known convulsive dose 50 (CD50), on the incidence and severity of bupropion-induced convulsions in the Swiss albino mice. A total of 69 mice, approximately 7 weeks of age, and weighing 21.0 to 29.1 g were randomly assigned to bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg treatment by intraperitoneal (IP) administration in 7 groups (9 to 10 animals per group). Bupropion HCl was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min. The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the convulsions or absence of convulsions were recorded. RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg by bolus injection induced convulsions in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1. Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the IP infusion time of bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of convulsions at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection. Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of convulsions to 99.8% reduction at 240 min. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and convulsive dose of bupropion and the risk of convulsions in a prospective study is novel.
BACKGROUND: Lamivudine is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients. Recent studies show that the YMDD motif mutants (resistant hepatitis B virus) occur as natural genome variability in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients. In this study we aimed to determine the rate of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients in Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 77 chronic hepatitis B patients who had not been treated with lamivudine were included in the study. Serum samples from patients were tested by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for detection of YMDD motif mutants. All patients were also tested for liver enzymes, anti-HCV, HBeAg, and anti-HBe. RESULTS: Of the 77 patients enrolled in the study, 73% were male and 27% were female. Mean ALT and AST levels were 124.4+/-73.4 and 103.1+/-81 IU/l, respectively. HBeAg was positive in 40% and anti-HBe in 60% of the patients. Anti-HCV was negative in all of them. YMDD motif mutants were not detected in any of the patients despite the liver enzyme levels and the presence of HBeAg or anti-HBe. CONCLUSION: Although the natural occurrence of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated patients with chronic hepatitis B has been reported, these mutants were not detected in Iranian lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients.
BACKGROUND: Lithium remains a first-line treatment for the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of lithium, such as polyuria and tremor, more subtle lithium side effects such as cognitive deficits, loss of creativity, and functional impairments remain understudied. This report summarizes our experience in switching bipolar patients from lithium to divalproex sodium to alleviate such cognitive and functional impairments. METHOD: Open, case series design. RESULTS: We report seven cases where substitution of lithium, either fully or partially, with divalproex sodium was extremely helpful in reducing the cognitive, motivational, or creative deficits attributed to lithium in our bipolar patients. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary report, divalproex sodium was a superior alternative to lithium in bipolar patients experiencing cognitive deficits, loss of creativity, and functional impairments.
BACKGROUND: Little is known about the possible role that smoking crack cocaine has on the incidence of HIV infection. Given the increasing use of crack cocaine, we sought to examine whether use of this illicit drug has become a risk factor for HIV infection. METHODS: We included data from people participating in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study who reported injecting illicit drugs at least once in the month before enrolment, lived in the greater Vancouver area, were HIV-negative at enrolment and completed at least 1 follow-up study visit. To determine whether the risk of HIV seroconversion among daily smokers of crack cocaine changed over time, we used Cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods: May 1, 1996-Nov. 30, 1999 (period 1), Dec. 1, 1999-Nov. 30, 2002 (period 2), and Dec. 1, 2002-Dec. 30, 2005 (period 3). RESULTS: Overall, 1048 eligible injection drug users were included in our study. Of these, 137 acquired HIV infection during follow-up. The mean proportion of participants who reported daily smoking of crack cocaine increased from 11.6% in period 1 to 39.7% in period 3. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the risk of HIV seroconversion among participants who were daily smokers of crack cocaine increased over time (period 1: hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-1.85; period 2: HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.01-2.80; and period 3: HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.06-7.11). INTERPRETATION: Smoking of crack cocaine was found to be an independent risk factor for HIV seroconversion among people who were injection drug users. This finding points to the urgent need for evidence-based public health initiatives targeted at people who smoke crack cocaine.
BACKGROUND: Markers of fibrinolysis, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels were studied for the evaluation of short-term effects of raloxifene administration in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Thirty-nine postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis were included in this prospective, controlled clinical study. Twenty-five women were given raloxifene hydrochloride (60 mg/day) plus calcium (500 mg/day). Age-matched controls (n = 14) were given only calcium. Plasma TAFI, tPA, and PAI-1 antigen levels were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment by commercially available ELISA kits. Variations of individuals were assessed by Wilcoxon's test. Relationship between those markers and demographic characteristics were investigated. RESULTS: Three months of raloxifene treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma TAFI antigen concentrations (16% change, P < 0.01), and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations (25% change, P < 0.05). A significant correlation was found between baseline TAFI antigen concentrations and the duration of amenorrhea (P < 0.05; r = 0.33). CONCLUSION: We suggest that the increased risk of venous thromboembolism due to raloxifene treatment may be related to increased tPA levels, but not TAFI levels.
BACKGROUND: Methadone is prescribed to heroin addicts to decrease illicit opioid use. Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with torsade de pointes (TdP) has been reported in methadone users. As heroin addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs, doctors might attribute too many episodes of syncope to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of TdP in this special population, and the high mortality in this population may, in part, be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of methadone. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study interview, ECGs and blood samples were collected in a population of adult heroin addicts treated with methadone or buprenorphine on a daily basis. Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen, 450 (approximately 52%) were included. The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs. All participants were interviewed about any experience of syncope. The association between opioid dose and QT, and methadone dose and reporting of syncope was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively. RESULTS: Methadone dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0.140 ms/mg (p = 0.002). No association between buprenorphine and QTc was found. Among the subjects treated with methadone, 28% men and 32% women had prolonged QTc interval. None of the subjects treated with buprenorphine had QTc interval >0.440 s((1/2)). A 50 mg higher methadone dose was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) times higher odds for syncope. CONCLUSIONS: Methadone is associated with QT prolongation and higher reporting of syncope in a population of heroin addicts.
BACKGROUND: Millions of individuals worldwide, particularly those living in rural and developing areas, are exposed to harmful levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in their drinking water. Inorganic As exposure during key developmental periods is associated with a variety of adverse health effects including those that are evident in adulthood. There is considerable interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms that relate early-life iAs exposure to the development of these latent diseases, particularly in relationship to cancer. OBJECTIVES: This work summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of cancer development in adulthood that is associated with early-life iAs exposure. DISCUSSION: Epigenetic reprogramming that imparts functional changes in gene expression, the development of cancer stem cells, and immunomodulation are plausible underlying mechanisms by which early-life iAs exposure elicits latent carcinogenic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is mounting that relates early-life iAs exposure and cancer development later in life. Future research should include animal studies that address mechanistic hypotheses and studies of human populations that integrate early-life exposure, molecular alterations, and latent disease outcomes.
BACKGROUND: More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith (1973) reported on the devastation caused by alcohol exposure on fetal development, the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged. Early identification of fetal alcohol exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes. This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting alcohol-related fetal growth impairment. METHODS: We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief alcohol intervention study. The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies. Because intensity of alcohol consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes, separate analyses were conducted for the heavy (average of >or=5 drinks per drinking day) alcohol consumers. Fetal measures from the heavy-exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal, uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics. Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and drug abuse. RESULTS: Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies. When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies, fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non-alcohol-exposed group, regardless of prior drinking patterns. Any alcohol consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in reduced cerebellar growth as well as decreased cranial to body growth in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers. Amphetamine abuse was predictive of larger cranial to body growth ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies. Although the reliance on self-reported drinking is a limitation in this study, these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal alcohol effects.
BACKGROUND: Most patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with cocaine-associated chest pain are admitted for at least 12 hours and receive a "rule out acute coronary syndrome" protocol, often with noninvasive testing prior to discharge. In patients without cocaine use, coronary computerized tomography angiography (CTA) has been shown to be useful for identifying a group of patients at low risk for cardiac events who can be safely discharged. It is unclear whether a coronary CTA strategy would be efficacious in cocaine-associated chest pain, as coronary vasospasm may account for some of the ischemia. We studied whether a negative coronary CTA in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain could identify a subset safe for discharge. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary CTA for low-risk patients who presented to the ED with cocaineassociated chest pain (self-reported or positive urine test). Consecutive patients received either immediate coronary CTA in the ED (without serial markers) or underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measurements. Patients with negative coronary CTA (maximal stenosis less than 50%) were discharged. The main outcome was 30-day cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients with cocaine-associated chest pain were evaluated. Patients had a mean age of 45.6 +/- 6.6 yrs and were 86% black, 66% male. Seventy-nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ECG and 85% had a TIMI score <2. Twenty patients received coronary CTA immediately in the ED, 18 of whom were discharged following CTA (90%). Thirty-nine received coronary CTA after a brief observation period, with 37 discharged home following CTA (95%). Six patients had coronary stenosis >or=50%. During the 30-day follow-up period, no patients died of a cardiovascular event (0%; 95% CI, 0-6.1%) and no patient sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction (0%; 95% CI, 0-6.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Although cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia can result from coronary vasoconstriction, patients with cocaine associated chest pain, a non-ischemic ECG, and a TIMI risk score <2 may be safely discharged from the ED after a negative coronary CTA with a low risk of 30-day adverse events.
BACKGROUND: Mutations in the LDLR gene are the most frequent cause of Familial hypercholesterolemia, an autosomal dominant disease characterised by elevated concentrations of LDL in blood plasma. In many populations, large genomic rearrangements account for approximately 10% of mutations in the LDLR gene. METHODS: DNA diagnostics of large genomic rearrangements was based on Multiple Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). Subsequent analyses of deletion and duplication breakpoints were performed using long-range PCR, PCR, and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: In set of 1441 unrelated FH patients, large genomic rearrangements were found in 37 probands. Eight different types of rearrangements were detected, from them 6 types were novel, not described so far. In all rearrangements, we characterized their exact extent and breakpoint sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Sequence analysis of deletion and duplication breakpoints indicates that intrachromatid non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between Alu elements is involved in 6 events, while a non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is implicated in 2 rearrangements. Our study thus describes for the first time NHEJ as a mechanism involved in genomic rearrangements in the LDLR gene.
BACKGROUND: Mutations in the MEF2A gene, coding for a member of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 family of transcription factors, have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (MI). In particular, a 21-bp deletion and 3 missense mutations were demonstrated either to reduce MEF2A transcriptional activity or to impair its nuclear translocation. However, the association of MEF2A with coronary artery disease/MI was not confirmed in other studies. We analyzed the role of MEF2A in the pathogenesis of MI in 2008 Italian patients with premature MI and in 2008 controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mutational screening of exon 8 (containing all so-far reported point mutations) disclosed 5 novel and 2 previously described missense mutations. Microsatellite genotyping and sequencing revealed the presence of the 21-bp deletion (located in exon 12) in 5 cases and in none of the controls. Functional studies on mutant proteins showed no alteration, neither in the transactivating properties (all mutants) nor in the nuclear localization (21-bp deletion). Furthermore, an association analysis performed using 3 microsatellites at the MEF2A locus showed no significant association with MI. These results were confirmed in a replication study performed on an independent Italian population with coronary artery disease. CONCLUSIONS: All together, our data do not support MEF2A as a susceptibility gene for coronary artery disease/MI in the Italian population.
BACKGROUND: Nephronophthisis (NPHP), a rare recessive cystic kidney disease, is the most frequent genetic cause of chronic renal failure in children and young adults. Mutations in nine genes (NPHP1-9) have been identified. NPHP can be associated with retinal degeneration (Senior-Loken syndrome), brainstem and cerebellar anomalies (Joubert syndrome), or liver fibrosis. METHODS: To identify a causative gene for the subset of patients with associated liver fibrosis, the authors performed a genome wide linkage search in a consanguineous family with three affected patients using 50K SNP microarrays and homozygosity mapping. RESULTS: The authors obtained a significant maximum parametric LOD (logarithm of odds) score of Z(max) = 3.72 on chromosome 8q22 and identified a homozygous missense mutation in the gene MKS3/TMEM67. When examining a worldwide cohort of 62 independent patients with NPHP and associated liver fibrosis we identified altogether four novel mutations (p.W290L, p.C615R, p.G821S, and p.G821R) in five of them. Mutations of MKS3/TMEM67, found recently in Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) type 3 and Joubert syndrome (JBTS) type 6, are predominantly truncating mutations. In contrast, the mutations detected here in patients with NPHP and associated liver fibrosis are exclusively missense mutations. This suggests that they may represent hypomorphic alleles, leading to a milder phenotype compared with the more severe MKS or JBTS phenotype. Additionally, mutation analysis for MKS3/TMEM67 in 120 patients with JBTS yielded seven different (four novel) mutations in five patients, four of whom also presented with congenital liver fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Hypomorphic MKS3/TMEM67 mutations cause NPHP with liver fibrosis (NPHP11). This is the first report of MKS3 mutations in patients with no vermian agenesis and without neurological signs. Thus NPHP, JBTS, and MKS represent allelic disorders.
BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation occurs after seizures and is implicated in epileptogenesis. CCR2 is a chemokine receptor for CCL2 and their interaction mediates monocyte infiltration in the neuroinflammatory cascade triggered in different brain pathologies. In this work CCR2 and CCL2 expression were examined following status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine injection. METHODS: SE was induced by pilocarpine injection. Control rats were injected with saline instead of pilocarpine. Five days after SE, CCR2 staining in neurons and glial cells was examined using imunohistochemical analyses. The number of CCR2 positive cells was determined using stereology probes in the hippocampus. CCL2 expression in the hippocampus was examined by molecular assay. RESULTS: Increased CCR2 was observed in the hippocampus after SE. Seizures also resulted in alterations to the cell types expressing CCR2. Increased numbers of neurons that expressed CCR2 was observed following SE. Microglial cells were more closely apposed to the CCR2-labeled cells in SE rats. In addition, rats that experienced SE exhibited CCR2-labeling in populations of hypertrophied astrocytes, especially in CA1 and dentate gyrus. These CCR2+ astroctytes were not observed in control rats. Examination of CCL2 expression showed that it was elevated in the hippocampus following SE. CONCLUSION: The data show that CCR2 and CCL2 are up-regulated in the hippocampus after pilocarpine-induced SE. Seizures also result in changes to CCR2 receptor expression in neurons and astrocytes. These changes might be involved in detrimental neuroplasticity and neuroinflammatory changes that occur following seizures.
BACKGROUND: Nicotine polacrilex lozenges deliver 25% to 27% more nicotine compared with equivalent doses of nicotine polacrilex gum. The increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge has raised questions about the relative safety of the lozenge and gum. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the safety profiles of the 4-mg nicotine lozenge and 4-mg nicotine gum in smokers with selected label-restricted diseases. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study in adult smokers with heart disease, hypertension not controlled by medication, and/or diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the 4-mg nicotine lozenge or 4-mg nicotine gum. Safety assessments were made at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks after the start of product use. RESULTS: Nine hundred one patients were randomized to treatment, 447 who received the lozenge and 454 who received the gum (safety population). The majority were women (52.7%). Patients' mean age was 53.9 years, their mean weight was 193.9 pounds, and they smoked a mean of 25.2 cigarettes per day at baseline. Five hundred fifty-three patients, 264 taking the lozenge and 289 taking the gum, used the study product for > or =4 days per week during the first 2 weeks (evaluable population). The nicotine lozenge and nicotine gum were equally well tolerated, despite increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge. The incidence of adverse events in the 2 groups was similar during the first 2 weeks of product use (evaluation population: 55.3% lozenge, 54.7% gum), as well as during the entire study (safety population: 63.8% and 58.6%, respectively). Stratification of patients by sex, age, extent of concurrent smoking, extent of product use, and severity of adverse events revealed no clinically significant differences between the lozenge and gum. The most common adverse events were nausea (17.2% and 16.1%; 95% CI, -3.7 to 6.0), hiccups (10.7% and 6.6%; 95% CI, 0.5 to 7.8), and headache (8.7% and 9.9%; 95% Cl, -5.0 to 2.6). Serious adverse events were reported in 11 and 13 patients in the respective groups. Fewer than 6% of patients in either group were considered by the investigator to have a worsening of their overall disease condition during the study. The majority of patients (>60%) experienced no change in their disease status from baseline. CONCLUSION: The 4-mg nicotine lozenge and 4-mg nicotine gum had comparable safety profiles in these patients with label-restricted medical conditions.
BACKGROUND: No direct comparisons exist of the renal tolerability of the low-osmolality contrast medium iopamidol with that of the iso-osmolality contrast medium iodixanol in high-risk patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind comparison of iopamidol and iodixanol in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 20 to 59 mL/min) who underwent cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions. Serum creatinine (SCr) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications. The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 micromol/L) over baseline. Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25%, a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25%, and the mean peak change in SCr. In 414 patients, contrast volume, presence of diabetes mellitus, use of N-acetylcysteine, mean baseline SCr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups. SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg/dL occurred in 4.4% (9 of 204 patients) after iopamidol and 6.7% (14 of 210 patients) after iodixanol (P=0.39), whereas rates of SCr increases > or = 25% were 9.8% and 12.4%, respectively (P=0.44). In patients with diabetes, SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg/dL were 5.1% (4 of 78 patients) with iopamidol and 13.0% (12 of 92 patients) with iodixanol (P=0.11), whereas SCr increases > or = 25% were 10.3% and 15.2%, respectively (P=0.37). Mean post-SCr increases were significantly less with iopamidol (all patients: 0.07 versus 0.12 mg/dL, 6.2 versus 10.6 micromol/L, P=0.03; patients with diabetes: 0.07 versus 0.16 mg/dL, 6.2 versus 14.1 micromol/L, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of contrast-induced nephropathy, defined by multiple end points, is not statistically different after the intraarterial administration of iopamidol or iodixanol to high-risk patients, with or without diabetes mellitus. Any true difference between the agents is small and not likely to be clinically significant.
BACKGROUND: No susceptibility genes have been identified in human prion disase, apart from the prion protein gene (PRNP). The gene SPRN, encodes Shadoo (Sho, shadow of prion protein) which has protein homology and possible functional links with the prion protein. METHODS: A genetic screen was carried out of the open reading frame of SPRN by direct sequencing in 522 patients with prion disease, including 107 with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), and 861 healthy controls. RESULTS: A common coding variant of SPRN, two further single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and three rare insertion or deletion variants were found. A single base-pair insertion at codon 46, predicted to cause a frameshift and potentially a novel protein, was found in two patients with vCJD but not in controls (p = 0.01). Two linked SNPs, one in intron 1 and the other a missense variant at codon 7, were associated with risk of sporadic CJD (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: These data justify the functional genetic characterisation of SPRN and support the involvement of Shadoo in prion pathobiology.
BACKGROUND: One third of patients treated for hypertension attain adequate blood pressure (BP) control, and multidrug regimens are often required. Given the lifelong nature of hypertension, there is a need to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of higher doses of combination anti-hypertensive therapies. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of valsartan (VAL) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)-monotherapy and higher-dose combinations in patients with essential hypertension. METHODS: The first part of this study was an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group trial. Patients with essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic BP [MSDBP], > or =95 mm Hg and <110 mm Hg) were randomized to 1 of 8 treatment groups: VAL 160 or 320 mg; HCTZ 12.5 or 25 mg; VAL/HCTZ 160/12.5, 320/12.5, or 320/25 mg; or placebo. Mean changes in MSDBP and mean sitting systolic BP (MSSBP) were analyzed at the 8-week core study end point. VAL/HCTZ 320/12.5 and 320/25 mg were further investigated in a 54-week, open-label extension. Response was defined as MSDBP <90 mm Hg or a > or =10 mm Hg decrease compared to baseline. Control was defined as MSDBP <90 mm Hg compared with baseline. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring adverse events at randomization and all subsequent study visits and regular evaluation of hematology and blood chemistry. RESULTS: A total of 1346 patients were randomized into the 8-week core study (734 men, 612 women; 924 white, 291 black, 23 Asian, 108 other; mean age, 52.7 years; mean weight, 92.6 kg). All active treatments were associated with significantly reduced MSSBP and MSDBP during the core 8-week study, with each monotherapy significantly contributing to the overall effect of combination therapy (VAL and HCTZ, P < 0.001). Each combination was associated with significantly greater reductions in MSSBP and MSDBP compared with the monotherapies and placebo (all, P < 0.001). The mean reduction in MSSBP/MSDBP with VAL/HCTZ 320/25 mg was 24.7/16.6 mm Hg, compared with 5.9/7.0 mm Hg with placebo. The reduction in MSSBP was significantly greater with VAL/HCTZ 320/25 mg compared with VAL/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg (P < 0.002). Rates of response and BP control were significantly higher in the groups that received combination treatment compared with those that received monotherapy. The incidence of hypokalemia was lower with VAL/HCTZ combinations (1.8%-6.1%) than with HCTZ monotherapies (7.1%-13.3%). The majority of adverse events in the core study were of mild to moderate severity. The efficacy and tolerability of VAL/HCTZ combinations were maintained during the extension (797 patients). CONCLUSIONS: In this study population, combination therapies with VAL/HCTZ were associated with significantly greater BP reductions compared with either monotherapy, were well tolerated, and were associated with less hypokalemia than HCTZ alone.
BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is caused by bone resorption in excess of bone formation, and bisphosphonates, are used to inhibit bone resorption. Alendronate, a biphosphonate, is effective for both the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Side effects are relatively few and prominently gastrointestinal. Musculoskeletal pain may be an important side effect in these patients. We presented a patient admitted to our out-patient clinic with diffuse skeletal pain after three consecutive administration of alendronate. CONCLUSION: We conclude that patients with osteoporosis can report pain, and bisphosphonate-related pain should also be considered before ascribing this complaint to osteoporosis.
BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate postoperative complications and mortality after administration of aprotinin compared to tranexamic acid in an unselected, consecutive cohort. METHODS: Perioperative data from consecutive cardiac surgery patients were prospectively collected between September 2005 and June 2006 in a university-affiliated clinic (n = 1188). During the first 5 mo, 596 patients received aprotinin (Group A); in the next 5 mo, 592 patients were treated with tranexamic acid (Group T). Except for antifibrinolytic therapy, the anesthetic and surgical protocols remained unchanged. RESULTS: The pre- and intraoperative variables were comparable between the treatment groups. Postoperatively, a significantly higher incidence of seizures was found in Group T (4.6% vs 1.2%, P < 0.001). This difference was also significant in the primary valve surgery and the high risk surgery subgroups (7.9% vs 1.2%, P = 0.003; 7.3% vs 2.4%, P = 0.035, respectively). Persistent atrial fibrillation (7.9% vs 2.3%, P = 0.020) and renal failure (9.7% vs 1.7%, P = 0.002) were also more common in Group T, in the primary valve surgery subgroup. On the contrary, among primary coronary artery bypass surgery patients, there were more acute myocardial infarctions and renal dysfunction in Group A (5.8% vs 2.0%, P = 0.027; 22.5% vs 15.2%, P = 0.036, respectively). The 1-yr mortality was significantly higher after aprotinin treatment in the high risk surgery group (17.7% vs 9.8%, P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: Both antifibrinolytic drugs bear the risk of adverse outcome depending on the type of cardiac surgery. Administration of aprotinin should be avoided in coronary artery bypass graft and high risk patients, whereas administration of tranexamic acid is not recommended in valve surgery.
BACKGROUND: Pain on injection of propofol is unpleasant. We hypothesized that propofol infusion pain might be prevented by infusing remifentanil before starting the propofol infusion in a clinical setting where target-controlled infusions (TCI) of both drugs were used. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine the effect-site concentration (Ce) of remifentanil to prevent the pain without producing complications. METHODS: A total of 128 patients undergoing general surgery were randomly allocated to receive normal saline (control) or remifentanil to a target Ce of 2 ng ml(-1) (R2), 4 ng ml(-1) (R4), or 6 ng ml(-1) (R6) administered via TCI. After the target Ce was achieved, the infusion of propofol was started. Remifentanil-related complications were assessed during the remifentanil infusion, and pain caused by propofol was evaluated using a four-point scale during the propofol infusion. RESULTS: The incidence of pain was significantly lower in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups (12/32 and 6/31 vs 26/31 and 25/32, respectively, P<0.001). Pain was less severe in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups (P<0.001). However, both incidence and severity of pain were not different between Groups R4 and R6. No significant complications were observed during the study. CONCLUSIONS: During induction of anaesthesia with TCI of propofol and remifentanil, a significant reduction in propofol infusion pain was achieved without significant complications by prior administration of remifentanil at a target Ce of 4 ng ml(-1).
BACKGROUND: Papaverine hydrochloride is a direct-acting vasodilator used to manage vasospasm during various neurosurgical operations. Transient cranial nerve dysfunction has been described in a few cases with topical papaverine. This study supports previous reports and provides neurophysiological evidence of an adverse effect on the auditory nerve. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 70 consecutive microvascular decompression operations and studied those patients who received topical papaverine for vasospasm. Topical papaverine was used as a direct therapeutic action to manage vasospasm in a total of 11 patients. The timing of papaverine application and ongoing operative events was reviewed relative to changes in neurophysiological recordings. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were routinely used to monitor cochlear nerve function during these operations. FINDINGS: A temporal relationship was found between topical papaverine and BAEP changes leading to complete waveform loss. The average temporal delay between papaverine and the onset of an adverse BAEP change was 5 min. In 10 of 11 patients, BAEP waves II/III-V completely disappeared within 2 to 25 min after papaverine. Eight of these 10 patients had complete loss of BAEP waveforms within 10 min. One patient showed no recovery of later waves and a delayed profound sensorineural hearing loss. The average recovery time of BAEP waveforms to pre-papaverine baseline values was 39 min. CONCLUSIONS: Topical papaverine for the treatment of vasospasm was associated with the onset of a transient disturbance in neurophysiological function of the ascending auditory brainstem pathway. The complete disappearance of BAEP waveforms with a consistent temporal delay suggests a possible adverse effect on the proximal eighth nerve. Recommendations to avoid potential cranial nerve deficits from papaverine are provided.
BACKGROUND: Patients with primary systemic amyloidosis (AL) have a poor prognosis. Median survival time from standard treatments is only 17 months. High-dose intravenous melphalan followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) appears to be the most promising therapy, but treatment mortality can be high. The authors have noted the development of acute renal insufficiency immediately after melphalan conditioning. This study was undertaken to further examine its risk factors and impact on posttransplant mortality. METHODS: Consecutive AL patients who underwent PBSCT were studied retrospectively. Acute renal insufficiency (ARI) after high-dose melphalan was defined by a minimum increase of 0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) in the serum creatinine level that is greater than 50% of baseline immediately after conditioning. Urine sediment score was the sum of the individual types of sediment identified on urine microscopy. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients studied, ARI developed in 18.8% of the patients after high-dose melphalan. Univariate analysis identified age, hypoalbuminemia, heavy proteinuria, diuretic use, and urine sediment score (>3) as risk factors. Age and urine sediment score remained independently significant risk factors in the multivariate analysis. Patients who had ARI after high-dose melphalan underwent dialysis more often (P = 0.007), and had a worse 1-year survival (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The timing of renal injury strongly suggests melphalan as the causative agent. Ongoing tubular injury may be a prerequisite for renal injury by melphalan as evidenced by the active urinary sediment. Development of ARI adversely affected the outcome after PBSCT. Effective preventive measures may help decrease the treatment mortality of PBSCT in AL patients.
BACKGROUND: Pemoline is an oxazolidine derivative that is structurally different from amphetamines and used in the treatment of attention deficit disorder. Pemoline has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute movement disorders. The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with pemoline who experienced profound choreoathetosis. CASE REPORT: Two, 3-year-old male, identical twin siblings presented to the emergency department after found playing with a an empty bottle of pemoline originally containing 59 tablets. The children had a medical history significant for attention deficit disorder previously treated with methylphenidate without success. This was their first day of pemoline therapy. The choreoathetoid movements began 45 min to 1 h after ingestion. The children gave no history of prior movement disorders and there was no family history of movement disorders. The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous benzodiazepines in an attempt to control the choreoathetoid movements. Despite treatment, the children continued to have choreoathetosis for approximately 24 hours. Forty-eight hours after admission, the children appeared to be at their baseline and were discharged home. CONCLUSION: Pemoline associated movement disorder has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology literature. The possibility of choreoathetoid movements should be considered in patients presenting after pemoline overdose.
BACKGROUND: Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short-term follow-up. METHODS: Forty patients with Parkinson's disease underwent serial, detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal ("off" period) and while taking their optimal medical regimens ("on" period). All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year, and 11 at two years. RESULTS: The percent improvements at six months were as follows: off-period score for overall motor function, 28 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 38 percent), with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs; off-period score for activities of daily living, 29 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 39 percent); on-period score for contralateral dyskinesias, 82 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 91 percent); and on-period score for ipsilateral dyskinesias, 44 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 59 percent). The improvements in dyskinesias and the total scores for off-period parkinsonism, contralateral bradykinesia, and rigidity were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years. The improvement in ipsilateral dyskinesias was lost after one year, and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months. Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery. The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in the use of medication. CONCLUSIONS: In late-stage Parkinson's disease, pallidotomy significantly reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias and off-period disability. Much of the benefit is sustained at two years, although some improvements, such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms, wane within the first year. The on-period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy.
BACKGROUND: Pre-treatment with lipid emulsions has been shown to increase lethal doses of bupivacaine, and the lipid content of propofol may alleviate bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of propofol in intralipid or medialipid emulsions on bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity. METHODS: Rats were anaesthetised with ketamine and were given 0.5 mg/kg/min propofol in intralipid (Group P), propofol in medialipid (Group L), or saline (Group C) over 20 min. Thereafter, 2 mg/kg/min bupivacaine 0.5% was infused. We recorded time to first dysrhythmia occurrence, respective times to 25% and 50% reduction of the heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure, and time to asystole and total amount of bupivacaine consumption. Blood and tissue samples were collected following asystole. RESULTS: The time to first dysrhythmia occurrence, time to 25% and 50% reductions in HR, and time to asystole were longer in Group P than the other groups. The cumulative bupivacaine dose given at those time points was higher in Group P. Plasma bupivacaine levels were significantly lower in Group P than in Group C. Bupivacaine levels in the brain and heart were significantly lower in Group P and Group L than in Group C. CONCLUSION: We conclude that pre-treatment with propofol in intralipid, compared with propofol in medialipid or saline, delayed the onset of bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxic effects as well as reduced plasma bupivacaine levels. Further studies are needed to explore tissue bupivacaine levels of propofol in medialipid and adapt these results to clinical practice.
BACKGROUND: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that yohimbine facilitates sexual behavior and may be helpful in the treatment of male impotence. A single case report suggests that yohimbine may be used to treat the sexual side effects of clomipramine. This study evaluated yohimbine as a treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers. METHOD: Six patients with either obsessive compulsive disorder, trichotillomania, anxiety, or affective disorders who suffered sexual side effects after treatment with serotonin reuptake blockers were given yohimbine on a p.r.n. basis in an open clinical trial. Various doses of yohimbine were used to determine the ideal dose for each patient. RESULTS: Five of the six patients experienced improved sexual functioning after taking yohimbine. One patient who failed to comply with yohimbine treatment had no therapeutic effects. Side effects of yohimbine included excessive sweating, increased anxiety, and a wound-up feeling in some patients. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that yohimbine may be an effective treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers. Future controlled studies are needed to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of yohimbine for this indication.
BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans, and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation. The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the US, using both acute noxious stimulation and capsaicin-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity. METHODS: Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 65 volunteers were studied in two trials: an open-label, dose-escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0.25-2.0 mg and a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adenosine, 2 mg. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal capsaicin injection were determined. RESULTS: Adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal capsaicin injection for at least 24 h. In contrast, residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short (< 4 h). CONCLUSIONS: These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity, presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injection. The long-lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic neuropathic pain and is not due to prolonged residence of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid.
BACKGROUND: Prolonged administration of indinavir is associated with the occurrence of a variety of renal complications in adults. These well-documented side effects have restricted the use of this potent protease inhibitor in children. DESIGN: A prospective study to monitor indinavir-related nephrotoxicity in a cohort of 30 human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children treated with indinavir. METHODS: Urinary pH, albumin, creatinine, the presence of erythrocytes, leukocytes, bacteria and crystals, and culture were analyzed every 3 months for 96 weeks. Serum creatinine levels were routinely determined at the same time points. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of indinavir were done at week 4 after the initiation of indinavir. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia (> or =75 cells/ micro L in at least 2 consecutive visits) after 96 weeks was 53%. Persistent sterile leukocyturia was frequently associated with a mild increase in the urine albumin/creatinine ratio and by microscopic hematuria. The cumulative incidence of serum creatinine levels >50% above normal was 33% after 96 weeks. Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had serum creatinine levels of 50% above normal than those children without persistent sterile leukocyturia. In children younger than 5.6 years, persistent sterile leukocyturia was significantly more frequent than in older children. A higher cumulative incidence of persistent leukocyturia was found in children with an area under the curve >19 mg/L x h or a peak serum level of indinavir >12 mg/L. In 4 children, indinavir was discontinued because of nephrotoxicity. Subsequently, the serum creatinine levels decreased, the urine albumin/creatinine ratios returned to zero, and the leukocyturia disappeared within 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Children treated with indinavir have a high cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia. Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had an increase in serum creatinine levels of >50% above normal. Younger children have an additional risk for renal complications. The impairment of the renal function in these children occurred in the absence of clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis. Indinavir-associated nephrotoxicity must be monitored closely, especially in children with risk factors such as persistent sterile leukocyturia, age <5.6 years, an area under the curve of indinavir >19 mg/L x h, and a C(max) >12 mg/L.
BACKGROUND: Propofol is frequently used for general anesthesia in children although little is known about possible genotoxic effects in humans. We investigated the formation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in metaphase chromosomes of T-lymphocytes of children as a marker for possible genotoxocity following total intravenous anesthesia with propofol for minor surgical procedures. METHODS: 40 children ASA classification I-III were included (ASA I n=34, ASA II n=5, ASA III n=1) in the study. Anesthesia was induced by propofol (3mg/kg) and alfentanil. Succinylcholine or rocuronium were administered for muscle relaxation. After tracheal intubation anesthesia was maintained by continuous propofol infusion at 12 mg/(kgh). Blood samples were drawn before induction and after termination of anesthesia. Following a 72 h cell culture period, 25 T-lymphocyte metaphases per blood sample for all children were analyzed for SCE frequencies. RESULTS: Total intravenous anesthesia with propofol on children did not influence SCE rates in metaphase chromosomes of T-lymphocytes. No SCE differences could be detected between blood samples before initiation and after termination of anesthesia (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Slightly elevated SCE rates were obtained in T-lymphocytes of girls compared to boys, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol anesthesia under the chosen conditions did not induce the formation of SCE in children in vivo. No genotoxic effect of a short term exposure to propofol during pediatric anesthesia had been observed.
BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms (TNSs) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine. However, identification of a short-acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal. Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine. Accordingly, the present, prospective double-blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs. METHODS: Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2.5 ml 2% lidocaine in 7.5% glucose, 2% prilocaine in 7.5% glucose, or 0.5% bupivacaine in 7.5% glucose. All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy. Details of spinal puncture, extension and regression of spinal block, and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted. In the evening of postoperative day 1, patients were evaluated for TNSs by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure. RESULTS: Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs, 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine (P = 0.03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had TNSs. Times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine (150 vs. 165 min and 238 vs. 253 min, respectively) but prolonged after bupivacaine (200 and 299 min, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Prilocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of TNSs.
BACKGROUND: Recent studies confirmed a high incidence of sensory axonal neuropathy in patients treated with different doses of thalidomide. The study's aims were to measure variations in sural nerve sensory action potential (SAP) amplitude in patients with refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) treated with thalidomide and use these findings to identify the neurotoxic potential of thalidomide and the recovery capacity of sensory fibres after discontinuation of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and electrophysiological data in 12 female patients with CLE during treatment with thalidomide and up to 47 months after discontinuation of treatment were analysed. Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction > or =40% was the criteria for discontinuing therapy. RESULTS: During treatment, 11 patients showed a reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude compared to baseline values (9 with a reduction > or =50% and 2 <50%). One patient showed no changes in SAP amplitude. Five patients complained of paresthesias and leg cramps. After thalidomide treatment, sural SAP amplitude recovered in 3 patients. At detection of reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude, the median thalidomide cumulative dose was 21.4 g. The threshold neurotoxic dosage is lower than previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction is a reliable and sensitive marker of degeneration and recovery of sensory fibres. This electrophysiological parameter provides information about subclinical neurotoxic potential of thalidomide but is not helpful in predicting the appearance of sensory symptoms.
BACKGROUND: Renal dysfunction induced by iodinated contrast medium (CM) administration can minimize the benefit of the interventional procedure in patients undergoing renal angioplasty (PTRA). PURPOSE: To compare the susceptibility to nephrotoxic effect of CM in patients undergoing PTRA with that of patients submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients successfully treated with PTRA (PTRA group, mean age 70+/-12 years, 23 female, basal creatinine 1.46+/-0.79, range 0.7-4.9 mg/dl) were compared with 33 patients undergoing successful PCI (PCI group), matched for basal creatinine (1.44+/-0.6, range 0.7-3.4 mg/dl), gender, and age. In both groups postprocedural (48 h) serum creatinine was measured. RESULTS: Postprocedural creatinine level decreased nonsignificantly in the PTRA group (1.46+/-0.8 vs. 1.34+/-0.5 mg/dl, P=NS) and increased significantly in the PCI group (1.44+/-0.6 vs. 1.57+/-0.7 mg/dl, P<0.02). Changes in serum creatinine after intervention (after-before) were significantly different between the PTRA and PCI groups (-0.12+/-0.5 vs. 0.13+/-0.3, P=0.014). This difference was not related to either a different clinical risk profile or to the volume of CM administered. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study patients submitted to PTRA showed a lower susceptibility to renal damage induced by CM administration than PCI patients. The effectiveness of PTRA on renal function seems to be barely influenced by CM toxicity.
BACKGROUND: Risperidone, a potent antagonist of both serotonergic (5HT2A) and dopaminergic D2 receptors is associated with hyperprolactinemia in adults and children. Chronically elevated prolactin levels in children with prolactinomas may be associated with arrested growth and development resulting in either delayed puberty or short stature. These possibilities stress the importance of developing a safe and effective approach to drug-induced hyperprolactinemia in youth. We report the successful treatment of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia with cabergoline in youth. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia treated with cabergoline. RESULTS: Four males (age 6-11 years) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) bipolar disorder or psychoses, with risperidone-induced elevations in serum prolactin levels (57.5-129 ng/mL, normal 5-15 ng/mL), were treated with cabergoline (mean dose 2.13 +/- 0.09 mg/week). When serum prolactin levels normalized in all four subjects (mean 11.2 +/- 10.9 ng/mL), the cabergoline dose was reduced to 1 mg/week in three of four subjects. The mean duration of therapy with cabergoline was 523.5 +/- 129.7 days, and the mean duration of therapy with risperidone was 788.5 +/- 162.5 days. Cabergoline was well tolerated without adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Cabergoline may be useful for the treatment of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia in youth; however, further research is needed.
BACKGROUND: S-53482 and S-23121 are N-phenylimide herbicides and produced embryolethality, teratogenicity (mainly ventricular septal defects and wavy ribs), and growth retardation in rats in conventional oral developmental toxicity studies. Our objective in this study was to investigate whether the compounds induce developmental toxicity via the dermal route, which is more relevant to occupational exposure, hence better addressing human health risks. METHODS: S-53482 was administered dermally to rats at 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg during organogenesis, and S-23121 was administered at 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg (the maximum applicable dose level). Fetuses were obtained by a Cesarean section and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal alterations. RESULTS: Dermal exposure of rats to S-53482 at 300 mg/kg produced patterns of developmental toxicity similar to those resulting from oral exposure. Toxicity included embryolethality, teratogenicity, and growth retardation. Dermal administration of S-23121 at 800 mg/kg resulted in an increased incidence of embryonic death and ventricular septal defect, but retarded fetal growth was not observed as it was following oral exposure to S-23121. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, S-53482 and S-23121 were teratogenic when administered dermally to pregnant rats as were the compounds administered orally. Thus, investigation of the mechanism and its human relevancy become more important.
BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) to be an active antineoplastic agent in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, with dose limiting toxicity of the standard dosing regimen (50 mg/m(2) q 4 weeks) being severe erythrodysesthesia ("hand-foot syndrome") and stomatitis. We wished to develop a more tolerable liposomal doxorubicin treatment regimen and document its level of activity in a well-defined patient population with platinum/paclitaxel-refractory disease. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with ovarian or fallopian tube cancers or primary peritoneal carcinoma with platinum/paclitaxel-refractory disease (stable or progressive disease following treatment with these agents or previous objective response <3 months in duration) were treated with liposomal doxorubicin at a dose of 40 mg/m(2) q 4 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients (median age: 60; range 41-81) entered this phase 2 trial. The median number of prior regimens was 2 (range: 1-6). Six (12%) and 4 (8%) patients experienced grade 2 hand-foot syndrome and stomatitis, respectively (no episodes of grade 3). One patient developed grade 3 diarrhea requiring hospitalization for hydration. Six (12%) individuals required dose reductions. The median number of courses of liposomal doxorubicin administered on this protocol was 2 (range: 1-12). Four of 44 patients (9%) evaluable for response exhibited objective and subjective evidence of an antineoplastic effect of therapy. CONCLUSION: This modified liposomal doxorubicin regimen results in less toxicity (stomatitis, hand-foot syndrome) than the standard FDA-approved dose schedule. Definite, although limited, antineoplastic activity is observed in patients with well-defined platinum- and paclitaxel-refractory ovarian cancer.
BACKGROUND: Sirolimus (SRL) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation. These are nephrotoxic, but SRL seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects, although this question is still open. In a number of treatment protocols where SRL was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described. The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function, including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with either cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus (FK506) or SRL as monotherapies or in different combinations. METHODS: For a period of 2 weeks, CsA 15 mg/kg/day (given orally), FK506 3.0 mg/kg/day (given orally) or SRL 0.4 mg/kg/day (given intraperitoneally) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 'conscious catheterized rat' model, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured as the clearance of Cr(EDTA). The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi-quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis, subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules, plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red. RESULTS: CsA, FK506 and SRL all significantly decreased the GFR. A further deterioration was seen when CsA was combined with either FK506 or SRL, whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with FK506 plus SRL when compared with treatment with any of the single substances. The morphological changes presented a similar pattern. The semi-quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL (P<0.001 compared with controls) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls (P<0.02). The FK506 plus SRL combination showed only a marginally higher degree of fibrosis as compared with controls (P=0.05). CONCLUSION: This rat study demonstrated a synergistic nephrotoxic effect of CsA plus SRL, whereas FK506 plus SRL was better tolerated.
BACKGROUND: Sirolimus (formerly rapamycin) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T-cell activation. After 2 individuals with psoriasis developed a capillary leak syndrome following treatment with oral sirolimus lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis. OBSERVATIONS: A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with sirolimus-induced capillary leak syndrome had a 2.3-fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells (to 48%) compared with an unaffected sirolimus-treated patient with psoriasis (21%). Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with psoriasis tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or dexamethasone-induced apoptosis than did normal T cells, particularly in the presence of sirolimus. CONCLUSIONS: Severe adverse effects of sirolimus include fever, anemia, and capillary leak syndrome. These symptoms may be the result of drug-induced apoptosis of lesional leukocytes, especially activated T lymphocytes, and possibly release of inflammatory mediators. Because patients with severe psoriasis may develop capillary leak from various systemic therapies, clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with inflammatory diseases who are treated with immune modulators.
BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection, and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based regimens. To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus. We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use. In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999-2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen. In these patients, the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:creatinine ratios, an estimate of grams of proteinuria/day. Laboratory results were compared between prior, during and following sirolimus use. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (24%) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post-transplantation course. In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive. In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic-range proteinuria. Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables. In most patients, discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease, but not resolution, of proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus induces or aggravates pre-existing proteinuria in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients. Proteinuria may improve, but does not resolve, when sirolimus is withdrawn.
BACKGROUND: Sister chromatid separation is initiated by separase, a protease that cleaves cohesin and thereby dissolves sister chromatid cohesion. Separase is activated by the degradation of its inhibitor securin and by the removal of inhibitory phosphates. In human cells, separase activation also coincides with the cleavage of separase, but it is not known if this reaction activates separase, which protease cleaves separase, and how separase cleavage is regulated.RESULTS: Inhibition of separase expression in human cells by RNA interference causes the formation of polyploid cells with large lobed nuclei. In mitosis, many of these cells contain abnormal chromosome plates with unseparated sister chromatids. Inhibitor binding experiments in vitro reveal that securin prevents the access of substrate analogs to the active site of separase. Upon securin degradation, the active site of full-length separase becomes accessible, allowing rapid autocatalytic cleavage of separase at one of three sites. The resulting N- and C-terminal fragments remain associated and can be reinhibited by securin. A noncleavable separase mutant retains its ability to cleave cohesin in vitro.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that separase is required for sister chromatid separation during mitosis in human cells. Our data further indicate that securin inhibits separase by blocking the access of substrates to the active site of separase. Securin proteolysis allows autocatalytic processing of separase into a cleaved form, but separase cleavage is not essential for separase activation.
BACKGROUND: Spinal anaesthesia is widely employed in clinical practice but has the main drawback of post-spinal block hypotension. Efforts must therefore continue to be made to obviate this setback OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cardiovascular and respiratory changes during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia. METHODS: With ethical approval, we studied 74 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), physical status class 1 and 2 patients scheduled for elective unilateral lower limb surgery. Patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups: lateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia groups. In the lateral position with operative side down, patients recived 10 mg (2mls) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine through a 25-gauge spinal needle. Patients in the unilateral group were maintained in the lateral position for 15 minutes following spinal injection while those in the conventional group were turned supine immediately after injection. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were monitored over 1 hour. RESULTS: Three patients (8.1%) in the unilateral group and 5 (13.5%) in the conventional group developed hypotension, P= 0.71. Four (10.8%) patients in the conventional group and 1 (2.7%) in the unilateral group, P= 0.17 required epinephrine infusion to treat hypotension. Patients in the conventional group had statistically significant greater fall in the systolic blood pressures at 15, 30 and 45 minutes when compared to the baseline (P= 0.003, 0.001 and 0.004). The mean respiratory rate and oxygen saturations in the two groups were similar. CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional spinal anaesthesia, unilateral spinal anaesthesia was associated with fewer cardiovascular perturbations. Also, the type of spinal block instituted affected neither the respiratory rate nor the arterial oxygen saturation.
BACKGROUND: Spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are handicapped by under-reporting and limited detail on individual cases. We report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of liver failure in two of our patients. METHODS: Serious ADR reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years. Patients', who had hepatotoxicity on sulfasalazine and met a definition of a serious ADR, were identified. Two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument. The likely frequency of hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions. RESULTS: Ten cases were identified: eight occurred during surveillance. Eight patients were hospitalised, two in hepatic failure - one died after a liver transplant. All but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treatment. Seven patients had a skin rash, three eosinophilia and one interstitial nephritis. Five patients were of Black British of African or Caribbean descent. Liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six. Drug-related hepatotoxicity was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patients. The likely frequency of serious hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated at 0.4% of treated patients. CONCLUSION: Serious hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine appears to be under-appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important.
BACKGROUND: Studies on the association between the long-term use of aspirin and other analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have given conflicting results. In order to examine this association, a case-control study with incident cases of ESRD was carried out. METHODS: The cases were all patients entering the local dialysis program because of ESRD in the study area between June 1, 1995 and November 30, 1997. They were classified according to the underlying disease, which had presumably led them to ESRD. Controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals from where the cases arose, also matched by age and sex. Odds ratios were calculated using a conditional logistic model, including potential confounding factors, both for the whole study population and for the various underlying diseases. RESULTS: Five hundred and eighty-three cases and 1190 controls were included in the analysis. Long-term use of any analgesic was associated with an overall odds ratio of 1.22 (95% CI, 0.89-1.66). For specific groups of drugs, the risks were 1.56 (1.05-2.30) for aspirin, 1.03 (0.60-1.76) for pyrazolones, 0.80 (0.39-1.63) for paracetamol, and 0.94 (0.57-1.56) for nonaspirin NSAIDs. The risk of ESRD associated with aspirin was related to the cumulated dose and duration of use, and it was particularly high among the subset of patients with vascular nephropathy as underlying disease [2.35 (1.17-4.72)]. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that long-term use of nonaspirin analgesic drugs and NSAIDs is not associated with an increased risk of ESRD. However, the chronic use of aspirin may increase the risk of ESRD.
BACKGROUND: Succinylcholine commonly produces frequent adverse effects, including muscle fasciculation and myalgia. The current study identified the optimal dose of rocuronium to prevent succinylcholine-induced fasciculation and myalgia and evaluated the influence of rocuronium on the speed of onset produced by succinylcholine. METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded study was conducted in 100 patients randomly allocated into five groups of 20 patients each. Patients were randomized to receive 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.06 mg/kg rocuronium as a precurarizing dose. Neuromuscular monitoring after each precurarizing dose was recorded from the adductor pollicis muscle using acceleromyography with train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. All patients received succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg at 2 minutes after the precurarization, and were assessed the incidence and severity of fasciculations, while myalgia was assessed at 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS: The incidence and severity of visible muscle fasciculation was significantly less with increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium (P < 0.001). Those of myalgia tend to decrease according to increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium, but there was no significance (P = 0.072). The onset time of succinylcholine was significantly longer with increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Precurarization with 0.04 mg/kg rocuronium was the optimal dose considering the reduction in the incidence and severity of fasciculation and myalgia with acceptable onset time, and the safe and effective precurarization.
BACKGROUND: TEE is a semi-invasive tool broadly used and its utilization associated to sedatives drugs might to affect the procedure safety. OBJECTIVE: to analyze aspects of TEE safety associated to the use of Midazolan (MZ) and Flumazenil (FL) and the influence of the clinical variables on the event rate. METHOD: prospective study with 137 patients that underwent TEE with MZ associated to moderate sedation. We analyzed the following events: complications related with the topical anesthesia, with MZ use and with the procedure. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to test the influence of the clinical variables: age, sex, stroke, myocardiopathy (MP), duration of the test, mitral regurgitation (MR) and the MZ dose. RESULTS: All patients (65+/-16 yrs; 58% males) finished the examination. The mean doses of MZ and FL were 4.3+/-1.9 mg and 0.28+/-0.2 mg, respectively. The duration of the examination and the mean ejection fraction (EF) were 16.4+/-6.1 minutes and 60+/-9%, respectively. Mild hypoxia (SO2<90%) was the most common event (11 patients); 3 patients (2%) presented transient hypoxia due to upper airway obstruction by probe introduction and 8 (5.8%) due to hypoxia caused by MZ use. Transient hypotension (SAP<90mmHg) occurred in 1 patient (0.7%). The multivariate analysis showed that severe MR, MP (EF<45%) and high doses of MZ (>5mg) were associated with events (p<0.001). The EF was 40%, in the group with MP and 44% in the group with severe MR and it can be a factor associated with clinical events in the last group. CONCLUSION: TEE with sedation presents a low rate of events. There were no severe events and there was no need to interrupt the examinations.
BACKGROUND: Tacrolimus ointment is increasingly used for anti-inflammatory treatment of sensitive areas such as the face, and recent observations indicate that the treatment is effective in steroid-aggravated rosacea and perioral dermatitis. We report on rosaceiform dermatitis as a complication of treatment with tacrolimus ointment. OBSERVATIONS: Six adult patients with inflammatory facial dermatoses were treated with tacrolimus ointment because of the ineffectiveness of standard treatments. Within 2 to 3 weeks of initially effective and well-tolerated treatment, 3 patients with a history of rosacea and 1 with a history of acne experienced sudden worsening with pustular rosaceiform lesions. Biopsy revealed an abundance of Demodex mites in 2 of these patients. In 1 patient with eyelid eczema, rosaceiform periocular dermatitis gradually appeared after 3 weeks of treatment. In 1 patient with atopic dermatitis, telangiectatic and papular rosacea insidiously appeared after 5 months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that the spectrum of rosaceiform dermatitis as a complication of treatment with tacrolimus ointment is heterogeneous. A variety of factors, such as vasoactive properties of tacrolimus, proliferation of Demodex due to local immunosuppression, and the occlusive properties of the ointment, may be involved in the observed phenomena. Future studies are needed to identify individual risk factors.
BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is a candidate chemopreventive agent in breast cancer, although the drug may be associated with the development of endometrial cancer. Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive. METHODS: In October, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women (mainly in Italy) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy. Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years. The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years' follow-up. In June, 1997, the trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study. Recruitment ended on July 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned. The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer. This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow-up of 46 months for major endpoints. 41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far; there have been no deaths from breast cancer. There is no difference in breast-cancer frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and tamoxifen (19) arms. There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen. Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen. INTERPRETATION: Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of breast cancer, the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent. Women using hormone-replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen. There were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study. It is essential to continue follow-up to quantify the long-term risks and benefits of tamoxifen therapy.
BACKGROUND: The 24-hour continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid (FA) as part of several new multidrug chemotherapy regimens in advanced gastric cancer (AGC) has shown to be effective, with low toxicity. In a previous phase II study with 3-weekly bolus 5-FU, FA and mitomycin C (MMC) we found a low toxicity rate and response rates comparable to those of regimens such as ELF, FAM or FAMTX, and a promising median overall survival. In order to improve this MMC-dependent schedule we initiated a phase II study with high-dose 5-FU/FA and 3-weekly bolus MMC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From February, 1998 to September, 2000 we recruited 33 patients with AGC to receive weekly 24-hour 5-FU 2,600 mg/m(2) preceded by 2-hour FA 500 mg/m(2) for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. Bolus MMC 10 mg/m(2) was added in 3-weekly intervals. Treatment given on an outpatient basis, using portable pump systems, was repeated on day 57. Patients' characteristics were: male/female ratio 20/13; median age 57 (27-75) years; median WHO status 1 (0-2). 18 patients had a primary AGC, and 15 showed a relapsed AGC. Median follow-up was 11.8 months (range of those surviving: 2.7-11.8 months). RESULTS: 32 patients were evaluable for response - complete remission 9.1% (n = 3), partial remission 45.5% (n = 15), no change 27.3% (n = 9), progressive disease 15.1% (n = 5). Median overall survival time was 10.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 8.7-11.6], and median progression-free survival time was 7.6 months (95% CI: 4.4-10.9). The worst toxicities (%) observed were (CTC-NCI 1/2/3): leukopenia 45.5/18.2/6.1, thrombocytopenia 33.3/9.1/6.1, vomitus 24.2/9.1/0, diarrhea 36.4/6.1/3.0, stomatitis 18.2/9.1/0, hand-foot syndrome 12.1/0/0. Two patients developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose 5-FU/FA/MMC is an effective and well-tolerated outpatient regimen for AGC (objective response rate 54.6%). It may serve as an alternative to cisplatin-containing regimens; however, it has to be considered that possibly HUS may occur.
BACKGROUND: The activity of the combination of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin was tested in a Phase II study of patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma. METHODS: The combination of carboplatin (area under the concentration curve [AUC], 5) and liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil; starting dose, 40 mg/m(2)) was administered intravenously every 28 days to 37 patients with recurrent squamous cell cervical carcinoma to determine antitumor activity and toxicity profile. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were assessable for response, and 35 patients were assessable for toxicity. The overall response rate was 38%, the median time to response was 10 weeks, the median duration of response was 26 weeks, and the median survival was 37 weeks. The main toxic effect was myelosuppression, with Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in 16 patients, anemia in 12 patients, thrombocytopenia in 11 patients, and neutropenic fever in 3 patients. Four patients had five infusion-related reactions during the infusion of liposomal doxorubicin, leading to treatment discontinuation in three patients. Grade > or = 2 nonhematologic toxicity included nausea in 17 patients, emesis in 14 patients, fatigue in 9 patients, mucositis and/or stomatitis in 8 patients, constipation in 6 patients, weight loss in 5 patients, hand-foot syndrome in 2 patients, and skin reactions in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin has modest activity in patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma.
BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker, losartan, and its potential in slowing down renal disease progression in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy. METHODS: Six-month-old female SHR were randomly selected in six groups. Two control groups (SH(6), SH(12)) received vehicle. Groups ADR(6), ADR+LOS(6) and ADR(12), and ADR+LOS(12) received ADR (2 mg/kg/b.w. i.v.) twice in a 3-week interval. Group ADR+LOS(6) received losartan (10 mg/kg/b.w./day by gavages) for 6 weeks and group ADR+LOS(12) for 12 weeks after second injection of ADR. Animals were killed after 6 or 12 weeks, respectively. Haemodynamic measurements were performed on anaesthetized animals, blood and urine samples were taken for biochemical analysis and the left kidney was processed for morphological studies. RESULTS: Short-term losartan treatment, besides antihypertensive effect, improved glomerular filtration rate and ameliorated glomerulosclerosis resulting in decreased proteinuria. Prolonged treatment with losartan showed further reduction of glomerulosclerosis associated with reduced progression of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, thus preventing heavy proteinuria and chronic renal failure. Losartan reduced uraemia and increased urea clearance in advanced ADR nephropathy in SHR. Histological examination showed that losartan could prevent tubular atrophy, interstitial infiltration and fibrosis in ADR nephropathy. CONCLUSION: Losartan reduces the rate of progression of ADR-induced focal segmental glomerulosclerosis to end-stage renal disease in SHR.
BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of RAPA conversion in patients undergoing cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tac) toxicity. METHODS: Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose rapamycin (RAPA) (5 mg/day) 0 to 204 months posttransplant. Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses. The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity (12), acute CsA or Tac toxicity (3), severe facial dysmorphism (2), posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in remission (2), and hepatotoxicity in 1. Follow-up is 7 to 24 months. RESULTS: In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine [233+/-34 to 210+/-56 micromol/liter (P<0.05) at 6 months]. Facial dysmorphism improved in two patients. No relapse of PTLD was observed. Five patients developed pneumonia (two Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal PTLD lung infiltrate) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans. There were no deaths. RAPA was discontinued in four patients, because of pneumonia in two, PTLD in one, and oral aphtous ulcers in one. RAPA levels were high (>15 ng/ml) in 7 of 13 (54%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: RAPA conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable CsA withdrawal. However, when converting patients to RAPA drug levels should be monitored to avoid over-immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis should be given.
BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic. Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) has dramatically improved success rates. Recently, however, we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure (CRF) in OLTX patients. METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n=834). Our prospectively collected database was the source of information. Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no CRF or ESRD, n=748; CRF, sustained serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, n=41; and ESRD, n=45. Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, type of ESRD therapy, and survival from onset of ESRD. RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (CRF 8.6% and ESRD 9.5%). Compared with control patients, CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum creatinine. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28.2% compared with 54.6% in the control group. Patients developing ESRD had a 6-year survival after onset of ESRD of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71.4% for the patients developing ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post-OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate. The development of ESRD decreases survival, particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only. Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome. However, an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of CRF or ESRD. New strategies for long-term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication.
BACKGROUND: The effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and related dioxin-like chemicals are mediated through binding-dependent activation of the cytosolic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The human AHR is a low-affinity receptor relative to most rodents, but some reports suggest that there may be individuals with polymorphic high-affinity receptors, thereby possibly increasing the sensitivity to dioxins in such people. METHODS: Although no polymorphisms have been reported in the ligand binding region of the AHR in the over 100 reported sequences, we sequenced 108 additional human AHR genes in an effort to further identify single single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the open reading frames of the AHR locus. The DNA was sequenced from six ethnic populations that included Japanese, Chinese, European/Caucasian, African-American, South East Asian, and Hispanic. RESULTS: Six exonic SNPs were identified; four had been described as previously reported and two seem to be novel. Four of the SNPs identified lead to amino acid changes in the AHR protein and two of the SNPs lead to synonymous substitutions. An additional four SNPs have been reported elsewhere that were not identified in the current analysis. With these new sequences, more than 200 human AHR gene sequences have been analyzed for SNPs. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a very limited presence of polymorphisms in the core ligand binding region of the human AHR. Other regions, such as the transactivation domain, seem to be slightly more polymorphic in the human population and the impact on functionality should be further examined.
BACKGROUND: The interruption of oral anticoagulant (OAC) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves, mainly before noncardiac surgery, non-surgical interventions, and pregnancy. Unfractionated heparin (UH) is currently the substitute for selected patients. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) offers theoretical advantages over UH, but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to UH in patients with prosthetic valves. HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of LMWH in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice. METHODS: For this paper, the current medical literature on LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed. RESULTS: There were eight series and six case reports. None of the studies was randomized, and only one was prospective. Data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete. After excluding case reports, the following groups were constructed: (a) short-term administration, after valve insertion (n = 212); (b) short-term, perioperative (noncardiac)/periprocedural (n = 114); (c) long-term, due to intolerance to OAC (n = 16); (d) long-term, in pregnancy (n = 10). The incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0.9% for all the studies and 0.5, 0, 20, and 0% in groups a, b, c, and d, respectively; for hemorrhage, the overall rate was 3.4% (3.8, 2.6, 10, and 0% for the respective groups). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mechanical heart valves, short-term LMWH therapy compares favorably with UH. Data on mid- and long-term LMWH administration in these patients are sparse. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves.
BACKGROUND: The involvement of water-soluble carotenoids, crocins, as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L. extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed. In the present study, the effect of crocins on sporadic Alzheimer's disease induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) streptozocin (STZ) in male rats was investigated. METHODS: Male adult Wistar rats (n = 90 and 260-290 g) were divided into 1, control; 2 and 3, crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg); 4, STZ; 5 and 6, STZ + crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg) groups. In Alzheimer's disease groups, rats were injected with STZ-icv bilaterally (3 mg/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar STZ-icv application was repeated. In STZ + crocin animal groups, crocin was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p., one day pre-surgery and continued for three weeks. Prescription of crocin in each dose was repeated once for two days. However, the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm, and for spatial cognition evaluation, Y-maze task was used. RESULTS: It was found out that crocin (30 mg/kg)-treated STZ-injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y-maze than vehicle-treated STZ-injected rats. In addition, crocin in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated STZ-injected group in passive avoidance test. CONCLUSION: Therefore, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of crocin (30 mg/kg) in antagonizing the cognitive deficits caused by STZ-icv in rats and its potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying heart failure induced by adriamycin are very complicated and still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of heart failure induced by adriamycin, so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for heart failure. METHODS: 3-methyladenine (3MA), a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a heart failure model of rats induced by adriamycin. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat hearts and randomly divided into controls, an adriamycin-treated group, and a 3MA plus adriamycin-treated group. We then examined the morphology, expression of beclin 1 gene, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and Na+-K+ ATPase activity in vivo. We also assessed cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes. In addition, we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene, beclin 1 using RT-PCR and Western blotting in an animal model. RESULTS: 3MA significantly improved cardiac function and reduced mitochondrial injury. Furthermore, adriamycin induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles, and 3MA strongly downregulated the expression of beclin 1 in adriamycin-induced failing heart and inhibited the formation of autophagic vacuoles. CONCLUSION: Autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure in rats induced by adriamycin. Mitochondrial injury may be involved in the progression of heart failure caused by adriamycin via the autophagy pathway.
BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin's advantages (CBDCA) over cisplatin (CDDP) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects. However, the use of CBDCA higher-intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two different schedules of CBDCA administration (10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg i.p. twice a week for nine times) were evaluated in Wistar rats. Neurotoxicity was assessed for behavioral (tail-flick test), neurophysiological (nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve), morphological, morphometrical and analytical effects. RESULTS: CBDCA administration induced dose-dependent peripheral neurotoxicity. Pain perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired, particularly after the high-dose treatment. The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and, to a lesser extent, satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by CDDP, mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons. Moreover, significant amounts of platinum were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after CBDCA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism. This model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of CBDCA on the peripheral nervous system.
BACKGROUND: The optimal dosing regimens of lipid emulsion, epinephrine, or both are not yet determined in neonates in cases of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). METHODS: Newborn piglets received levobupivacaine until cardiovascular collapse occurred. Standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started and electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored for ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, or QRS prolongation. Piglets were then randomly allocated to four groups: control (saline), Intralipid( ) alone, epinephrine alone, or a combination of Intralipd plus epinephrine. Resuscitation continued for 30 min or until there was a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) accompanied by a mean arterial pressure at or superior to the baseline pressure and normal sinus rhythm for a period of 30 min. RESULTS: ROSC was achieved in only one of the control piglets compared with most of the treated piglets. Mortality was not significantly different between the three treatment groups, but was significantly lower in all the treatment groups compared with control. The number of ECG abnormalities was zero in the Intralipid only group, but 14 and 17, respectively, in the epinephrine and epinephrine plus lipid groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lipid emulsion with or without epinephrine, or epinephrine alone were equally effective in achieving a return to spontaneous circulation in this model of LAST. Epinephrine alone or in combination with lipid was associated with an increased number of ECG abnormalities compared with lipid emulsion alone.
BACKGROUND: The phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene was reported as a susceptibility gene to stroke. The genetic effect might be attributed to its role in modulating the atherogenic process in the carotid arteries. Using carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque index as phenotypes, the present study sought to determine the influence of this gene on subclinical atherosclerosis. METHODS: Carotid ultrasonography was performed on 1013 stroke-free subjects who participated in the health screening programs (age 52.6 +/- 12.2; 47.6% men). Genotype distribution was compared among the high-risk (plaque index > or = 4), low-risk (index = 1-3), and reference (index = 0) groups. We analyzed continuous IMT data and further dichotomized IMT data using mean plus one standard deviation as the cutoff level. Because the plaque prevalence and IMT values displayed a notable difference between men and women, we carried out sex-specific analyses in addition to analyzing the overall data. Rs702553 at the PDE4D gene was selected because it conferred a risk for young stroke in our previous report. Previous young stroke data (190 cases and 211 controls) with an additional 532 control subjects without ultrasonic data were shown as a cross-validation for the genetic effect. RESULTS: In the overall analyses, the rare homozygote of rs702553 led to an OR of 3.1 (p = 0.034) for a plaque index > or = 4. When subjects were stratified by sex, the genetic effect was only evident in men but not in women. Comparing male subjects with plaque index > or = 4 and those with plaque index = 0, the TT genotype was over-represented (27.6% vs. 13.4%, p = 0.008). For dichotomized IMT data in men, the TT genotype had an OR of 2.1 (p = 0.032) for a thicker IMT at the common carotid artery compared with the (AA + AT) genotypes. In women, neither IMT nor plaque index was associated with rs702553. Similarly, SNP rs702553 was only significant in young stroke men (OR = 1.8, p = 0.025) but not in women (p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates a sex-differential effect of PDE4D on IMT, plaque index and stroke, which highlights its influence on various aspects of atherogenesis.
BACKGROUND: The possible role of alcohol in the development of hepatotoxicity associated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol (acetaminophen) is currently debated. CASE REPORT: We describe 2 patients who were regular consumers of alcohol and who developed liver failure within 3-5 days after hospitalization and stopping alcohol consumption while being treated with 4 g paracetamol/day. A paracetamol serum level obtained in one of these patients was not in the toxic range. Possible risk factors for the development of hepatotoxicity in patients treated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol are discussed. CONCLUSION: In patients with risk factors, e.g. regular consumption of alcohol, liver failure is possible when therapeutic doses are ingested. We propose that the paracetamol dose should not exceed 2 g/day in such patients and that their liver function should be monitored closely while being treated with paracetamol.
BACKGROUND: The prognosis for transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver failure remains unknown. AIM: To examine whether paracetamol-induced acute liver failure increases long-term mortality. METHODS: We followed up all transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver injury, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984-2004. We compared age-specific mortality rates from 1 year post-discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an acute liver failure and those in whom it did not. RESULTS: We included 641 patients. On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol-induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups. These observations speak against long-term effects of acute liver failure. More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute liver failure. CONCLUSIONS: Paracetamol-induced acute liver failure did not affect long-term mortality. Clinical follow-up may be justified by the cause of the liver failure, but not by the liver failure itself.
BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare surgical conditions, including the amount of intraoperative bleeding as well as intraoperative blood pressure, during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) using flexible reinforced laryngeal mask airway (FRLMA) versus endotracheal tube (ETT) in maintaining controlled hypotension anesthesia induced by propofol-remifentanil total i.v. anesthesia (TIVA). METHODS: Sixty normotensive American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II adult patients undergoing FESS under controlled hypotension anesthesia caused by propofol-remifentanil-TIVA were randomly assigned into two groups: group I, FRLMA; group II, ETT. Hemorrhage was measured and the visibility of the operative field was evaluated according to a six-point scale. RESULTS: Controlled hypotension was achieved within a shorter period using laryngeal mask using lower rates of remifentanil infusion and lower total dose of remifentanil. CONCLUSION: In summary, our results indicate that airway management using FRLMA during controlled hypotension anesthesia provided better surgical conditions in terms of quality of operative field and blood loss and allowed for convenient induced hypotension with low doses of remifentanil during TIVA in patients undergoing FESS.
BACKGROUND: The role of germline and somatic SMARCB1 gene mutations in malignant rhabdoid tumour (MRT) predisposition is well known. Germline SMARCB1 mutations have also recently been identified in a subset of individuals with schwannomatosis. Surprisingly, MRT predisposition and schwannomatosis have never been reported to co-occur in a family. The correlation between genotype and phenotype for mutations in SMARCB1 has not been determined. RESULTS: We have identified a germline 2631 bp duplication that includes exon 6 of SMARCB1 in a unique family with a four generation history of MRT predisposition and schwannomatosis. This duplication segregates with disease in individuals affected with both conditions, linking MRT predisposition and schwannomatosis as components of the same syndrome in this family. CONCLUSION: The unique combination of tumours that result from the duplication described in this report may provide important clues about the mechanisms that influence the phenotype associated with a given SMARCB1 mutation.
BACKGROUND: The septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epileptogenesis, and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents, but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement in alcohol withdrawal severity. Thus, the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal severity. METHODS: Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol-na ve Withdrawal Seizure-Prone (WSP) and-Resistant (WSR) mice. Animals were administered nicotine, carbachol, or neostigmine via timed tail vein infusion, and the latencies to onset of tremor and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose. We also used microdialysis to measure basal and potassium-stimulated acetylcholine (ACh) release in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Potassium was applied by reverse dialysis twice, separated by 75 min. Hippocampal ACh also was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions. RESULTS: Sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine, carbachol, and neostigmine were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice. In microdialysis experiments, the lines did not differ in basal release of ACh, and 50 mM KCl increased ACh output in both lines of mice. However, the increase in release of ACh produced by the first application of KCl was 2-fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice. When hippocampal ACh was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions, extracellular ACh was significantly elevated (192%) in WSP mice, but was nonsignificantly elevated (59%) in WSR mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal. Specifically, WSP mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants compared with WSR because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons.
BACKGROUND: The use of appetite suppressants in Europe has been associated with the development of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). Recently, fenfluramine appetite suppressants became widely used in the United States but were withdrawn in September 1997 because of concerns over adverse effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study on patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 12 large referral centers in North America. Data collected on patients seen from September 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997, included the cause of the pulmonary hypertension and its severity. Patients with no identifiable cause of pulmonary hypertension were classed as PPH. A history of drug exposure also was taken with special attention on the use of antidepressants, anorexigens, and amphetamines. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-nine patients were studied, 205 with PPH and 374 with pulmonary hypertension from other causes (secondary pulmonary hypertension [SPH]). The use of anorexigens was common in both groups. However, of the medications surveyed, only the fenfluramines had a significant preferential association with PPH as compared with SPH (adjusted odds ratio for use > 6 months, 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 32.4). The association was stronger with longer duration of use when compared to shorter duration of use and was more pronounced in recent users than in remote users. An unexpectedly high (11.4%) number of patients with SPH had used anorexigens. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of the association with PPH, the increase of association with increasing duration of use, and the specificity for fenfluramines are consistent with previous studies indicating that fenfluramines are causally related to PPH. The high prevalence of anorexigen use in patients with SPH also raises the possibility that these drugs precipitate pulmonary hypertension in patients with underlying conditions associated with SPH.
BACKGROUND: The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in nephropathy. Whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, iohexol. The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography. The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the creatinine concentration during the three days after angiography. Other end points were an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7. RESULTS: The creatinine concentration increased significantly less in patients who received iodixanol. From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with iohexol, -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). No patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the iohexol group (15 percent) did. The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.003; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the iohexol group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]). CONCLUSIONS: Nephropathy induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when iodixanol is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium.
BACKGROUND: The widespread use of benzodiazepines has led to increasing recognition of their unwanted effects. The efficacy of alprazolam and placebo in panic disorder with agoraphobia, and the side-effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured. METHOD: In London and Toronto 154 patients who met DSM-III criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomised to alprazolam or placebo. Subjects in each drug group also received either exposure or relaxation. Treatment was from weeks 0 to 8 and was then tapered from weeks 8 to 16. RESULTS: Mean alprazolam dose was 5 mg daily. Compared with placebo subjects, alprazolam patients developed more adverse reactions (21% v. 0%) of depression, enuresis, disinhibition and aggression; and more side-effects, particularly sedation, irritability, impaired memory, weight loss and ataxia. Side-effects tended to diminish during treatment but remained significant at week 8. Despite this, the drop-out rate was low. CONCLUSIONS: Alprazolam caused side-effects and adverse effects during treatment but many patients were willing to accept these.
BACKGROUND: There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels. However, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure. OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to answer these questions, using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer, a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning. RESULTS: Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb-exposed children. Succimer treatment of the Pb-exposed rats significantly improved learning, attention, and arousal regulation, although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit. In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen. CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure. These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children. However, they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals.
BACKGROUND: There recently has been a resurgence in the utilization of ketamine, a unique anesthetic, for emergency-department procedures requiring sedation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for sedation in the treatment of children's fractures in the emergency department. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen children (average age, 5.3 years; range, twelve months to ten years and ten months) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated fracture or dislocation in the emergency department at a level-I trauma center were prospectively evaluated. Ketamine hydrochloride was administered intravenously (at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in ninety-nine of the patients and intramuscularly (at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in the other fifteen. A board-certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic, and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse. Any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS). RESULTS: The average time from intravenous administration of ketamine to manipulation of the fracture or dislocation was one minute and thirty-six seconds (range, twenty seconds to five minutes), and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty-two seconds (range, sixty seconds to fifteen minutes). The average score according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale was 6.4 points (range, 5 to 10 points), reflecting minimal or no pain during fracture reduction. Adequate fracture reduction was obtained in 111 of the children. Ninety-nine percent (sixty-eight) of the sixty-nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation. Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients. Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable. Minor side effects included nausea (thirteen patients), emesis (eight of the thirteen patients with nausea), clumsiness (evident as ataxic movements in ten patients), and dysphoric reaction (one patient). No long-term sequelae were noted, and no patients had hallucinations or nightmares. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine reliably, safely, and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department at our institution. Ketamine should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department, where proper one-on-one monitoring is used and board-certified physicians skilled in airway management are directly involved in the care of the patient.
BACKGROUND: This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization (EAD) in producing a trigger to initiate torsade de pointes (TdP) with QT prolongation induced by dl-sotalol and azimilide. The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of TdP was also evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium, midmyocardium, and endocardium were recorded simultaneously, together with a transmural ECG, in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations. dl-Sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration (APD) in M cells dose-dependently (1 to 100 micromol/L), leading to QT prolongation and an increase in TDR. Azimilide, however, significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 micromol/L but shortened them at 30 micromol/L. Unlike dl-sotalol, azimilide (>3 micromol/L) increased epicardial APD markedly, causing a diminished TDR. Although both dl-sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles, they produced frequent EADs in rabbits, in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen. An increase in TDR by dl-sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles. Of note, although azimilide (3 to 10 micromol/L) increased APD more than dl-sotalol, its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally, probably because of a diminished TDR. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of TdP under QT prolongation.
BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia in patients with end-stage liver disease is a common disorder caused mainly by portal hypertension, low levels of thrombopoetin, and endotoxemia. The impact of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) as a cause of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation is not yet understood, with few literature citations reporting contradictory results. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the perioperative course of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation and determine the occurrence of clinical HIT type II. METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 205 consecutive adult patients who underwent full-size liver transplantation between January 2006 and December 2010 due to end-stage or malignant liver disease. Preoperative platelet count, postoperative course of platelets, and clinical signs of HIT type II were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 155 (75.6%) of 205 patients had thrombocytopenia before transplantation, significantly influenced by Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score and liver cirrhosis. The platelet count exceeded 100,000/uL in most of the patients (n = 193) at a medium of 7 d. Regarding HIT II, there were four (1.95%) patients with a background of HIT type II. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HIT in patients with end-stage hepatic failure is, with about 1.95%, rare. For further reduction of HIT type II, the use of intravenous heparin should be avoided and the prophylactic anticoagulation should be performed with low-molecular-weight heparin after normalization of platelet count.
BACKGROUND: To determine the onset and extent of combined androgen blockade (CAB)-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients without bone involvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with biopsy-proven prostatic adenocarcinoma [26 with stage C (T3N0M0) and 16 with stage D1 (T3N1M0)] were included in this study. All patients received CAB [leuprolide acetate (LHRH-A) 3.75 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days plus 250 mg flutamide, tid, per Os] and were evaluated for anemia by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals (1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB). Hb, PSA and Testosterone measurements were recorded. Patients with stage D2-3 disease, abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study. The duration of the study was six months. RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14.2 g/dl to 14.0 g/dl, 13.5 g/dl, 13.2 g/dl and 12.7 g/dl at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB, respectively. Severe and clinically evident anemia of Hb < 11 g/dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients (14.3%). This CAB-induced anemia was normochromic and normocytic. At six months post-CAB, patients with severe anemia had a Hb mean value of 10.2 +/- 0.1 g/dl (X +/- SE), whereas the other patients had mild anemia with Hb mean value of 13.2 +/- 0.17 (X +/- SE). The development of severe anemia at 6 months post-CAB was predictable by the reduction of Hb baseline value of more than 2.5 g/dl after 3 months of CAB (p = 0.01). The development of severe CAB-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients did not correlate with T baseline values (T < 3 ng/ml versus T > or = 3 ng/ml), with age (< 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs), and clinical stage (stage C versus stage D1). Severe and clinically evident anemia was easily corrected by subcutaneous injections (3 times/week for 1 month) of recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO-beta). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that rHuEPO-beta correctable CAB-induced anemia occurs in 14.3% of prostate cancer patients after 6 months of therapy.
BACKGROUND: To review evidence-based treatment options in patients with cerebral edema complicating fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) and discuss the potential applications of hypothermia. METHOD: Case-based observations from a medical intensive care unit (MICU) in a tertiary care facility in a 27-year-old female with FHF from acetaminophen and resultant cerebral edema. RESULTS: Our patient was admitted to the MICU after being found unresponsive with presumed toxicity from acetaminophen which was ingested over a 2-day period. The patient had depressed of mental status lasting at least 24 h prior to admission. Initial evaluation confirmed FHF from acetaminophen and cerebral edema. The patient was treated with hyperosmolar therapy, hyperventilation, sedation, and chemical paralysis. Her intracranial pressure remained elevated despite maximal medical therapy. We then initiated therapeutic hypothermia which was continued for 5 days. At re-warming, patient had resolution of her cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension. At discharge, she had complete recovery of neurological and hepatic functions. CONCLUSION: In patients with FHF and cerebral edema from acetaminophen overdose, prolonged therapeutic hypothermia could potentially be used as a life saving therapy and a bridge to hepatic and neurological recovery. A clinical trial of hypothermia in patients with this condition is warranted.
BACKGROUND: Treatment of breast cancer with the antiestrogen tamoxifen is effective in approximately one half of the patients with estrogen receptor-positive disease, but tumors recur frequently because of the development of metastases that are resistant to tamoxifen. We have previously shown that mutagenesis of human estrogen-dependent ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells by insertion of a defective retrovirus genome caused the cells to become antiestrogen resistant. In this study, we isolated and characterized the crucial gene at the breast cancer antiestrogen resistance 1 (BCAR1) locus. METHODS/RESULTS: Transfer of the BCAR1 locus from retrovirus-mutated, antiestrogen-resistant cells to estrogen-dependent ZR-75-1 cells by cell fusion conferred an antiestrogen-resistant phenotype on the recipient cells. The complete coding sequence of BCAR1 was isolated by use of exon-trapping and complementary DNA (cDNA) library screening. Sequence analysis of human BCAR1 cDNA predicted a protein of 870 amino acids that was strongly homologous to rat p130Cas-adapter protein. Genomic analysis revealed that BCAR1 consists of seven exons and is located at chromosome 16q23.1. BCAR1 transcripts were detected in multiple human tissues and were similar in size to transcripts produced by retrovirus-mutated ZR-75-1 cells. Transfection of BCAR1 cDNA into ZR-75-1 cells again resulted in sustained cell proliferation in the presence of antiestrogens, confirming that BCAR1 was the responsible gene in the locus. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of the BCAR1 gene confers antiestrogen resistance on human ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. Overexpression of BCAR1 in retrovirus-mutated cells appears to result from activation of the gene's promoter. The isolation and characterization of this gene open new avenues to elucidating mechanisms by which the growth of human breast cancer becomes independent of estrogen.
BACKGROUND: Treatment options are scarce in pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. RAD001, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), has shown phase I efficacy in NSCLC. METHODS: Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC patients, with two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens, one platinum based (stratum 1) or both chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (stratum 2), received RAD001 10 mg/day until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objective was overall response rate (ORR). Analyses of markers associated with the mTOR pathway were carried out on archival tumor from a subgroup using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and direct mutation sequencing. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled, 42 in stratum 1 and 43 in stratum. ORR was 4.7% (7.1% stratum 1; 2.3% stratum 2). Overall disease control rate was 47.1%. Median progression-free survivals (PFSs) were 2.6 (stratum 1) and 2.7 months (stratum 2). Common > or =grade 3 events were fatigue, dyspnea, stomatitis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Pneumonitis, probably or possibly related, mainly grade 1/2, occurred in 25%. Cox regression analysis of IHC scores found that only phospho AKT (pAKT) was a significant independent predictor of worse PFS. CONCLUSIONS: RAD001 10 mg/day was well tolerated, showing modest clinical activity in pretreated NSCLC. Evaluation of RAD001 plus standard therapy for metastatic NSCLC continues.
BACKGROUND: Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials, primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents, especially at the recommended doses. The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high- compared with low-dose lisinopril in CHF. METHODS: The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium-dose lisinopril (12.5 or 15.0 mg once daily [OD]) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high- (35.0 or 32.5 mg OD) or low-dose (5.0 or 2.5 mg OD) groups. Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0.30 (n = 3164) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months. We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment, with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction. RESULTS: Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor, doses in only 4.2% could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension (2.0%) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia (2.3%). Doses in more than 90% of randomized patients in the high- and low-dose groups were titrated to their assigned target, and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study. Withdrawals occurred in 27.1% of the high- and 30.7% of the low-dose groups. Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance (blood pressure, <120 mm Hg; creatinine, > or =132.6 micromol/L [> or =1.5 mg/dL]; age, > or =70 years; and patients with diabetes) generally tolerated the high-dose strategy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with CHF can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses, and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted.
BACKGROUND: Unfractionated heparin sodium (UFH) or low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transplantation. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse immune-mediated reaction to heparin, resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50%. The frequencies of HIT after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4/heparin-reactive antibody (HIT antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation. We started LMWH (25 IU/kg/h) on postoperative day (POD) 1, switching to UFH (5000 U/d) on POD 2 or 3. The dose of UFH was changed according to the activated clotting time level. HIT antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14. Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks. RESULTS: The average platelet counts preoperatively, and on POD 7, 14, and 21 were 65, 88, 149, and 169 x 10(9)/L, respectively. Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were HIT antibody-negative and their platelet counts were stable. In 2 other patients, the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10(9)/L on POD 4 to 65 x 10(9)/L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10(9)/L on POD 7 to 33 x 10(9)/L on POD 9, respectively. The heparin-induced platelet aggregation test was negative in these patients. The percentage of HIT antibody-positive patients was 0.5% preoperatively, 5.6% on POD 7, and 5.6% on POD 14. None of the subjects/patients developed UFH-related HIT. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the occurrence of HIT after liver transplantation was uncommon.
BACKGROUND: Vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia-induced hypotension. We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) following anesthesia-induced hypotension. METHODS: Following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl (0.15 mg kg(-1)) and propofol (2.0 mg kg(-1)), 13 patients received phenylephrine (0.1 mg iv) and 12 patients received ephedrine (10 mg iv) to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP). Heart rate (HR), MAP, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) were registered. RESULTS: Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP, HR, SV, and CO concomitant with an elevation in S(c)O(2). After administration of phenylephrine, MAP increased (51 +/- 12 to 81 +/- 13 mmHg; P < 0.001; mean +/- SD). However, a 14% (from 70 +/- 8% to 60 +/- 7%) reduction in S(c)O(2) (P < 0.05) followed with no change in CO (3.7 +/- 1.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.9 l min(-1)). The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP (53 +/- 9 to 79 +/- 8 mmHg; P < 0.001), restored CO (3.2 +/- 1.2 to 5.0 +/- 1.3 l min(-1)), and preserved S(c)O(2). CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of phenylephrine to correct hypotension induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on S(c)O(2) while ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in CO.
BACKGROUND: Vitamin C acts as a potent antioxidant; however, it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro. These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin C in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease. DESIGN: We studied the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease (n = 281), coronary artery disease (n = 175), and stroke (n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline. Diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y. RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, type of diabetes medication used, duration of diabetes, and intakes of folate, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (P for trend < 0.01) across quintiles of total vitamin C intake from food and supplements. Adjusted relative risks of coronary artery disease were 1.0, 0.81, 0.99, 1.26, and 1.91 (P for trend = 0.01) and of stroke were 1.0, 0.52, 1.23, 2.22, and 2.57 (P for trend < 0.01). When dietary and supplemental vitamin C were analyzed separately, only supplemental vitamin C showed a positive association with mortality endpoints. Vitamin C intake was unrelated to mortality from cardiovascular disease in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline. CONCLUSION: A high vitamin C intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in postmenopausal women with diabetes.
BACKGROUND: We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus (FK506) for more than 1 year. METHODS: Twenty-six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated. Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent (nonepisode biopsy) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy (episode biopsy). RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (AR; n = 4), chronic rejection (CR; n=5), AR+CR (n =4), recurrent IgA nephropathy (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic FK506 nephropathy (n = 9), and mild-type FK506 nephropathy (n = 11). Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy, respectively. Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (4 biopsies) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis (11 biopsies). The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic FK506-nephropathy group (P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that chronic FK506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function.
BACKGROUND: We compared the efficacy and safety of olanzapine vs placebo for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. METHODS: Four-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel study. A total of 115 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic or mixed, were randomized to olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 55), or placebo (n = 60). The primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) total score. Response and euthymia were defined, a priori, as at least a 50% improvement from baseline to end point and as a score of no less than 12 at end point in the Y-MRS total score, respectively. Safety was assessed using adverse events, Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS) rating scales, laboratory values, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and weight change. RESULTS: Olanzapine-treated patients demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD) improvement in Y-MRS total score than placebo-treated patients (-14.8 +/- 12.5 and -8.1 +/- 12.7, respectively; P<.001), which was evident at the first postbaseline observation 1 week after randomization and was maintained throughout the study (last observation carried forward). Olanzapine-treated patients demonstrated a higher rate of response (65% vs 43%, respectively; P =.02) and euthymia (61% vs 36%, respectively; P =. 01) than placebo-treated patients. There were no statistically significant differences in EPSs between groups. However, olanzapine-treated patients had a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD) weight gain than placebo-treated patients (2.1 +/- 2.8 vs 0.45 +/- 2.3 kg, respectively) and also experienced more treatment-emergent somnolence (21 patients [38.2%] vs 5 [8.3% ], respectively). CONCLUSION: Olanzapine demonstrated greater efficacy than placebo in the treatment of acute bipolar mania and was generally well tolerated.
BACKGROUND: We report on the manifestation of a levetiracetam (LEV)-induced encephalopathy. FINDINGS: A 28-year-old man suffering from idiopathic epilepsy with generalized seizures was treated with LEV (3000 mg) added to valproate (VPA) (2000 mg). Frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures increased from one per 6 months to two per month. Neuropsychological testing showed impaired word fluency, psychomotor speed and working memory. The interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a generalized slowing to 5 per second theta rhythms with bilateral generalized high-amplitude discharges. OUTCOME: Following discontinuation of LEV, EEG and neuropsychological findings improved and seizure frequency decreased.
BACKGROUND: While the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus may be increasing in patients with schizophrenia treated with certain atypical antipsychotic agents, it remains unclear whether atypical agents are directly affecting glucose metabolism or simply increasing known risk factors for diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To study the 2 drugs most clearly implicated (clozapine and olanzapine) and risperidone using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design in stable, treated patients with schizophrenia evaluated using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and the Bergman minimal model analysis. SETTING: Subjects were recruited from an urban community mental health clinic and were studied at a general clinical research center. Patients Fifty subjects signed informed consent and 41 underwent the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Thirty-six nonobese subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, matched by body mass index and treated with either clozapine, olanzapine, or risperidone, were included in the analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting plasma glucose and fasting serum insulin levels, insulin sensitivity index, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and glucose effectiveness. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD duration of treatment with the identified atypical antipsychotic agent was 68.3 +/- 28.9 months (clozapine), 29.5 +/- 17.5 months (olanzapine), and 40.9 +/- 33.7 (risperidone). Fasting serum insulin concentrations differed among groups (F(33) = 3.35; P = .047) (clozapine>olanzapine>risperidone) with significant differences between clozapine and risperidone (t(33) = 2.32; P = .03) and olanzapine and risperidone (t(33) = 2.15; P = .04). There was a significant difference in insulin sensitivity index among groups (F(33) = 10.66; P<.001) (clozapine<olanzapine<risperidone), with subjects who received clozapine and olanzapine exhibiting significant insulin resistance compared with subjects who were treated with risperidone (clozapine vs risperidone, t(33) = -4.29; P<.001; olanzapine vs risperidone, t(33) = -3.62; P = .001 [P<.001]). The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance also differed significantly among groups (F(33) = 4.92; P = .01) (clozapine>olanzapine>risperidone) (clozapine vs risperidone, t(33) = 2.94; P = .006; olanzapine vs risperidone, t(33) = 2.42; P = .02). There was a significant difference among groups in glucose effectiveness (F(30) = 4.18; P = .02) (clozapine<olanzapine<risperidone) with significant differences between clozapine and risperidone (t(30) = -2.59; P = .02) and olanzapine and risperidone (t(30) = -2.34, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Both nonobese clozapine- and olanzapine-treated groups displayed significant insulin resistance and impairment of glucose effectiveness compared with risperidone-treated subjects. Patients taking clozapine and olanzapine must be examined for insulin resistance and its consequences.
BACKGROUND: patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) often receive succinylcholine as part of the anesthetic procedure. The duration of action may be prolonged in patients with genetic variants of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE), the most common being the K- and the A-variants. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical significance of genetic variants in butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE) in patients with a suspected prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine after ECT. METHODS: a total of 13 patients were referred to the Danish Cholinesterase Research Unit after ECT during 38 months. We determined the BChE activity and the BCHE genotype using molecular genetic methods, the duration of apnea, time to sufficient spontaneous ventilation and whether neuromuscular monitoring was used. The duration of apnea was compared with published data on normal subjects. RESULTS: in 11 patients, mutations were found in the BCHE gene, the K-variant being the most frequent. The duration of apnea was 5-15 min compared with 3-5.3 min from the literature. Severe distress was noted in the recovery phase in two patients. Neuromuscular monitoring was used in two patients. CONCLUSION: eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine had mutations in BCHE, indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of apnea. We recommend objective neuromuscular monitoring during the first ECT.

BRCA1 R841W: a strong candidate for a common mutation with moderate phenotype.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for most cases of familial, early onset breast and/or ovarian cancer and encode products that each interact with hRAD51. Results presented here show that BRCA1 and BRCA2 coexist in a biochemical complex and colocalize in subnuclear foci in somatic cells and on the axial elements of developing synaptonemal complexes. Like BRCA1 and RAD51, BRCA2 relocates to PCNA + replication sites following exposure of S phase cells to hydroxyurea or UV irradiation. Thus, BRCA1 and BRCA2 participate, together, in a pathway (s) associated with the activation of double-strand break repair and/or homologous recombination. Dysfunction of this pathway may be a general phenomenon in the majority of cases of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer..
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two major identified causes of inherited breast cancer, with mutations in either gene conferring up to 80-90% lifetime risk of breast cancer in carrier females. Mutations in BRCA1 account for approximately 45% of familial breast cancer and 90% of inherited breast/ovarian cancer, whereas mutations in BRCA2 account for a comparable percentage of inherited breast cancer cases. Over 85 distinct BRCA1 mutations and a growing list of BRCA2 mutations have been identified, with the majority resulting in protein truncation. A specific BRCA1 mutation, 185delAG, has a reported increased carrier frequency of approximately 0. 9% in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but is also found in rare non-Jewish patients with a different haplotype. The 6174delT mutation in BRCA2 was recently identified as a frequent mutation in 8 out of 107 Ashkenazi Jewish women diagnosed with breast cancer by age 50 (ref. 8), as well as in three Ashkenazi male breast cancer patients. We have conducted a large-scale population study to investigate the prevalence of specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who were unselected for breast cancer. BRCA1 mutation screening on approximately 3, 000 Ashkenazi Jewish samples determined a carrier frequency of 1. 09% for the 185delAG mutation and 0. 13% for the 5382insC mutation. BRCA2 analysis on 3, 085 individuals from the same population showed a carrier frequency of 1. 52% for the 6174delT mutation. This expanded population-based study confirms that the BRCA1 185delAG mutation and the BRCA2 6174delT mutation constitute the two most frequent mutation alleles predisposing to hereditary breast cancer among the Ashkenazim, and suggests a relatively lower penetrance for the 6174delT mutation in BRCA2
BRCA1 encodes a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancers. Here, it is shown that BRCA1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with hRad50, which forms a complex with hMre11 and p95/nibrin. Upon irradiation, BRCA1 was detected in discrete foci in the nucleus, which colocalize with hRad50. Formation of irradiation-induced foci positive for BRCA1, hRad50, hMre11, or p95 was dramatically reduced in HCC/1937 breast cancer cells carrying a homozygous mutation in BRCA1 but was restored by transfection of wild-type BRCA1. Ectopic expression of wild-type, but not mutated, BRCA1 in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the DNA damage agent, methyl methanesulfonate. These data suggest that BRCA1 is important for the cellular responses to DNA damage that are mediated by the hRad50-hMre11-p95 complex..

BRCA1 mutations cause increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer, frequently of early onset. Many different mutations occur in BRCA1, including several examples of recurrent mutations, each of which accounts for a significant number of families with heritable cancer predisposition. These common mutations have an etiological role in many breast and ovarian cancer cases and provide the opportunity to examine genotype-phenotype correlations and genotype-environment interactions in individuals with the identical BRCA1 lesion. We report a novel missense change in BRCA1, 2640 C-- > T (R841W), found in 3 cases from a subject group of 305 breast and 79 ovarian cancer cases from Orange County, CA. These are consecutive, population-based cases not selected for age or family history. In all three cases, there is a strong family history of breast, ovarian, or other cancers possibly related to a BRCA1 defect and family members showed a high concordance of cancer incidence with the presence of R841W. The age of cancer onset was not always distinct from typical sporadic cases. Testing of a sample of 413 unrelated individuals to examine the hypothesis that R841W might be a rare polymorphism detected one additional instance in a woman with breast cancer diagnosed at age 77 years, and cancer in one parent. R841W is likely to be an etiologically significant lesion with involvement in close to 1% (95% confidence interval of 0-1. 7%) of all breast and ovarian cancers in this population.

BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations are associated with an increased breast/ovarian cancer risk. Offspring gender ratios may be skewed against male births in BRCA1 mutation carriers. In addition, the lack of viable homozygous BRCA1/BRCA2-mutation carriers implies that recurrent miscarriages may be associated with homozygous fetuses. Jewish Israeli high-risk women who were tested for being carriers of the predominant BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in Jewish high-risk families were analyzed for the sex of offspring and the rate of spontaneous miscarriages. Overall, 817 women participated: 393 BRCA1/BRCA2-mutation carriers (229 with breast/ovarian cancer) and 424 high-risk noncarriers (208 with breast/ovarian cancer). No differences between the male-to-female offspring ratios of all study groups were noted. Among mutation carriers, the offspring male-to-female ratio was 0.97 (444 : 460), and among mutation carriers with cancer it was 0.92 (262 : 284). Similarly, no offspring gender skewing was noted among high-risk noncarriers, regardless of health status. The rates of three or more spontaneous miscarriages among participants with at least one live birth were 4.37% (15/343) among mutation carriers and 3% (12/401) among high-risk women (P = not significant). In conclusion, the offspring gender ratio is similar in high-risk Jewish families and in the general population. The issue of the rate of recurrent miscarriages in high-risk Jewish women is unresolved.
Baboon syndrome induced by ketoconazole.
Barium-supplemented Long-Evans hooded rats were characterized by a persistent hypertension that was evident after 1 month of barium (100 micrograms/ml mineral fortified water) treatment. Analysis of in vivo myocardial excitability, contractility, and metabolic characteristics at 16 months revealed other significant barium-induced disturbances within the cardiovascular system. The most distinctive aspect of the barium effect was a demonstrated hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital. Under barbiturate anesthesia, virtually all of the myocardial contractile indices were depressed significantly in barium-exposed rats relative to the corresponding control-fed rats. The lack of a similar response to ketamine and xylazine anesthesia revealed that the cardiovascular actions of sodium pentobarbital in barium-treated rats were linked specifically to this anesthetic, and were not representative of a generalized anesthetic response. Other myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes induced by barium were manifest, irrespective of the anesthetic employed. The contractile element shortening velocity of the cardiac muscle fibers was significantly slower in both groups of barium-treated rats relative to the control groups, irrespective of the anesthetic regimen. Similarly, significant disturbances in myocardial energy metabolism were detected in the barium-exposed rats which were consistent with the reduced contractile element shortening velocity. In addition, the excitability of the cardiac conduction system was depressed preferentially in the atrioventricular nodal region of hearts from barium-exposed rats. Overall, the altered cardiac contractility and excitability characteristics, the myocardial metabolic disturbances, and the hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital suggest the existence of a heretofore undescribed cardiomyopathic disorder induced by chronic barium exposure. These experimental findings represent the first indication that life-long barium ingestion may have significant adverse effects on the mammalian cardiovascular system.
Basal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychological distress in recreational ecstasy polydrug users.
Based on clinical data, indicating that chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) is an important metabolite of oxazaphosphorine cytostatics, an experimental study was carried out in order to elucidate the role of CAA in the development of hemorrhagic cystitis. The data demonstrate that CAA after i.v. administration does not contribute to bladder damage. When instilled directly into the bladder, CAA exerts urotoxic effects, it is, however, susceptible to detoxification with mesna.
Based on sequence homology to the human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (OATP2; SLC21A6), we cloned a new member of the SLC21A superfamily of solute carriers, termed OATP8 (SLC21A8). The protein of 702 amino acids showed an amino acid identity of 80% with human OATP2. Based on Northern blotting, the expression of OATP8 was restricted to human liver. Cosmid clones containing the genes encoding human OATP1 (SLC21A3), OATP2 (SLC21A6), and OATP8 (SLC21A8) served to establish their genomic organization. All three genes contained 14 exons with 13 identical splice sites when transferred to the amino acid sequence. An antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus localized OATP8 to the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes and the recombinant glycoprotein, expressed in MDCKII cells, to the lateral membrane. Transport properties of OATP8 were studied in stably transfected MDCKII and HEK293 cells. Organic anions transported by human OATP8 included sulfobromophthalein, with a K(m) of 3.3 microm, and 17beta-glucuronosyl estradiol, with a K(m) of 5.4 microm. Several bile salts were not substrates. Thus, human OATP8 is a new uptake transporter in the basolateral hepatocyte membrane with an overlapping but distinct substrate specificity as compared with OATP2, which is localized to the same membrane domain.
Baseline electrocardiogram abnormalities and market elevations not associated with myocardial necrosis make accurate diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) difficult in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. Troponin sampling may offer greater diagnostic utility in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes based on troponin positivity in patients with cocaine chest pain admitted for exclusion of MI. METHODS: Outcomes were examined in patients admitted for possible MI after cocaine use. All patients underwent a rapid rule-in protocol that included serial sampling of creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) over eight hours. Outcomes included CK-MB MI (CK-MB >or= 8 ng/mL with a relative index [(CK-MB x 100)/total CK] >or= 4, cardiac death, and significant coronary disease (>or=50%). RESULTS: Of the 246 admitted patients, 34 (14%) met CK-MB criteria for MI and 38 (16%) had cTnI elevations. Angiography was performed in 29 of 38 patients who were cTnI-positive, with significant disease present in 25 (86%). Three of the four patients without significant disease who had cTnI elevations met CK-MB criteria for MI, and the other had a peak CK-MB level of 13 ng/mL. Sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for predicting cardiac death or significant disease were high for both CK-MB MI and cTnI and were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with cTnI elevations meet CK-MB criteria for MI, as well as have a high incidence of underlying significant disease. Troponin appears to have an equivalent diagnostic accuracy compared with CK-MB for diagnosing necrosis in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain and suspected MI.
Basic and clinical research has demonstrated that dementia of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) type is associated with dysfunction of the insulin-receptor (IR) system followed by decreased glucose transport via glucose transporter GLUT4 and decreased glucose metabolism in brain cells. An alternative source of energy is d-galactose (the C-4-epimer of d-glucose) which is transported into the brain by insulin-independent GLUT3 transporter where it might be metabolized to glucose via the Leloir pathway. Exclusively parenteral daily injections of galactose induce memory deterioration in rodents and are used to generate animal aging model, but the effects of oral galactose treatment on cognitive functions have never been tested. We have investigated the effects of continuous daily oral galactose (200 mg/kg/day) treatment on cognitive deficits in streptozotocin-induced (STZ-icv) rat model of sAD, tested by Morris Water Maze and Passive Avoidance test, respectively. One month of oral galactose treatment initiated immediately after the STZ-icv administration, successfully prevented development of the STZ-icv-induced cognitive deficits. Beneficial effect of oral galactose was independent of the rat age and of the galactose dose ranging from 100 to 300 mg/kg/day. Additionally, oral galactose administration led to the appearance of galactose in the blood. The increase of galactose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was several times lower after oral than after parenteral administration of the same galactose dose. Oral galactose exposure might have beneficial effects on learning and memory ability and could be worth investigating for improvement of cognitive deficits associated with glucose hypometabolism in AD.
Bcl-2 is the best characterized inhibitor of apoptosis, although the molecular basis of this action is not fully understood. Using a protein interaction cloning procedure, we identified a human gene designated as bis (mapped to chromosome 10q25) that encoded a novel Bcl-2-interacting protein. Bis protein showed no significant homology with Bcl-2 family proteins and had no prominent functional motif. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that Bis interacted with Bcl-2 in vivo. DNA transfection experiments indicated that Bis itself exerted only weak anti-apoptotic activity, but was synergistic with Bcl-2 in preventing Bax-induced and Fas-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that Bis is a novel modulator of cellular anti-apoptotic activity that functions through its interaction with Bcl-2.

Because of a lack of contemporary data regarding seizures after cardiac surgery, we undertook a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 11 529 patients in whom cardiopulmonary bypass was used from January 2004 to December 2010. A convulsive seizure was defined as a transient episode of disturbed brain function characterised by abnormal involuntary motor movements. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative seizures. A total of 100 (0.9%) patients developed postoperative convulsive seizures. Generalised and focal seizures were identified in 68 and 32 patients, respectively. The median (IQR [range]) time after surgery when the seizure occurred was 7 (6-12 [1-216]) h and 8 (6-11 [4-18]) h, respectively. Epileptiform findings on electroencephalography were seen in 19 patients. Independent predictors of postoperative seizures included age, female sex, redo cardiac surgery, calcification of ascending aorta, congestive heart failure, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, duration of aortic cross-clamp and tranexamic acid. When tested in a multivariate regression analysis, tranexamic acid was a strong independent predictor of seizures (OR 14.3, 95% CI 5.5-36.7; p < 0.001). Patients with convulsive seizures had 2.5 times higher in-hospital mortality rates and twice the length of hospital stay compared with patients without convulsive seizures. Mean (IQR [range]) length of stay in the intensive care unit was 115 (49-228 [32-481]) h in patients with convulsive seizures compared with 26 (22-69 [14-1080]) h in patients without seizures (p < 0.001). Convulsive seizures are a serious postoperative complication after cardiac surgery. As tranexamic acid is the only modifiable factor, its administration, particularly in doses exceeding 80 mg.kg(-1), should be weighed against the risk of postoperative seizures.
Because of the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies (NASCIS), high-dose methylprednisolone became the standard of care for the acute spinal cord injury. In the NASCIS, there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute corticosteroid myopathy that high-dose methylprednisolone may cause. The dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2-day period for any clinical condition. We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients. Further, steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy, instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury. To our knowledge, this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the methylprednisolone recommended by NASCIS may cause acute corticosteroid myopathy.
Because of the rapid systemic clearance of BCNU (1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea), intra-arterial administration should provide a substantial advantage over intravenous administration for the treatment of malignant gliomas. Thirty-six patients were treated with BCNU every 6 to 8 weeks, either by transfemoral catheterization of the internal carotid or vertebral artery or through a fully implantable intracarotid drug delivery system, beginning with a dose of 200 mg/sq m body surface area. Twelve patients with Grade III or IV astrocytomas were treated after partial resection of the tumor without prior radiation therapy. After two to seven cycles of chemotherapy, nine patients showed a decrease in tumor size and surrounding edema on contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scans. In the nine responders, median duration of chemotherapy response from the time of operation was 25 weeks (range 12 to more than 91 weeks). The median duration of survival in the 12 patients was 54 weeks (range 21 to more than 156 weeks), with an 18-month survival rate of 42%. Twenty-four patients with recurrent Grade I to IV astrocytomas, whose resection and irradiation therapy had failed, received two to eight courses of intra-arterial BCNU therapy. Seventeen of these had a response or were stable for a median of 20 weeks (range 6 to more than 66 weeks). The catheterization procedure is safe, with no immediate complication in 111 infusions of BCNU. A delayed complication in nine patients has been unilateral loss of vision secondary to a retinal vasculitis. The frequency of visual loss decreased after the concentration of the ethanol diluent was lowered.
Because rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) have a high solute diuresis (glycosuria of 10 to 12 g/day), we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to gentamicin-induced acute renal failure (ARF). The protection from gentamicin nephrotoxicity was studied in non-diabetic rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular glucose reabsorption with phlorizin (P). DM rats with mild glycosuria (similar in degree to that of the P treated animals) were also studied. Unanesthetized adult female, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in four groups and studied for 15 days. Group 1 (P alone) received P, 360 mg/day, for 15 days; Group II (P + gentamicin); Group III (gentamicin alone) and Group IV (mild DM + gentamicin). Nephrotoxic doses (40 mg/kg body wt/day) of gentamicin were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups II to IV. In Group I, P induced a moderate and stable glycosuria (3.9 +/- 0.1 g/day, SE), and no functional or morphologic evidence of renal dysfunction (baseline CCr 2.1 +/- 0.1 ml/min, undetectable lysozymuria) or damage (tubular necrosis score [maximum 4], zero). In Group II, P did not prevent gentamicin-ARF (maximal decrease in CCr at day 9.89%, P less than 0.001; peak lysozymuria, 1863 +/- 321 micrograms/day; and tubular necrosis score, 3.9 +/- 0.1). These values were not different from those of Group III: maximal decrease in CCr 73% (P less than 0.001); lysozymuria, 2147 +/- 701 micrograms/day; tubular necrosis score, 3.8 +/- 0.1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to a lethal dose of morphine were evaluated in rats pretreated with saline or naloxazone, an antagonist of high-affinity mu 1 opioid receptors. Pretreatment with naloxazone significantly blocked morphine analgesia, catalepsy and hypothermia at a dose which completely eliminated high-affinity binding in brain membranes. Moreover, naloxazone significantly attenuated the morphine-induced hypotension and respiratory depression, whereas morphine-induced bradycardia was less affected. Results indicate that subpopulations of mu receptors may mediate selective behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to morphine.

Benign familial infantile convulsions (BFIC) is a rare autosomal dominant epilepsy syndrome. This syndrome has been recently described in Italian and French pedigrees. Patients present with partial, then generalized seizures, with onset at age three months. The seizures usually spontaneously cease after one year without treatment, leaving no neurological abnormalities. We have mapped BFIC to chromosome 19q in five Italian pedigrees. The sodium channel beta1 subunit gene (SCN1B) maps to this candidate region and has been shown to be involved in one Australian pedigree with generalized epilepsy and febrile seizures " plus " (GEFS +). In this family, a missense mutation in SCN1B cosegregates with the GEFS + phenotype. BFIC and GEFS + have clinical features in common, therefore SCN1B is a candidate gene for BFIC. We studied SCN1B exons 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, using four SSCP methods in 10 Caucasian BFIC probands of Western Europe. We found no exon variants. One variant was identified in intron 5 (IVS5-10C > G), which did not segregate with BFIC and was observed in 9. 2% controls. A second variant in intron 5 was identified (IVS5 + 30G > A). It was rare, as not observed in controls, but not segregating with the BFIC phenotype.
Benzylacyclouridine reverses azidothymidine-induced marrow suppression without impairment of anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity.
Bepridil, a novel active compound for prophylactic treatment of anginal attacks, induced persistent bradycardia and a non-specific anti-tachycardial effect, the mechanisms of which were investigated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro perfusion of bepridil in the life-support medium for isolated sino-atrial tissue from rabbit heart, caused a reduction in action potential (AP) spike frequency (recorded by KCl microelectrodes) starting at doses of 5 X 10(-6) M. This effect was dose-dependent up to concentrations of 5 X 10(-5) M, whereupon blockade of sinus activity set in. Bepridil at a dose of 5 X 10(-6) M, induced a concomitant reduction in AP amplitude (falling from 71 +/- 8 mV to 47 +/- 6 mV), maximum systolic depolarization velocity (phase 0) which fell from 1.85 +/- 0.35 V/s to 0.84 +/- 0.28 V/s, together with maximum diastolic depolarization velocity (phase 4) which fell from 38 +/- 3 mV/s to 24 +/- 5 mV/s. In vivo injection of bepridil at a dose of 5 mg/kg (i.v.) into 6 anaesthetized dogs which had undergone ablation of all the extrinsic cardiac afferent nerve supply, together with a bilateral medullo-adrenalectomy, caused a marked reduction in heart rate which fell from 98.7 +/- 4.2 beats/min to 76 +/- 5.3 beats/min sustained for more than 45 min. It is concluded that bepridil reduces heart rate by acting directly on the sinus node. This effect, which results in a flattening of the phase 0 and phase 4 slope, together with a longer AP duration, may be due to an increase in the time constants of slow inward ionic currents (already demonstrated elsewhere), but also to an increased time constant for deactivation of the outward potassium current (Ip).
Best macular dystrophy (BMD), also known as vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD2; OMIM 153700), is an autosomal dominant form of macular degeneration characterized by an abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin within and beneath the retinal pigment epithelium cells. In pursuit of the disease gene, we limited the minimum genetic region by recombination breakpoint analysis and mapped to this region a novel retina-specific gene (VMD2). Genetic mapping data, identification of five independent disease-specific mutations and expression studies provide evidence that mutations within the candidate gene are a cause of BMD. The 3' UTR of the candidate gene contains a region of antisense complementarity to the 3' UTR of the ferritin heavy-chain gene (FTH1), indicating the possibility of antisense interaction between VMD2 and FTH1 transcripts.

Binding of nicotine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) elicits a series of dose-dependent behaviors that go from altered exploration, sedation, and tremors, to seizures and death. nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits. A gene cluster comprises the alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 subunits, which coassemble to form functional receptors. We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. beta4 -/- mice were less sensitive to the effects of nicotine both at low doses, measured as decreased exploration in an open field, and at high doses, measured as sensitivity to nicotine-induced seizures. Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits, we showed that alpha5 mRNA levels are unchanged, whereas alpha3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 -/- brains. alpha3 +/- mice were partially resistant to nicotine-induced seizures when compared to wild-type littermates. mRNA levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 +/- brains. Together, these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion.

Biochemical effects of Solidago virgaurea extract on experimental cardiotoxicity.
Biotinidase (EC 3.5.1.12) catalyzes the hydrolysis of biocytin, the product of biotin-dependent carboxylase degradation, to biotin and lysine. Biotinidase deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder of biotin recycling that is characterized by neurological and cutaneous abnormalities, and can be successfully treated with biotin supplementation. Sequences of tryptic peptides of the purified human serum enzyme were used to design oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification from human hepatic total RNA to generate putative biotinidase cDNA fragments. Sequence analysis of a cDNA isolated from a human liver library by plaque hybridization with the largest cDNA probe revealed an open reading frame of 1629 bases encoding a protein of 543 amino acid residues, including 41 amino acids of a potential signal peptide. Comparison of the open reading frame with the known biotinidase tryptic peptides and recognition of the expressed protein encoded by this cDNA by monoclonal antibodies prepared against purified biotinidase demonstrated the identity of this cDNA. Southern analyses suggested that biotinidase is a single copy gene and revealed that human cDNA probes hybridized to genomic DNA from mammals, but not from chicken or yeast. Northern analysis indicated the presence of biotinidase mRNA in human heart, brain, placenta, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas.

Bipolar affective disorder (BPAD; manic-depressive illness) is characterized by episodes of mania and/or hypomania interspersed with periods of depression. Compelling evidence supports a significant genetic component in the susceptibility to develop BPAD. To date, however, linkage studies have attempted only to identify chromosomal loci that cause or increase the risk of developing BPAD. To determine whether there could be protective alleles that prevent or reduce the risk of developing BPAD, similar to what is observed in other genetic disorders, we used mental health wellness (absence of any psychiatric disorder) as the phenotype in our genome-wide linkage scan of several large multigeneration Old Order Amish pedigrees exhibiting an extremely high incidence of BPAD. We have found strong evidence for a locus on chromosome 4p at D4S2949 (maximum GENEHUNTER-PLUS nonparametric linkage score = 4. 05, P = 5. 22 x 10 (-4); SIBPAL Pempirical value < 3 x 10 (-5)) and suggestive evidence for a locus on chromosome 4q at D4S397 (maximum GENEHUNTER-PLUS nonparametric linkage score = 3. 29, P = 2. 57 x 10 (-3); SIBPAL Pempirical value < 1 x 10 (-3)) that are linked to mental health wellness. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that certain alleles could prevent or modify the clinical manifestations of BPAD and perhaps other related affective disorders.

Blood brain barrier in right- and left-pawed female rats assessed by a new staining method.
Blood pressure (BP) is more salt sensitive in men than in premenopausal women. In Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DS), high-salt (HS) diet increases BP more in males than females. In contrast to the systemic renin-angiotensin system, which is suppressed in response to HS in male DS, intrarenal angiotensinogen expression is increased, and intrarenal levels of ANG II are not suppressed. In this study, the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in HS-induced upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen mediated by testosterone that also causes increases in BP and renal injury. On a low-salt (LS) diet, male DS had higher levels of intrarenal angiotensinogen mRNA than females. HS diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical angiotensinogen mRNA and protein only in male DS, which was prevented by castration. Ovariectomy of female DS had no effect on intrarenal angiotensinogen expression on either diet. Radiotelemetric BP was similar between males and castrated rats on LS diet. HS diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in BP, protein and albumin excretion, and glomerular sclerosis in male DS rats, which were attenuated by castration. Testosterone replacement in castrated DS rats increased BP, renal injury, and upregulation of renal angiotensinogen associated with HS diet. Testosterone contributes to the development of hypertension and renal injury in male DS rats on HS diet possibly through upregulation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system.
Blood pressure effects of i.v. levodopa were examined in parkinsonian patients with stable and fluctuating responses to levodopa. The magnitude of the hypotensive effect of levodopa was concentration dependent and was fit to an Emax model in fluctuating responders. Stable responders demonstrated a small hypotensive response. Baseline blood pressures were higher in fluctuating patients; a higher baseline blood pressure correlated with greater hypotensive effects. Antiparkinsonian effects of levodopa temporally correlated with blood pressure changes. Phenylalanine, a large neutral amino acid (LNAA) competing with levodopa for transport across the blood-brain barrier, reduced the hypotensive and antiparkinsonian effects of levodopa. We conclude that levodopa has a central hypotensive action that parallels the motor effects in fluctuating patients. The hypotensive effect appears to be related to the higher baseline blood pressure we observed in fluctuating patients relative to stable patients.

Bone marrow transplant in adrenoleukodystrophy.
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a highly conserved class of signaling molecules that induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation in vivo. Dysregulated expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is found in the cells of patients who have fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a genetic disorder of axial and appendicular skeletal malformation and progressive heterotopic ossification. Loss of function mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein 5 (bmp5) gene leading to under-expression of BMP5 cause the murine short ear syndrome, characterized by small malformed ears and a broad range of axial skeletal malformations. We found features reminiscent of both the short ear mouse and FOP in a child with malformed external ears, multiple malformations of the axial skeleton, and progressive heterotopic ossification in the neck and back. We examined BMP mRNA expression in transformed lymphocytes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and protein expression by ELISA assays and immunohistochemistry. Elevated levels of BMP4 and BMP5 mRNA and protein were detected in the patient's cells while levels of BMP2 mRNA were unchanged. Our data suggest that dysregulated expression of BMP4 and BMP5 genes is associated with an array of human axial skeletal abnormalities similar to the short ear mouse and FOP.
Bone pain after transplantation is a frequent complication that can be caused by several diseases. Treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the pain. Nine patients with severe pain in their feet, which was registered after transplantation, were investigated. Bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the painful bones. Pain was not explained by other diseases causing foot pain, like reflex sympathetic dystrophy, polyneuropathy, Morton's neuralgia, gout, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, intermittent claudication, orthopaedic foot deformities, stress fractures, and hyperparathyroidism. The reduction of cyclosporine- or tacrolimus trough levels and the administration of calcium channel blockers led to relief of pain. The Calcineurin-inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS) is a rare but severe side effect of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans. Incorrect diagnosis of the syndrome will lead to a significant reduction of life quality in patients suffering from CIPS.
Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS) is a syndromal X-linked mental retardation, which maps by linkage to the q26 region of the human X chromosome. We have identified a male patient with BFLS-like features and a duplication, 46, Y, dup (X) (q26q28), inherited from his phenotypically normal mother. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation using yeast artificial chromosome clones from Xq26 localised the duplication breakpoint to an approximately 400-kb interval in the Xq26. 3 region between DXS155 and DXS294/DXS730. Database searches and analysis of available genomic DNA sequence from the region revealed the presence of the fibroblast growth factor homologous factor gene, FHF2, within the duplication breakpoint interval. The gene structure of FHF2 was determined and two new exons were identified, including a new 5 end exon, 1B. FHF2 is a large gene extending over approximately 200 kb in Xq26. 3 and is composed of at least seven exons. It shows tissue-specific alternative splicing and alternative transcription starts. Northern blot hybridisation showed highest expression in brain and skeletal muscle. The FHF2 gene localisation and tissue-specific expression pattern suggest it to be a candidate gene for familial cases of the BFLS syndrome and other syndromal and non-specific forms of X-linked mental retardation mapping to the region.
Bortezomib (bort)-dexamethasone (dex) is an effective therapy for relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM). This retrospective study investigated the combination of bort (1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 weeks) and dex (20 mg on the day of and the day after bort) as salvage treatment in 85 patients with R/R MM after prior autologous stem cell transplantation or conventional chemotherapy. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 2. Eighty-seven percent of the patients had received immunomodulatory drugs included in some line of therapy before bort-dex. The median number of bort-dex cycles was 6, up to a maximum of 12 cycles. On an intention-to-treat basis, 55 % of the patients achieved at least partial response, including 19 % CR and 35 % achieved at least very good partial response. Median durations of response, time to next therapy and treatment-free interval were 8, 11.2, and 5.1 months, respectively. The most relevant adverse event was peripheral neuropathy, which occurred in 78 % of the patients (grade II, 38 %; grade III, 21 %) and led to treatment discontinuation in 6 %. With a median follow up of 22 months, median time to progression, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 8.9, 8.7, and 22 months, respectively. Prolonged PFS and OS were observed in patients achieving CR and receiving bort-dex a single line of prior therapy. Bort-dex was an effective salvage treatment for MM patients, particularly for those in first relapse.
Bortezomib and dexamethasone as salvage therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: analysis of long-term clinical outcomes.
Bortezomib and high-dose dexamethasone-containing regimens are considered to be generally tolerable with few severe bacterial infections in patients with B-cell malignancies. However, information is limited concerning the safety of the regimen in elderly patients. We report a case of a 76-year-old man with Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia who suffered necrotising fasciitis without neutropenia after the combination treatment with bortezomib, high-dose dexamethasone and rituximab. Despite immediate intravenous antimicrobial therapy, he succumbed 23 h after the onset. Physicians should recognise the possibility of fatal bacterial infections related to bortezomib plus high-dose dexamethasone in elderly patients, and we believe this case warrants further investigation.

Bradykinin exerts a broad spectrum of cellular effects on different tissues. It is believed that these effects are predominantly mediated by the recently cloned B2 receptor. The mechanism of post-receptor signal transduction is not known in detail. Involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) was suggested and activation of the classical PKC isoforms alpha and beta was recently demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the B2 receptor also activates new (delta, epsilon) and atypical (zeta) PKC isoforms. To investigate this, chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, stably transfected with human B2 receptor, were used. In these cells the PKC isoforms alpha, delta, epsilon and zeta were detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. To monitor hormone-induced PKC translocation plasma membranes were prepared. Stimulation of the cells with bradykinin resulted in a rapid (30-60 s) translocation of the PKC isoforms alpha, epsilon, and zeta. Translocation of PKC delta was not detected. The effect of bradykinin was reduced by simultaneous addition of the receptor antagonist HOE 140, a bradykinin-related decapeptide. The data show that the B2 receptor in this cell model is able to activate, in addition to the classical PKC isoform alpha, the new PKC isoform epsilon and the atypical PKC isoform zeta. To test whether these effects are as well observed in a non-transfected cell, the experiments were repeated in human foreskin fibroblasts which naturally express high levels of B2 receptors. In this cell system similar results on PKC alpha, epsilon, and zeta were observed, suggesting that all three PKC isoforms are involved in signal transduction of the B2 receptor.

Breast cancer accounts for 30-40% of all deaths from cancers in females. In an effort to identify tumor associated antigens that may be useful for immunotherapy, we utilized serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX) technique to identify breast cancer-associated antigens. SEREX screening of cDNA expression libraries derived from 3 breast cancer patients identified a total of 88 positive clones (bcg-1 to bcg-88), including 27 hitherto unknown sequences. The cDNA sequences and mRNA expression patterns were characterized. Seroreactivity of the SEREX clones were determined in sera from 75 breast cancer patients, 75 colon cancer patients, and 25 healthy donors. Expression analysis on a cDNA panel from 17 different normal tissues by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed tissue restricted mRNA expression of 2 of the 27 unknown antigens. Bcg-72 is expressed only in breast, prostate and thymus, while bcg-84 is expressed at moderate levels in testis, spleen and breast. The other 25 unknown antigens were expressed in most other tissues. Serologic assay revealed that 7 out of the 88 clones showed reactivity to at least one serum from either 75 breast or 75 colon cancer patients. These clones did not react with sera from a panel of 25 healthy adult individuals. Our results demonstrate the utility of the SEREX approach for the identification of potential tumor associated antigens in human breast cancer.
Breast cancer in men is about a hundredfold less common than in women and this has hindered research into its genetic basis. We have examined 22 families with at least one case of male breast cancer for linkage to the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer locus, BRCA1, on chromosome 17q. We found strong evidence against linkage to BRCA1 (lod score-16. 63) and the best estimate of the proportion of linked families was 0% (95% CI 0-18%). Our results indicate that there is a gene (s) other than BRCA1 which predisposes to early-onset breast cancer in women and which confers a higher risk of male breast cancer. Identification of additional pedigrees that include cases of male breast cancer may therefore facilitate the mapping and isolation of this gene.
Bupropion (Zyban) toxicity.
Bupropion is a monocyclic antidepressant structurally related to amphetamine. Zyban, a sustained-release formulation of bupropion hydrochloride, was recently released in Ireland, as a smoking cessation aid. In the initial 6 months since it's introduction, 12 overdose cases have been reported to The National Poisons Information Centre. 8 patients developed symptoms of toxicity. Common features included tachycardia, drowsiness, hallucinations and convulsions. Two patients developed severe cardiac arrhythmias, including one patient who was resuscitated following a cardiac arrest. All patients recovered without sequelae. We report a case of a 31 year old female who required admission to the Intensive Care Unit for ventilation and full supportive therapy, following ingestion of 13.5g bupropion. Recurrent seizures were treated with diazepam and broad complex tachycardia was successfully treated with adenosine. Zyban caused significant neurological and cardiovascular toxicity in overdose. The potential toxic effects should be considered when prescribing it as a smoking cessation aid.
Burkitt-type acute leukemia cells were present in the bone marrow of a patient with B-prolymphocytic leukemia diagnosed from peripheral blood cell morphology. Immunophenotype analysis confirmed morphological patterns. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed an identical t(8;22)(q24;q21) with MYC locus rearrangement in blood and bone marrow cells, with additional chromosome abnormalities in the bone marrow. In addition, the loss of one copy of the TP53 gene and identical IGH DNA clonal rearrangements were shown with FISH and polymerase chain reaction analysis respectively in the two types of leukemic cells. These data indicated the common origin of the two coexisting leukemias and are the first example of such occurrence in a leukemic patient.
Burkitt-type acute leukemia in a patient with B-prolymphocytic leukemia: evidence for a common origin.
Busulfan is known to be neurotoxic in animals and humans, but its acute neurotoxicity remains poorly characterized in children. We report here a retrospective study of 123 children (median age, 6.5 years) receiving high-dose busulfan in combined chemotherapy before bone marrow transplantation for malignant solid tumors, brain tumors excluded. Busulfan was given p.o., every 6 hours for 16 doses over 4 days. Two total doses were consecutively used: 16 mg/kg, then 600 mg/m2. The dose calculation on the basis of body surface area results in higher doses in young children than in older patients (16 to 28 mg/kg). Ninety-six patients were not given anticonvulsive prophylaxis; 7 (7.5%) developed seizures during the 4 days of the busulfan course or within 24 h after the last dosing. When the total busulfan dose was taken into account, there was a significant difference in terms of neurotoxicity incidence among patients under 16 mg/kg (1 of 57, 1.7%) and patients under 600 mg/m2 (6 of 39, 15.4%) (P less than 0.02). Twenty-seven patients were given a 600-mg/m2 busulfan total dose with continuous i.v. infusion of clonazepam; none had any neurological symptoms. Busulfan levels were measured by a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry assay in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of 9 children without central nervous system disease under 600 mg/m2 busulfan with clonazepam:busulfan cerebrospinal fluid:plasma ratio was 1.39. This was significantly different (P less than 0.02) from the cerebrospinal fluid:plasma ratio previously defined in children receiving a 16-mg/kg total dose of busulfan. This study shows that busulfan neurotoxicity is dose-dependent in children and efficiently prevented by clonazepam. A busulfan dose calculated on the basis of body surface area, resulting in higher doses in young children, was followed by increased neurotoxicity, close to neurotoxicity incidence observed in adults. Since plasma pharmacokinetic studies showed a faster busulfan clearance in children than in adults, this new dose may approximate more closely the adult systemic exposure obtained after the usual 16-mg/kg total dose, with potential inferences in terms of anticancer or myeloablative effects. The busulfan dose in children and infants undergoing bone marrow transplantation should be reconsidered on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies.
Busulfan-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.
Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency is characterized by prolonged apnea after the use of muscle relaxants (suxamethonium or mivacurium) in patients who have mutations in the BCHE gene. Here, we report a case of prolonged neuromuscular block after administration of suxamethonium leading to the discovery of a novel BCHE variant (c.695T>A, p.Val204Asp). Inhibition studies, kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how this mutation disrupts the catalytic triad and determines a "silent" phenotype. Low activity of patient plasma butyrylcholinesterase with butyrylthiocholine (BTC) and benzoylcholine, and values of dibucaine and fluoride numbers fit with heterozygous atypical silent genotype. Electrophoretic analysis of plasma BChE of the proband and his mother showed that patient has a reduced amount of tetrameric enzyme in plasma and that minor fast-moving BChE components: monomer, dimer, and monomer-albumin conjugate are missing. Kinetic analysis showed that the p.Val204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr BChE displays a pure Michaelian behavior with BTC as the substrate. Both catalytic parameters Km = 265 uM for BTC, two times higher than that of the atypical enzyme, and a low Vmax are consistent with the absence of activity against suxamethonium. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations showed that the overall effect of the mutation p.Val204Asp is disruption of hydrogen bonding between Gln223 and Glu441, leading Ser198 and His438 to move away from each other with subsequent disruption of the catalytic triad functionality regardless of the type of substrate. MD also showed that the enzyme volume is increased, suggesting a pre-denaturation state. This fits with the reduced concentration of p.Ala204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr tetrameric enzyme in the plasma and non-detectable fast moving-bands on electrophoresis gels.
Butyrylcholinesterase gene mutations in patients with prolonged apnea after succinylcholine for electroconvulsive therapy.
By homology screening using BLAST searches of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), we have found a previously unidentified cDNA encoding a putative seven-transmembrane receptor with highest similarity to the leukotriene B(4) receptor, BLTR. Analysis of calcium flow in transfected cells, along with sequence analysis, revealed that the EST encoded a functionally inactive protein, lacking the segment corresponding to the C-terminal part of the putative receptor protein. The missing segment was obtained by PCR amplification of a human leukocyte cDNA library and ligated to the truncated EST cDNA. The novel cDNA encodes a full-length receptor with 39% identity to the previously cloned BLTR. Studies of intracellular calcium flow of transfected HeLa cells exposed to various leukotrienes showed that also the novel BLTR-like receptor can be activated by leukotriene B(4), and it is therefore tentatively named BLTR2.

By routine screening of sera, a subject was discovered who showed a sub-total deficiency of C6 and C7. No clinical disease was associated with this deficiency which was transmitted through the subjects family as a single genetic characteristic, the C6 deficiency being associated with a silent allele at the structural locus. The propositus was found to have low quantities of an abnormal C6 which was both antigenically deficient and smaller in size than normal C6 (110, 000 daltons compared with 140, 000 daltons) and small quantities of apparently normal C7. It is concluded that the most likely explanation for this defect is that the subject has a structural mutation in his C6 gene which produces hyopsynthesis not only of C6 but also of the closely linked gene for C7. These findings suggest the possibility that C6 and C7 may function as a single genetic unit and that the primary transcript copied from the genome includes information for both proteins..
By screening a human genomic library with an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) cDNA probe, we have isolated a 15 kb clone which contains the entire coding region of the gene as expressed in monocytes, and includes 6 kb of 5'-upstream sequence. The gene contains four exons which code for the secreted form of the IL-1ra, however, our clone does not contain the alternative first exon used to generate an intracellular form of the protein as the protein as found in epithelial cells. Analysis of the sequence reveals a consensus TATA box, and three Alu repeats, two of which are in the upstream region and one in intron 3. The sequence also reveals an 86 bp motif tandomly repeated four times within intron 2, and may reflect the polymorphism known to exist in this region of the gene. By in-situ fluorescence hybridization we have shown that the IL-1ra gene is found on the long arm of chromosome 2 and maps to 2q13-14.1. Previous studies have revealed that IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta and both type I and type II forms of the IL-1 receptor all map close to this region of chromosome 2.
By sequencing regions flanking the beta-globin gene complex in mouse (Hbbc) and human (HBBC), we have shown that the beta-globin gene cluster is surrounded by a larger cluster of olfactory receptor genes (ORGs). To facilitate sequence comparisons and to investigate the regulation of ORG expression, we have mapped 5' sequences of mRNA from olfactory epithelium encoding beta-globin-proximal ORGs. We have found that several of these genes contain multiple noncoding exons that can be alternatively spliced. Surprisingly, the only common motifs found in the promoters of these genes are a "TATA" box and a purine-rich motif. Sequence comparisons between human and mouse reveal that most of the conserved regions are confined to the coding regions and transcription units of the genes themselves, but a few blocks of conserved sequence also are found outside of ORG transcription units. The possible influence of beta-globin regulatory sequences on ORG expression in olfactory epithelium was tested in mice containing a deletion of the endogenous beta-globin locus control region, but no change in expression of the neighboring ORGs was detected. We evaluate the implications of these results for possible mechanisms of regulation of ORG transcription.
By using a yeast two-hybrid assay, cyclic AMP-response-element-binding protein-related protein (CREB-RP), also called activating transcription factor 6beta (ATF6beta), was identified as a cellular protein that interacts with the NS4B protein of hepatitis C virus. An N-terminal half of NS4B and a central portion of CREB-RP/ATF6beta containing the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain were involved in the interaction. The interaction between NS4B and CREB-RP/ATF6beta was demonstrated also in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic analyses using specific antibodies. The bZIP domain of ATF6alpha, which shares high sequence similarity with CREB-RP/ATF6beta, was also shown to interact with NS4B in yeast although the interaction was weaker than that between NS4B and CREB-RP/ATF6beta. CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha are known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced transcription factors. Collectively, our results imply the possibility that NS4B modulates certain cellular responses upon ER stress through the physical interaction with CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha.
C1q, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and pulmonary surfactant protein A (SPA) interact with human monocytes and macrophages, resulting in the enhancement of phagocytosis of suboptimally opsonized targets. mAbs that recognize a cell surface molecule of 126,000 Mr, designated C1qRP, have been shown to inhibit C1q- and MBL-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis. Similar inhibition of the SPA-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis by these mAbs now suggests that C1qRP is a common component of a receptor for these macromolecules. Ligation of human monocytes with immobilized R3, a IgM mAb recognizing C1qRP, also triggers enhanced phagocytic capacity of these cells in the absence of ligand, verifying the direct involvement of this polypeptide in the regulation of phagocytosis. While the cDNA for C1qRP encodes a 631 amino acid membrane protein, Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the cDNA of the C1qRP coding region express a surface glycoprotein with the identical 126,000 Mr in SDS-PAGE as the native C1qRP. Use of glycosylation inhibitors, cleavage of the mature C1qRP with specific glycosidases, and in vitro translation of C1qRP cDNA demonstrated that both posttranslational glycosylation and the nature of the amino acid sequence of the protein contribute to the difference between its predicted m.w. and its migration on SDS-PAGE. These results verify that the cDNA cloned codes for the mature C1qRP, that C1qRP contains a relatively high degree of O-linked glycoslyation, and that C1qRP cross-linked directly by monoclonal anti-C1qRP or engaged as a result of cell surface ligation of SPA, as well as C1q and MBL, enhances phagocytosis.
C1qRP is a heavily O-glycosylated cell surface protein involved in the regulation of phagocytic activity.

CASE: A 49-year-old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing. On electrocardiogram, episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia were recorded immediately after swallowing; 24-hour Holter monitoring recorded several events. The arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol, but recurred a year later. The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of salbutamol. After stopping the beta-agonist, and after a week with the atenolol, the arrhythmia disappeared. DISCUSSION: Swallowing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia (SIAT) is a rare phenomenon. Fewer than 50 cases of SIAT have been described in the literature. This article summarizes all the cases published, creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to SIAT. It discusses demographics, clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia, postulated mechanisms of SIAT, and different treatment possibilities such as medications, surgery, and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). CONCLUSION: Salbutamol is presented here as a possible trigger for SIAT. Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report, it is logical to think that a beta-agonist like salbutamol (known to induce tachycardia) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta-blocker such as atenolol (that blocks the adrenergic activity) may relieve it.
CASE: We describe a second case of fluconazole associated agranulocytosis with thrombocytopenia and recovery upon discontinuation of therapy. The patient began to have changes in white blood cells and platelets within 48 h of administration of fluconazole and began to recover with 48 h of discontinuation. This case highlights that drug-induced blood dyscrasias can occur unexpectedly as a result of treatment with a commonly used drug thought to be "safe". CONCLUSION: According to Naranjo's algorithm the likelihood that our patient's agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia occurred as a result of therapy with fluconazole is probable, with a total of six points. We feel that the weight of the overall evidence of this evidence is strong. In particular the temporal relationship of bone marrow suppression to the initiation of fluconazole and the abatement of symptoms that rapidly reversed immediately following discontinuation.
CB 3717, N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid, is a tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) whose cytotoxicity is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme. Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of CB 3717 polyglutamates. Following a 12-hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [3H]CB 3717, 30% of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as CB 3717 tetra- and pentaglutamate, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, CB 3717 di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than CB 3717, respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of CB 3717 cytotoxicity. In early clinical studies with CB 3717, activity has been seen in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatoma, and mesothelioma. Toxicities included hepatotoxicity, malaise, and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of CB 3717 under acidic conditions. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a clinical trial of CB 3717 administered with alkaline diuresis is under way. Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg/m2 suggest that a reduction in nephrotoxicity may have been achieved with only 1 instance of renal toxicity in 10 patients. Hepatotoxicity and malaise are again the most frequent side effects. Evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients. Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter CB 3717 plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved.
CBF1 is a member of the CSL family of DNA binding factors, which mediate either transcriptional repression or transcriptional activation. CSL proteins play a central role in Notch signaling and in Epstein-Barr virus-induced immortalization. Notch is a transmembrane protein involved in cell-fate decisions, and the cytoplasmic domain of Notch (NotchIC) targets CBF1. The Epstein-Barr virus-immortalizing protein EBNA2 activates both cellular and viral gene expression by targeting CBF1 and mimicking NotchIC. We have examined the mechanism of CBF1-mediated repression and show that CBF1 binds to a unique corepressor, CBF1 interacting corepressor (CIR). A CIR homolog is encoded by Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating that CIR is evolutionarily conserved. Two CBF1 mutants that were unable to bind CIR did not function as repressors, suggesting that targeting of CIR to CBF1 is an important component of repression. When expressed as a Gal4 fusion protein, CIR repressed reporter gene expression. CIR binds to histone deacetylase and to SAP30 and serves as a linker between CBF1 and the histone deacetylase complex.
CCNU (lomustine) toxicity in dogs: a retrospective study (2002-07).
CD3 proteins may have redundant as well as specific contributions to the intracellular propagation and final effector responses of TCR-mediated signals at different checkpoints during T cell differentiation. We report here on the participation of CD3 gamma in the activation and effector function of human mature T lymphocytes at the antigen recognition checkpoint. Following TCR-CD3 engagement of human CD3 gamma-deficient T cell lines, and despite their lower TCR-CD3 surface levels compared to normal controls, mature T cell responses such as protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the regulation of expression of several cell surface molecules, including the TCR-CD3 itself, were either normal or only slightly affected. In contrast, other physiological responses like the specific adhesion and concomitant cell polarization on ICAM-1-coated dishes were selectively defective, and activation-induced cell death was increased. Our data indicate that CD3 gamma contributes essential specialized signaling functions to certain mature T cell responses. Failure to generate appropriate interactions may abort cytoskeleton reorganization and initiate an apoptotic response.
CD34 and podocalyxin are structurally related sialomucins, which are expressed in multiple tissues including vascular endothelium and hematopoietic progenitors. These glycoproteins have been proposed to be involved in processes as diverse as glomerular filtration, inhibition of stem cell differentiation, and leukocyte-endothelial adhesion. Using homologies present in the cytoplasmic tails of these proteins, we have identified a novel member of this family, which we designate endoglycan. This protein shares a similar overall domain structure with the other family members including a sialomucin domain, but also possesses an extremely acidic amino-terminal region. In addition, endoglycan contains several potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites and is modified with chondroitin sulfate. Endoglycan mRNA and protein were detected in both endothelial cells and CD34(+) bone marrow cells. Thus, CD34, podocalyxin, and endoglycan comprise a family of sialomucins sharing both structural similarity and sequence homology, which are expressed by both endothelium and multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. While the members of this family may perform overlapping functions at these sites, the unique structural features of endoglycan suggest distinct functions for this molecule.
CD93 is a approximately 120 kDa O-sialoglycoprotein that within the hematopoietic system is selectively expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage. So far, its primary structure and function were unknown. We used retroviral-expression cloning to isolate the CD93 cDNA. Sequence analysis revealed that CD93 is identical to a protein on human phagocytes termed C1q receptor (C1qRp). C1qRp was shown previously to mediate enhancement of phagocytosis in monocytes and was suggested to be a receptor of C1q and two other structurally related molecules. When studying CD93 transductants and control cells, we found that cells expressing CD93 have enhanced capacity to bind C1q. Furthermore, we show that immature dendritic cells (DC) express CD93/C1qRp, and mature DC, known to have reduced capacity for antigen uptake and to have lost the ability to phagocytose, show weak-to-negative CD93/C1qRp expression.
CDKN2A and CDK4 are the only known high-penetrant genes conferring proneness to cutaneous melanoma. The CDKN2A locus consists of four exons and encodes several alternate transcripts, two of which are p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), and originate from different open reading frames. Exon 1alpha is specific for p16(INK4a), while exon 1beta characterizes p14(ARF). Most CDKN2A mutations are located in exons 1alpha and 2, while exon 1beta variations have been identified in rare melanoma-prone pedigrees. In a previous study, we investigated 155 Italian melanoma cases, including 94 familial melanomas (FAMs) and 61 sporadic multiple primary melanomas (MPMs), for p16(INK4a)/CDK4 germline alterations and identified 15 p16(INK4a) and 1 CDK4 point mutations. In the present work, we extended our search to p14(ARF) mutations and CDKN2A deletions in the remaining samples. We identified the recurrent g.193+1G> A mutation in two FAM cases, while an additional pedigree displayed the previously undescribed variant g.161G> A. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) screening for copy variations resulted negative in all cases. In Italy, the overall frequency of p14(ARF) mutations is 3.2% in FAM and 0% in sporadic MPM. Re-evaluation of our patients' cohort emphasizes that the chance of identifying CDKN2A/CDK4 mutations in FAM is mainly influenced by the number of affected family members and the presence of one or more MPM cases. Accordingly, mutation rate rises to 61% in selected cases. Further studies are expected in order to investigate CDKN2A rarer mutations, including atypical deletions and inherited epimutations.

CI-921 (NSC 343499; 9-[[2-methoxy-4-[(methylsulphonyl)amino]phenyl]amino] -N,5-dimethyl- 4-acridinecarboxamide) is a topoisomerase II poison with high experimental antitumour activity. It was administered by 15 min infusion to 16 evaluable patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (7 with no prior treatment, 9 patients in relapse following surgery/radiotherapy) at a dose (648 mg/m2 divided over 3 days, repeated every 3 weeks) determined by phase I trial. Patients had a median performance status of 1 (WHO), and median age of 61 years. The histology comprised squamous carcinoma (11), adenocarcinoma (1), mixed histology (2), bronchio-alveolar carcinoma (1) and large cell undifferentiated carcinoma (1). Neutropenia grade greater than or equal to 3 was seen in 15 patients, infections with recovery in 3, and grand mal seizures in 1 patient. Grade less than or equal to 2 nausea and vomiting occurred in 66% courses and phlebitis in the infusion arm in 37%. 1 patient with squamous cell carcinoma achieved a partial response lasting 5 months. Further testing in this and other tumour types using multiple daily schedules is warranted.

CNS toxic effects of the antineoplastic agent ifosfamide (IFX) are frequent and include a variety of neurological symptoms that can limit drug use. We report a case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe, disabling negative myoclonus of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of ifosfamide for plasmacytoma. He was awake, revealed no changes of mental status and at rest there were no further motor symptoms. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and extensive laboratory studies failed to reveal structural lesions of the brain and metabolic abnormalities. An electroencephalogram showed continuous, generalized irregular slowing with admixed periodic triphasic waves indicating symptomatic encephalopathy. The administration of ifosfamide was discontinued and within 12 h the asterixis resolved completely. In the patient described, the presence of asterixis during infusion of ifosfamide, normal laboratory findings and imaging studies and the resolution of symptoms following the discontinuation of the drug suggest that negative myoclonus is associated with the use of IFX.
CONTEXT Most hereditary ovarian cancers are associated with germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Attempts to define the clinical significance of BRCA mutation status in ovarian cancer have produced conflicting results, especially regarding survival. OBJECTIVE To determine whether hereditary ovarian cancers have distinct clinical and pathological features compared with sporadic (nonhereditary) ovarian cancers. DESIGN AND SETTING Retrospective cohort study of a consecutive series of 933 ovarian cancers diagnosed and treated at our institution, which is a comprehensive cancer center as designated by the National Cancer Institute, over a 12-year period (December 1986 to August 1998). PATIENTS The study was restricted to patients of Jewish origin because of the ease of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotyping in this ethnic group. From the 189 patients who identified themselves as Jewish, 88 hereditary cases were identified with the presence of a germline founder mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The remaining 101 cases from the same series not associated with a BRCA mutation and 2 additional groups (Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 52 and 111) with ovarian cancer from clinical trials (for the survival analysis) were included for comparison. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Age at diagnosis, surgical stage, histologic cell type and grade, and surgical outcome; and response to chemotherapy and survival for advanced-stage (II and IV) cases. RESULTS Hereditary cancers were rarely diagnosed before age 40 years and were common after age 60 years, with mean age at diagnosis being significantly younger for BRCA1- vs BRCA2-linked patients (54 vs 62 years; P =. 04). Histology, grade, stage, and success of cytoreductive surgery were similar for hereditary and sporadic cases. The hereditary group had a longer disease-free interval following primary chemotherapy in comparison with the nonhereditary group, with a median time to recurrence of 14 months and 7 months, respectively (P <. 001). Those with hereditary cancers had improved survival compared with the nonhereditary group (P =. 004). For stage III cancers, BRCA mutation status was an independent prognostic variable (P =. 03). CONCLUSIONS Although BRCA-associated hereditary ovarian cancers in this population have surgical and pathological characteristics similar to those of sporadic cancers, advanced-stage hereditary cancer patients survive longer than nonhereditary cancer patients. Age penetrance is greater for BRCA1-linked than for BRCA2-linked cancers in this population.
COUP transcription factor is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily.
CRK protein, together with GRB2/ASH and Nck proteins, belongs to the adaptor-type Src homology (SH)2-containing molecules, which transduce signals from tyrosine kinases. Here another guanine nucleotide-releasing protein (GNRP), C3G, has been identified as a CRK SH3-binding protein. The nucleotide sequence of a 4.1-kb C3G cDNA contains a 3.2-kb open reading frame encoding a 121-kDa protein, and antibodies against C3G have been shown to detect a protein of 130-140 kDa. The carboxyl terminus of C3G has a peptide sequence homologous to GNRPs for Ras, and the expression of this carboxyl terminus region suppresses the loss of CDC25 function in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The C3G protein expressed in Escherichia coli binds to CRK and GRB2/ASH proteins. Mutational analysis of C3G assigns the SH3 binding region to a 50-amino acid region containing a proline-rich sequence. The mRNAs of both the C3G and CRK proteins are expressed ubiquitously in human adult and fetal tissues. The results of these studies suggest that the complex of CRK and C3G, or GRB2/ASH and C3G, may transduce the signals from tyrosine kinases to Ras in a number of different tissues.
CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), which is known to be expressed predominately on memory and activated T lymphocytes, is a receptor for both interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible protein 10 (gamma IP-10) and monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig). We report the novel finding that CXCR3 is also expressed on CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors from human cord blood stimulated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) but not on freshly isolated CD34(+) progenitors. Freshly isolated CD34(+) progenitors expressed low levels of CXCR3 messenger RNA, but this expression was highly up-regulated by GM-CSF, as indicated by a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique. gamma IP-10 and Mig induced chemotaxis of GM-CSF-stimulated CD34(+) progenitors by means of CXCR3, since an anti-CXCR3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was found to block gamma IP-10-induced and Mig-induced CD34(+) progenitor chemotaxis. These chemotactic attracted CD34(+) progenitors are colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage. gamma IP-10 and Mig also induced GM-CSF-stimulated CD34(+) progenitor adhesion and aggregation by means of CXCR3, a finding confirmed by the observation that anti-CXCR3 mAb blocked these functions of gammaIP-10 and Mig but not of chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha. gamma IP-10-induced and Mig-induced up-regulation of integrins (CD49a and CD49b) was found to play a crucial role in adhesion of GM-CSF-stimulated CD34(+) progenitors. Moreover, gamma IP-10 and Mig stimulated CXCR3 redistribution and cellular polarization in GM-CSF-stimulated CD34(+) progenitors. These results indicate that CXCR3-gamma IP-10 and CXCR3-Mig receptor-ligand pairs, as well as the effects of GM-CSF on them, may be especially important in the cytokine/chemokine environment for the physiologic and pathophysiologic events of differentiation of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors into lymphoid and myeloid stem cells, subsequently immune and inflammatory cells. These processes include transmigration, relocation, differentiation, and maturation of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors. (Blood. 2000;96:1230-1238)

Calcineurin (CaN) is a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein serine/threonine phosphate which is critical for several important cellular processes, including T-cell activation. CaN is the target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506, which inhibit CaN after forming complexes with cytoplasmic binding proteins (cyclophilin and FKBP12, respectively). We report here the crystal structures of full-length human CaN at 2.1 A resolution and of the complex of human CaN with FKBP12-FK506 at 3.5 A resolution. In the native CaN structure, an auto-inhibitory element binds at the Zn/Fe-containing active site. The metal-site geometry and active-site water structure suggest a catalytic mechanism involving nucleophilic attack on the substrate phosphate by a metal-activated water molecule. In the FKBP12-FK506-CaN complex, the auto-inhibitory element is displaced from the active site. The site of binding of FKBP12-FK506 appears to be shared by other non-competitive inhibitors of calcineurin, including a natural anchoring protein.
Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, have been available for almost 20 years. Although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression, they are associated with acute and chronic nephrotoxicity. Acute nephrotoxicity, which occurs in the early period after transplantation, leads to a higher rate of dialysis, and chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result in graft loss. Acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases. Two recently available immunosuppressive agents, mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus (rapamycin), have no nephrotoxicity. The use of these drugs in combination with other agents has led to the development of new paradigms of immunosuppressive therapy. This paper reviews the results of clinical trials that have investigated these new approaches to immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.
Calcineurin-inhibitor induced pain syndrome (CIPS): a severe disabling complication after organ transplantation.
Calcineurin-inhibitor therapy can lead to renal dysfunction in heart transplantation patients. The novel immunosuppressive (IS) drug sirolmus (Srl) lacks nephrotoxic effects; however, proteinuria associated with Srl has been reported following renal transplantation. In cardiac transplantation, the incidence of proteinuria associated with Srl is unknown. In this study, long-term cardiac transplant patients were switched from cyclosporine to Srl-based IS. Concomitant IS consisted of mycophenolate mofetil +/- steroids. Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0.13 g/day (range 0-5.7) preswitch to 0.23 g/day (0-9.88) at 24 months postswitch (p = 0.0024). Before the switch, 11.5% of patients had high-grade proteinuria (>1.0 g/day); this increased to 22.9% postswitch (p = 0.006). ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-releasing blocker (ARB) therapy reduced proteinuria development. Patients without proteinuria had increased renal function (median 42.5 vs. 64.1, p = 0.25), whereas patients who developed high-grade proteinuria showed decreased renal function at the end of follow-up (median 39.6 vs. 29.2, p = 0.125). Thus, proteinuria may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to Srl, which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients. Srl should be used with ACEi/ARB therapy and patients monitored for proteinuria and increased renal dysfunction.
Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels during nitric oxide-induced headache in patients with chronic tension-type headache.
Calcitonin receptors are found in the brain, and intracerebral infusions of calcitonin can produce behavioral effects. Among these behavioral effects are decreases in food intake and decreases in amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. In previous experiments we found that decreases in food intake were induced by local administration of calcitonin into several hypothalamic sites and into the nucleus accumbens. In the present experiment calcitonin decreased locomotor activity when locally injected into the same sites where it decreases food intake. The areas where calcitonin is most effective in decreasing locomotor activity are located in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens, suggesting that these areas are the major sites of action of calcitonin in inhibiting amphetamine-induced locomotor activity.
Calcium carbonate toxicity: the updated milk-alkali syndrome; report of 3 cases and review of the literature.
Caltractin, a 20-kDa calcium-binding protein, was previously purified and cloned at the DNA level from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas. It is a structural component of the basal body complex, the major microtubule-organizing center in Chlamydomonas and the functional homolog of the centrosome in the animal cell. Here we report the characterization of a cDNA encoding a human caltractin that shares a high degree of amino acid identity (70%) with its algal counterpart. Caltractin was identified in both HeLa and BHK cells as a 21-kDa polypeptide specifically localized to the centrosome of interphase and mitotic cells. The high level of conservation in the amino acid sequence of caltractin from algae to humans and its association with the major microtubule-organizing center in the cell suggest that caltractin plays a fundamental role in microtubule-organizing center structure and function.

Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by the deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA). Sixty-four probands were analyzed for mutations in the ASPA gene. Three point mutations--693C-- > A, 854A-- > C, and 914C-- > A--were identified in the coding sequence. The 693C-- > A and 914C-- > A base changes, resulting in nonsense tyr231-- > ter and missense ala305-- > glu mutations, respectively, lead to complete loss of ASPA activity in in vitro expression studies. The 854A-- > C transversion converted glu to ala in codon 285. The glu285-- > ala mutant ASPA has 2. 5% of the activity expressed by the wild-type enzyme. A fourth mutation, 433 --2 (A-- > G) transition, was identified at the splice-acceptor site in intron 2. The splice-site mutation would lead to skipping of exon 3, accompanied by a frameshift, and thus would produce aberrant ASPA. Of the 128 unrelated Canavan chromosomes analyzed, 88 were from probands of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The glu285-- > ala mutation was predominant (82. 9%) in this population, followed by the tyr231-- > ter (14. 8%) and 433 --2 (A-- > G) (1. 1%) mutations. The three mutations account for 98. 8% of the Canavan chromosomes of Ashkenazi Jewish origin. The ala305-- > glu mutation was found exclusively in non-Jewish probands of European descent and constituted 60% of the 40 mutant chromosomes. Predominant occurrence of certain mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish and non-Jewish patients with Canavan disease would suggest a founding-father effect in propagation of these mutant chromosomes
Canavan disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait that is caused by the deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA). The majority of patients with Canavan disease are from an Ashkenazi Jewish background. Mutations in ASPA that lead to loss of enzymatic activity have been identified, and E285A and Y231X are the two predominant mutations that account for 97% of the mutant chromosomes in Ashkenazi Jewish patients. The current study was aimed at finding the molecular basis of Canavan disease in 25 independent patients of non-Jewish background. Eight novel and three previously characterized mutations accounted for 80% (40/50) of mutant chromosomes. The A305E missense mutation accounted for 48% (24/50) of mutant chromosomes in patients of western European descent, while the two predominant Jewish mutations each accounted for a single mutant chromosome. The eight novel mutations identified included 1- and 4-bp deletions (32 deltaT and 876 deltaAGAA, respectively) and I16T, G27R, D114E, G123E, C152Y, and R168C missense mutations. The homozygous 32 deltaT deletion was identified in the only known patient of African-American origin with Canavan disease. The heterozygosity for 876 deltaAGAA mutation was identified in three independent patients from England. Six single-base changes leading to missense mutations were identified in patients from Turkey (D114E, R168C), The Netherlands (I16T), Germany (G27R), Ireland (C152Y), and Canada (G123E). A PCR-based protocol is described that was used to introduce mutations in wild-type cDNA. In vitro expression of mutant cDNA clones demonstrated that all of these mutations led to a deficiency of ASPA and should therefore result in Canavan disease..
Canavan disease, or spongy degeneration of the brain, is a severe leukodystrophy caused by the deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA). Recently, a missense mutation was identified in human ASPA coding sequence from patients with Canavan disease. The human ASPA gene has been cloned and found to span 29 kb of the genome. Human aspartoacylase is coded by six exons intervened by five introns. The exons vary from 94 (exon III) to 514 (exon VI) bases. The exon/intron splice junction sites follow the gt/ag consensus sequence rule. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from human/mouse somatic cell hybrid cell lines localized ASPA to human chromosome 17. The human ASPA locus was further mapped in the 17p13-ter region by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The bovine aspa gene has also been cloned, and its exon/intron organization is identical to that of the human gene. The 500-base sequence upstream of the initiator ATG codon in the human gene and that in the bovine gene are 77% identical. Human ASPA coding sequences cross-hybridize with genomic DNA from yeast, chicken, rabbit, cow, dog, mouse, rat, and monkey. The specificity of cross-species hybridization of coding sequences suggests that aspartoacylase has been conserved during evolution. It should now be possible to identify mutations in the noncoding genomic sequences that lead to Canavan disease and to study the regulation of ASPA..

Cancer incidence and metolachlor use in the Agricultural Health Study: An update.
Cancer patients who have been treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy have described experiencing deteriorations in cognition. A widely used chemotherapeutic agent, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and so could have a direct effect on brain function. In particular this anti mitotic drug could reduce cell proliferation in the neurogenic regions of the adult brain. In contrast reports indicate that hippocampal dependent neurogenesis and cognition are enhanced by the SSRI antidepressant Fluoxetine. In this investigation the behavioural effects of chronic (two week) treatment with 5-FU and (three weeks) with Fluoxetine either separately or in combination with 5-FU were tested on adult Lister hooded rats. Behavioural effects were tested using a context dependent conditioned emotional response test (CER) which showed that animals treated with 5-FU had a significant reduction in freezing time compared to controls. A separate group of animals was tested using a hippocampal dependent spatial working memory test, the object location recognition test (OLR). Animals treated only with 5-FU showed significant deficits in their ability to carry out the OLR task but co administration of Fluoxetine improved their performance. 5-FU chemotherapy caused a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus compared to controls. This reduction was eliminated when Fluoxetine was co administered with 5-FU. Fluoxetine on its own had no effect on proliferating cell number or behaviour. These findings suggest that 5-FU can negatively affect both cell proliferation and hippocampal dependent working memory and that these deficits can be reversed by the simultaneous administration of the antidepressant Fluoxetine.
Cap structures are added cotranscriptionally to all RNA polymerase II transcripts. They affect several processes including RNA stability, pre-messenger RNA splicing, RNA export from the nucleus and translation initiation. The effect of the cap on translation is mediated by the initiation factor eIF-4F, whereas the effect on pre-mRNA splicing involves a nuclear complex (CBC) composed of two cap binding proteins, CBP80 and CBP20. A role for CBC in the nuclear export of capped RNAs has also been proposed. We report here the characterization of human and Xenopus CBP20s. Antibodies against recombinant CBP20 prevent interaction of CBC with capped RNAs in vitro. Following microinjection into Xenopus oocytes, the antibodies inhibit both pre-mRNA splicing and export of U small nuclear RNAs to the cytoplasm. These results demonstrate that CBC mediates the effect of the cap structure in U snRNA export, and provide direct evidence for the involvement of a cellular RNA-binding factor in the transport of RNA to the cytoplasm.

Carbamazepine and vigabatrin are contraindicated in typical absence seizures. Of 18 consecutive referrals of children with resistant typical absences only, eight were erroneously treated with carbamazepine either as monotherapy or as an add-on. Vigabatrin was also used in the treatment of two children. Frequency of absences increased in four children treated with carbamazepine and two of these developed myoclonic jerks, which resolved on withdrawal of carbamazepine. Absences were aggravated in both cases where vigabatrin was added on to concurrent treatment. Optimal control of the absences was achieved with sodium valproate, lamotrigine, or ethosuximide alone or in combination.
Carbamazepine was switched to its 10-keto analogue oxcarbazepine among six difficult-to-treat schizophrenic or organic psychotic patients using concomitantly haloperidol, chlorpromazine or clozapine. This change resulted within 2-4 weeks in the 50-200% increase in the plasma levels of these neuroleptics and the appearance of extrapyramidal symptoms. None of the patients showed any clinical deteriotation during the following 3-6 months. The results of this case report support the idea that in contrast with carbamazepine oxcarbazepine does not induce the hepatic microsomal enzyme systems regulating the inactivation of antipsychotic drugs.
Carbamazepine-induced cardiac dysfunction. Characterization of two distinct clinical syndromes.
Carbimazole induced ANCA positive vasculitis.
Carbonic anhydrase V (CA V) is expressed in mitochondrial matrix in liver and several other tissues. It is of interest for its putative roles in providing bicarbonate to carbamoyl phosphate synthetase for ureagenesis and to pyruvate carboxylase for gluconeogenesis and its possible importance in explaining certain inherited metabolic disorders with hyperammonemia and hypoglycemia. Following the recent characterization of the cDNA for human CA V, we report the isolation of the human gene from two lambda genomic libraries and its characterization. The CA V gene (CA5) is approximately 50 kb long and contains 7 exons and 6 introns. The exon-intron boundaries are found in positions identical to those determined for the previously described CA II, CA III, and CA VII genes. Like the CA VII gene, CA5 does not contain typical TATA and CAAT promoter elements in the 5' flanking region but does contain a TTTAA sequence 147 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. CA5 also contains a 12-bp GT-rich segment beginning 13 bp downstream of the polyadenylation signal in the 3' untranslated region of exon 7. FISH analysis allowed CA5 to be assigned to chromosome 16q24.3. An unprocessed pseudogene containing sequence homologous to exons 3-7 and introns 3-6 was also isolated and was assigned by FISH analysis to chromosome 16p11.2-p12.
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can cause nephrolithiasis. We studied 20 patients receiving long-term carbonic anhydrase inhibitor treatment for periodic paralysis and myotonia. Three patients on acetazolamide (15%) developed renal calculi. Extracorporeal lithotripsy successfully removed a renal calculus in one patient and surgery removed a staghorn calculus in another, permitting continued treatment. Renal function remained normal in all patients. Nephrolithiasis is a complication of acetazolamide but does not preclude its use.
Carboplatin has been reported to cause acute renal failure when administered in high doses to adult patients. We report a 4 1/2-year-old girl who was treated with high-dose carboplatin for metastatic parameningeal embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Acute renal failure developed followed by a slow partial recovery of renal function. Possible contributing factors are discussed.

Cardiac arrhythmias cause 400 000 sudden deaths annually in the United States alone. Mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A on chromosome 3p21 cause cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. In this study, we define an SCN5A mutation, S1103Y, in a white family associated with syncope, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden death. A very recent study reported the same mutation in 13.2% of African Americans, but not in the white population. Our study shows that mutation S1103Y does exist in the white population, and it is associated with a considerable risk of syncope, ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden death in this population.
Cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory failure. The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized. The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid-base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs. The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. During the infusion of aminophylline, the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen (PO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were kept within normal limits. When respiratory failure was produced by hypoventilation (pH 7.05 to 7.25; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg: P02 20 to 40 mm Hg), infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level. These experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in respiratory failure, pharmacologic agents, particularly aminophylline, may play a significant role.
Cardiac function was assessed in long-term survivors of malignant bone tumors who were treated according to Rosen's T5 or T10 protocol, both including doxorubicin. Thirty-one patients, age 10-45 years (median age 17.8 years) were evaluated 2.3-14.1 years (median 8.9 years) following completion of treatment. Cumulative doses of doxorubicin were 225-550 mg/m2 (median dose 360). The evaluation consisted of a history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), signal averaged ECG, 24-hour ambulatory ECG, echocardiography and radionuclide angiography. Eighteen of 31 (58%) patients showed cardiac toxicity, defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities: late potentials, complex ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular dilation, decreased shortening fraction, or decreased ejection fraction. The incidence of cardiac abnormalities increased with length of follow-up (P< or = .05). No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of doxorubicin and cardiac status, except for heart rate variability. When adjusted to body surface area, the left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW index) was decreased in all patients. The incidence of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is high and increases with follow-up, irrespective of cumulative dose. Life-long cardiac follow-up in these patients is warranted. The results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and LVPW index could be sensitive indicators for cardiotoxicity.
Cardiac symptoms, including hypotension, developed in three patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma while being treated with cisplatin (CDDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In two patients, hypotension was associated with severe left ventricular dysfunction. All three patients required therapy discontinuation. Cardiac enzymes remained normal despite transient electrocardiographic (EKG) changes. The presentation and cardiac evaluation (hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and scintigraphic) of these patients suggest new manifestations of 5-FU cardiotoxicity that may be influenced by CDDP. The possible pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed.
Cardiac toxicity is a major complication which limits the use of adriamycin as a chemotherapeutic agent. Cardiomyopathy is frequent when the total dose exceeds 600 mg/m2 and occurs within one to six months after cessation of therapy. A patient is reported who developed progressive cardiomyopathy two and one-half years after receiving 580 mg/m2 which apparently represents late, late cardiotoxicity.

Cardioprotective effect of ethanolic extract of Terminalia chebula fruits (500 mg/kg body wt) was examined in isoproterenol (200 mg/kg body wt) induced myocardial damage in rats. In isoproterenol administered rats, the level of lipid peroxides increased significantly in the serum and heart. A significant decrease was observed in the activity of the myocardial marker enzymes with a concomitant increase in their activity in serum. Histopathological examination was carried out to confirm the myocardial necrosis. T. chebula extract pretreatment was found to ameliorate the effect of isoproterenol on lipid peroxide formation and retained the activities of the diagnostic marker enzymes.

Cardiotoxicity is a rare complication occurring during 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment for malignancies. We herein report the case of a 70-year-old man with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, in whom a high serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) was observed. The patient, who had unresectable colon cancer metastases to the liver and lung, was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital; he had no cardiac history. After admission, the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU (1000 mg/day), during which precordial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with a high serum FBAL concentration of 1955 ng/ml. Both the precordial pain and the electrocardiographic changes disappeared spontaneously after the discontinuation of 5-FU. As the precordial pain in this patient was considered to have been due to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, the administration of 5-FU was abandoned. Instead, oral administration of S-1 (a derivative of 5-FU), at 200 mg/day twice a week, was instituted, because S-1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the degradative of 5-FU into FBAL. The serum FBAL concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng/ml, the same as the value measured on the first day of S-1 administration. Thereafter, no cardiac symptoms were observed. The patient achieved a partial response 6 months after the initiation of the S-1 treatment. The experience of this case, together with a review of the literature, suggests that FBAL is related to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity. S-1 may be administered safely to patients with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the major health problem of advanced as well as developing countries of the world. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of the Solidago virgaurea extract on isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. The subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (30 mg/kg) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h, for two consecutive days, led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, total cholesterol, triglycerides, free serum fatty acid, cardiac tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with S. virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg/kg followed by isoproterenol injection significantly prevented the observed alterations. Captopril (50 mg/kg/day, given orally), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug, was used as a positive control in this study. The data of the present study suggest that S. virgaurea extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing MDA level and increasing the antioxidant status in isoproterenol-treated rats. The study emphasizes the beneficial action of S. virgaurea extract as a cardioprotective agent.

Cases of delayed hemolytic anemia have been described after treatment with injectable artesunate, the current World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended first-line drug for the treatment of severe malaria. A total of 350 patients (215 [61.4%] < 5 years of age and 135 [38.6%] > 5 years of age) were followed-up after treatment with injectable artesunate for severe malaria in hospitals and health centers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Complete series of hemoglobin (Hb) measurements were available for 201 patients. A decrease in Hb levels between 2 and 5 g/dL was detected in 23 (11.4%) patients during the follow-up period. For five patients, Hb levels decreased below 5 g/dL during at least one follow-up visit. All cases of delayed anemia were clinically manageable and resolved within one month.
Catalepsy induced by combinations of ketamine and morphine: potentiation, antagonism, tolerance and cross-tolerance in the rat.
Catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy due to chronic excess of endogenous catecholamines has been recognized for decades as a clinical phenomenon. In contrast, reports of myocardial dysfunction due to acute iatrogenic overdose are rare. A 35-year-old woman whose cervix uteri was inadvertently injected with 8 mg of epinephrine developed myocardial stunning that was characterized by severe hemodynamic compromise, profound, albeit transient, left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and only modestly elevated biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis. Our case illustrates the serious consequences of medical errors that can be avoided through improved medication labeling and staff supervision.

Cause of death among patients with Parkinson's disease: a rare mortality due to cerebral haemorrhage.
Causes of acute thrombotic microangiopathy in patients receiving kidney transplantation.
Causes of death, with special reference to cerebral haemorrhage, among 240 patients with pathologically verified Parkinson's disease were investigated using the Annuals of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan from 1981 to 1985. The leading causes of death were pneumonia and bronchitis (44.1%), malignant neoplasms (11.6%), heart diseases (4.1%), cerebral infarction (3.7%) and septicaemia (3.3%). Cerebral haemorrhage was the 11th most frequent cause of death, accounting for only 0.8% of deaths among the patients, whereas it was the 5th most common cause of death among the Japanese general population in 1985. The low incidence of cerebral haemorrhage as a cause of death in patients with Parkinson's disease may reflect the hypotensive effect of levodopa and a hypotensive mechanism due to reduced noradrenaline levels in the parkinsonian brain.

Cells can release membrane components in a soluble form and as membrane vesicles. L1, an important molecule for cell migration of neural and tumor cells, is released by membrane-proximal cleavage, and soluble L1 promotes cell migration. Release of L1 is enhanced by shedding inducers such as phorbol ester and pervanadate, but it is also enhanced by depletion of cellular cholesterol with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD). How such different compounds can induce shedding is presently unknown. We show here that ADAM10 is involved in L1 cleavage, which occurs at the cell surface and in the Golgi apparatus. MCD and pervanadate treatment induced the release of microvesicles containing full-length L1 and the active form of ADAM10. L1 cleavage occurred in isolated vesicles. L1-containing microvesicles could trigger haptotactic cell migration. Only the neural L1 form carrying the RSLE signal for clathrin-dependent endocytosis was recruited and cleaved in vesicles. Phorbol ester treatment activated L1 cleavage predominantly at the cell surface. Our results provide evidence for two pathways of L1 cleavage, based on ADAM10 localization, that can be activated differentially: 1) direct cleavage at the cell surface, and 2) release and cleavage in secretory vesicles most likely derived from the Golgi apparatus. The findings establish a novel role for ADAM10 as a vesicle-based protease.
Cellular disintegrins are a family of proteins that are related to snake venom integrin ligands and metalloproteases. We have cloned and sequenced the mouse and human homologue of a widely expressed cellular disintegrin, which we have termed MDC9 (for metalloprotease/disintegrin/cysteine-rich protein 9). The deduced mouse and human protein sequences are 82% identical. MDC9 contains several distinct protein domains: a signal sequence is followed by a prodomain and a domain with sequence similarity to snake venom metalloproteases, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region, an EGF repeat, a membrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail of MDC9 has two proline-rich sequences which can bind the SH3 domain of Src, and may therefore function as SH3 ligand domains. Western blot analysis shows that MDC9 is an approximately 84-kD glycoprotein in all mouse tissues examined, and in NIH 3T3 fibroblast and C2C12 myoblast mouse cell lines. MDC9 can be both cell surface biotinylated and 125I-labeled in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, indicating that the protein is present on the plasma membrane. Expression of MDC9 in COS-7 cells yields an 84-kD protein, and immunofluorescence analysis of COS-7 cells expressing MDC9 shows a staining pattern that is consistent with a plasma membrane localization. The apparent molecular mass of 84 kD suggests that MDC9 contains a membrane-anchored metalloprotease and disintegrin domain. We propose that MDC9 might function as a membrane-anchored integrin ligand or metalloprotease, or that MDC9 may combine both activities in one protein.
Cellular mechanisms which account for disruption the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension are not clear. The goal of this study was to determine the role of synthesis/release of bradykinin to activate B2 receptors in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was quantitated by clearance of fluorescent-labeled dextran before and during phenylephrine-induced acute hypertension in rats treated with vehicle and Hoe-140 (0.1 microM). Phenylephrine infusion increased arterial pressure, arteriolar diameter and clearance of fluorescent dextran by a similar magnitude in both groups. These findings suggest that disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension is not related to the synthesis/release of bradykinin to activate B2 receptors.

Central nervous system (CNS) complications during treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remain a challenging clinical problem. Outcome improvement with more intensive chemotherapy has significantly increased the incidence and severity of adverse events. This study analyzed the incidence of neurological complications during ALL treatment in a single pediatric institution, focusing on clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological findings. Exclusion criteria included CNS leukemic infiltration at diagnosis, therapy-related peripheral neuropathy, late-onset encephalopathy, or long-term neurocognitive defects. During a 9-year period, we retrospectively collected 27 neurological events (11%) in as many patients, from 253 children enrolled in the ALL front-line protocol. CNS complications included posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (n = 10), stroke (n = 5), temporal lobe epilepsy (n = 2), high-dose methotrexate toxicity (n = 2), syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (n = 1), and other unclassified events (n = 7). In conclusion, CNS complications are frequent events during ALL therapy, and require rapid detection and prompt treatment to limit permanent damage.

Centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are one of several pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of spasticity related to disorders of the central nervous system. In addition to their effects on spasticity, certain adverse cardiorespiratory effects have been reported. Adults chronically treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may have a limited ability to respond to hypotension when the sympathetic response is simultaneously blocked. The authors present a 10-year-old boy chronically treated with lisinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, to control hypertension who developed hypotension following the addition of tizanidine, an alpha-2 agonist, for the treatment of spasticity. The possible interaction of tizanidine and other antihypertensive agents should be kept in mind when prescribing therapy to treat either hypertension or spasticity in such patients.

Cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic disturbances in man, the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized. There is a need for a well-defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied. In four subacute toxicity studies, the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose-dependent incidence of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia after 1-3 months of treatment. A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400-500 mg/kg cefonicid or 540-840 mg/kg cefazedone. All three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment; the time required for recovery of the erythron (approximately 1 month) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets (hours to a few days). Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin, the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested; cefonicid (but not cefazedone)-treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period (15 +/- 5 days) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug (61 +/- 24 days). This observation, along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs, suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia. We conclude that the administration of high doses of cefonicid or cefazedone to dogs can induce hematotoxicity similar to the cephalosporin-induced blood dyscrasias described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders.

Cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were measured during isoflurane-induced hypotension in 10 patients subjected to craniotomy for clipping of a cerebral aneurysm. Flow and metabolism were measured 5-13 days after the subarachnoid haemorrhage by a modification of the classical Kety-Schmidt technique using xenon-133 i.v. Anaesthesia was maintained with an inspired isoflurane concentration of 0.75% (plus 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen), during which CBF and CMRO2 were 34.3 +/- 2.1 ml/100 g min-1 and 2.32 +/- 0.16 ml/100 g min-1 at PaCO2 4.1 +/- 0.1 kPa (mean +/- SEM). Controlled hypotension to an average MAP of 50-55 mm Hg was induced by increasing the dose of isoflurane, and maintained at an inspired concentration of 2.2 +/- 0.2%. This resulted in a significant decrease in CMRO2 (to 1.73 +/- 0.16 ml/100 g min-1), while CBF was unchanged. After the clipping of the aneurysm the isoflurane concentration was reduced to 0.75%. There was a significant increase in CBF, although CMRO2 was unchanged, compared with pre-hypotensive values. These changes might offer protection to brain tissue during periods of induced hypotension.

Changes in intragastric pressure after the administration of suxamethonium 1.5 mg kg-1 i.v. were studied in 32 children (mean age 6.9 yr) pretreated with either physiological saline or alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1. The incidence and intensity of muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium were significantly greater in the control than in the alfentanil group. The intragastric pressure during muscle fasciculations was significantly higher in the control group (16 +/- 0.7 (SEM) cm H2O) than in the alfentanil group (7.7 +/- 1.5 (SEM) cm H2O). The increase in intragastric pressure was directly related to the intensity of muscle fasciculations (regression line: y = 0.5 + 4.78x with r of 0.78). It is concluded that intragastric pressure increases significantly during muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium in healthy children. Alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1 effectively inhibits the incidence and intensity of suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations; moreover, intragastric pressure remains at its control value.

Children who have status epilepticus have continuous or rapidly repeating seizures that may be life-threatening and may cause life-long changes in brain and behavior. The extent to which status epilepticus causes deficits in auditory discrimination is unknown. A naturalistic auditory location discrimination method was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of status epilepticus. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day (P) 20, or a convulsant dose of pilocarpine on P20 or P45. Pilocarpine on either day induced status epilepticus; status epilepticus at P45 resulted in CA3 cell loss and spontaneous seizures, whereas P20 rats had no cell loss or spontaneous seizures. Mature rats were trained with sound-source location and sound-silence discriminations. Control (saline P20) rats acquired both discriminations immediately. In status epilepticus (P20) rats, acquisition of the sound-source location discrimination was moderately impaired. Status epilepticus (P45) rats failed to acquire either sound-source location or sound-silence discriminations. Status epilepticus in rat causes an age-dependent, long-term impairment in auditory discrimination. This impairment may explain one cause of impaired auditory location discrimination in humans.
Chimeric transcription factors, created by gene fusions as the result of chromosomal translocations, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several pathologically disparate solid tumors. The PAX3/FKHR fusion gene, formed by a t (2; 13) (q35; q14) in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, encodes a hybrid protein that contains both PAX3 DNA binding domains, the paired box and homeodomain, linked to the bisected DNA binding domain of FKHR, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. Here we report that PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR display similar, but not identical transactivation activities when tested with model Pax recognition sequences. No functional role could be ascribed solely to the residual FKHR binding domain present in the fusion protein, but FKHR was found to contribute a strong carboxyl terminal activation domain replacing the one located in the unrearranged PAX3 gene. We show that the native PAX3/FKHR protein present in tumor cells with this translocation has transcriptional characteristics similar to the in vitro expressed protein. The ability of the PAX3/FKHR hybrid protein to bind DNA in a sequence specific manner and to transactivate the expression of artificial reporter genes suggests that its aberrant expression could subvert the transcriptional programs that normally control the growth, differentiation, and survival of primitive myogenic precursors in vivo..
Chinese herbal medicine preparations are widely available and often regarded by the public as natural and safe remedies for a variety of medical conditions. Nephropathy caused by Chinese herbs has previously been reported, usually involving the use of aristolochic acids. We report a 23-year-old woman who developed acute renal failure following prolonged use of a proprietary Chinese herbal slimming pill that contained anthraquinone derivatives, extracted from Rhizoma Rhei (rhubarb). The renal injury was probably aggravated by the concomitant intake of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac. Renal pathology was that of hypocellular interstitial fibrosis. Spontaneous renal recovery occurred upon cessation of the slimming pills, but mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was still evident histologically 4 months later. Although a causal relationship between the use of an anthraquinone-containing herbal agent and renal injury remains to be proven, phytotherapy-associated interstitial nephropathy should be considered in patients who present with unexplained renal failure.
Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) is a metabolite of the alkylating agent ifosfamide (IFO) and putatively responsible for renal damage following anti-tumor therapy with IFO. Depletion of sulfhydryl (SH) groups has been reported from cell culture, animal and clinical studies. In this work the effect of CAA on human proximal tubule cells in primary culture (hRPTEC) was investigated. Toxicity of CAA was determined by protein content, cell number, LDH release, trypan blue exclusion assay and caspase-3 activity. Free thiols were measured by the method of Ellman. CAA reduced hRPTEC cell number and protein, induced a loss in free intracellular thiols and an increase in necrosis markers. CAA but not acrolein inhibited the cysteine proteases caspase-3, caspase-8 and cathepsin B. Caspase activation by cisplatin was inhibited by CAA. In cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes, CAA induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal leakage. The effects of CAA on cysteine protease activities and thiols could be reproduced in cell lysate. Acidification, which slowed the reaction of CAA with thiol donors, could also attenuate effects of CAA on necrosis markers, thiol depletion and cysteine protease inhibition in living cells. Thus, CAA directly reacts with cellular protein and non-protein thiols, mediating its toxicity on hRPTEC. This effect can be reduced by acidification. Therefore, urinary acidification could be an option to prevent IFO nephropathy in patients.

Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8), which is a typical brain-gut peptide, exerts a wide range of biological activities on the central nervous system.

Here, we investigated the effects of CCK-8 on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the lateral perforant path (LPP)-granule cell synapse of rat dentate gyrus (DG) in acute saline or morphine-treated rats. Population spikes (PS), which were evoked by stimulation of the LPP, were recorded in the DG region. Acute morphine (30mg/kg, s.c.) treatment significantly attenuated hippocampal LTP and CCK-8 (1ug, i.c.v.) restored the amplitude of PS that was attenuated by morphine injection. Furthermore, microinjection of CCK-8 (0.1 and 1ug, i.c.v.) also significantly augmented hippocampal LTP in saline-treated (1ml/kg, s.c.) rats. Pre-treatment of the CCK2 receptor antagonist L-365,260 (10ug, i.c.v) reversed the effects of CCK-8, but the CCK1 receptor antagonist L-364,718 (10ug, i.c.v) did not. The present results demonstrate that CCK-8 attenuates the effect of morphine on hippocampal LTP through CCK2 receptors and suggest an ameliorative function of CCK-8 on morphine-induced memory impairment.

Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transfers cholesteryl ester from high density lipoprotein (HDL) to apo B-containing lipoproteins. The hyperalphalipoproteinemia caused by CETP deficiency is fairly common in Japan and one of the most common mutations in the CETP gene is the splicing defect of the intron 14, the allelic frequency of which has been shown to be 0. 0049 in the Japanese general population. Recently, we have reported a missense mutation in exon 15 of the CETP gene (442D G), showing a dominant effect on the CETP activity and HDL-cholesterol level. In the current study, we determined the frequency of this new mutation in Japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic (HDL-cholesterol > or = 100 mg/dl) subjects. A rapid and easy screening method for this new mutation was developed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -mediated site-directed mutagenesis. Among 117 Japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic subjects (HDL-cholesterol; 116. 7 +/- 16. 5 mg/dl, mean +/- S. D.) without the intron 14 splice defect, three homozygotes (2. 5%) and 34 heterozygotes (29. 1%) were found to have the 442D G mutation. The relative allelic frequency of this mutation was calculated to be 0. 17. One of the homozygotes for the 442D G mutation was the patient previously described by us as having hyperalphalipoproteinemia with corneal opacity and coronary heart disease. This was the first reported subject homozygous for the CETP deficiency who also demonstrated atherosclerotic symptoms. In homozygous subjects, CETP activity ranged from 37% to 62% of the normal value, which was consistent with the results obtained from the transient expression experiment previously reported; however, the specific activity of CETP was not as low as expected.

Chordin is a key developmental protein that dorsalizes early vertebrate embryonic tissues by binding to ventralizing TGF-beta-like bone morphogenetic proteins and sequestering them in latent complexes. Here we report the first characterization of mammalian chordin. The full-length cDNA sequence for mouse chordin is given, and RNA blot analysis shows the murine chordin gene Chrd to be expressed at relatively high levels in 7-day postcoitum mouse embryos and at much decreased levels at later developmental times and in adult tissues. These results imply a major role for chordin during gastrulation of the mammalian embryo. Nevertheless, both murine and human chordin genes are shown to be expressed at readily detectable levels in several fetal and adult tissues, most notably liver and cerebellum, suggesting additional roles in organogenesis and homeostasis. Chrd was mapped to mouse chromosome 16 using interspecific crosses, and the cognate human gene CHRD was localized to human chromosome 3q27 by radiation hybrid mapping. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

Choreatiform hyperkinesias are known to be occasional movement abnormalities during intoxications with cocaine but not opiates. This is a case report of euphoria and choreoathetoid movements both transiently induced by rapid adjustment to the selective mu-opioid receptor agonist methadone in an inpatient previously abusing heroine and cocaine. In addition, minor EEG abnormalities occurred. Possible underlying neurobiological phenomena are discussed.

Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked progressive degeneration of the choroid and retina. 12% of unrelated male patients carry deletions of the partially cloned CHM gene. In Finland, there are more than 120 living CHM patients belonging to eight apparently unrelated pedigrees. Molecular deletions involving the CHM gene have been detected in three families. We have screened the remaining five families for point mutations. In one large family a single nucleotide (T) insertion into the donor splice site of exon C leads to two aberrantly spliced mRNAs both producing a premature stop codon. The mutation can be assayed easily by amplification and digestion with Msel. Our findings provide additional evidence for the pathogenetic role of CHM mutations and provide a diagnostic tool for one fifth of the worlds known CHM patients..

Chromosomal locations of the Atm (ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) -mutated) and Acat1 (mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase) genes in mouse, rat, and Syrian hamster were determined by direct R-banding FISH. Both genes were colocalized to the C-D band of mouse chromosome 9, the proximal end of q24. 1 of rat chromosome 8, and qa4-qa5 of Syrian hamster chromosome 12. The regions in the mouse and rat were homologous to human chromosome 11q. Fine genetic linkage mapping of the mouse AT region was performed using the interspecific backcross mice. Atm, Acat1, and Npat, which is a new gene isolated from the AT region, and 12 flanking microsatellite DNA markers were examined. No recombinations were found among the Atm, Npat, Acat1, and D9Mit6 loci, and these loci were mapped 2. 0 cM distal to D9Mit99 and 1. 3 cM proximal to D9Mit102. Comparison of the linkage map of mouse chromosome 9 (MMU9) and that of human chromosome 11 (HSA11) indicates that there is a chromosomal rearrangement due to an inversion between Ets1 and Atm-Npat-Acat1 and that the inversion of MMU9 originated from the chromosomal breakage at the boundary between Gria4 and Atm-Npat-Acat1 on HSA11. This type of inversion appeared to be conserved in the three rodent species, mouse, rat, and Syrian hamster, using additional comparative mapping data with the Rck gene
Chromosomal studies were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from five Israeli-Moroccan families with ataxia-telangiectasia. A total of 24 individuals, including seven propositi, was investigated. Among the probands, significantly elevated rates of chromosome damage were observed in both blood and skin. Skin fibroblasts of affected individuals showed several orders of magnitude more chromosome breakage than lymphocytes. Increased rates of chromosome damage were also observed in the fibroblasts of some phenotypically normal family members (obligate heterozygotes and sibs) when compared to normal controls. An apparent abnormal clone of cells, possessing a large acrocentric marker chromosome (14q +), was observed in varying proportions among cells of all the propositi (2-5% of lymphocytes; 1-9% of fibroblasts)..
Chromosomal translocations identified in hematopoietic and solid tumors result in deregulated expression of protooncogenes or creation of chimeric proteins with tumorigenic potential. In the pediatric solid tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a consistent t (2; 13) (q35; q14) or variant t (1; 13) (p36; q14) translocation generates PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins, respectively. In this report, we demonstrate that in addition to functional alterations these translocations are associated with fusion product overexpression. Furthermore, PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR overexpression occurs by distinct mechanisms. Transcription of PAX3-FKHR is increased relative to wild-type PAX3 by a copy number-independent process. In contrast, PAX7-FKHR overexpression results from fusion gene amplification. Thus, gene-specific mechanisms were selected to overexpress PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, presumably due to differences in regulation between the wild-type loci. We postulate that these overexpression mechanisms ensure a critical level of gene product for the oncogenic effects of these fusions..
Chromosomal translocations in human lipomas frequently create fusion transcripts encoding high mobility group (HMG) I-C DNA-binding domains and C-terminal sequences from different presumed transcription factors, suggesting a potential role for HMG I-C in the development of lipomas. To evaluate the role of the HMG I-C component, the three DNA-binding domains of HMG I-C have now been expressed in transgenic mice. Despite the ubiquitous expression of the truncated HMG I-C protein, the transgenic mice develop a selective abundance of fat tissue early in life, show marked adipose tissue inflammation, and have an abnormally high incidence of lipomas. These findings demonstrate that the DNA-binding domains of HMG I-C, in the absence of a C-terminal fusion partner, are sufficient to perturb adipogenesis and predispose to lipomas. We provide data supporting the central utility of this animal model as a tool to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of one of the most common kind of human benign tumors..

Chromosome translocations involving 11p13 have been associated with familial aniridia in two kindreds highlighting the chromosomal localization of the AN2 locus. This locus is also part of the WAGR complex (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation). In one kindred, the translocation is associated with a deletion, and probes for this region were used to identify and clone the breakpoints of the translocation in the second kindred. Comparison of phage restriction maps exclude the presence of any sizable deletion in this case. Sequences at the chromosome 11 breakpoint are conserved in multiple species, suggesting that the translocation falls within the AN2 gene..
Chronic active hepatitis associated with diclofenac sodium therapy.
Chronic administration of estrogen to the Fischer 344 (F344) rat induces growth of large, hemorrhagic pituitary tumors. Ten weeks of diethylstilbestrol (DES) treatment caused female F344 rat pituitaries to grow to an average of 109.2 +/- 6.3 mg (mean +/- SE) versus 11.3 +/- 1.4 mg for untreated rats, and to become highly hemorrhagic. The same DES treatment produced no significant growth (8.9 +/- 0.5 mg for treated females versus 8.7 +/- 1.1 for untreated females) or morphological changes in Brown Norway (BN) rat pituitaries. An F1 hybrid of F344 and BN exhibited significant pituitary growth after 10 weeks of DES treatment with an average mass of 26.3 +/- 0.7 mg compared with 8.6 +/- 0.9 mg for untreated rats. Surprisingly, the F1 hybrid tumors were not hemorrhagic and had hemoglobin content and outward appearance identical to that of BN. Expression of both growth and morphological changes is due to multiple genes. However, while DES-induced pituitary growth exhibited quantitative, additive inheritance, the hemorrhagic phenotype exhibited recessive, epistatic inheritance. Only 5 of the 160 F2 pituitaries exhibited the hemorrhagic phenotype; 36 of the 160 F2 pituitaries were in the F344 range of mass, but 31 of these were not hemorrhagic, indicating that the hemorrhagic phenotype is not merely a consequence of extensive growth. The hemorrhagic F2 pituitaries were all among the most massive, indicating that some of the genes regulate both phenotypes.

Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease. The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose-limiting hemolytic anemia. Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin-induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders. In general, anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life. Although ribavirin-associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage ribavirin-associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages. Viramidine, a liver-targeting prodrug of ribavirin, has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of ribavirin while decreasing the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

Chronic pulsatile levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. We studied the prevalence and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic Malaysian patients with PD. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 95 patients with PD on uninterrupted levodopa therapy for at least 6 months. The instrument used was the UPDRS questionnaires. The predictors of dyskinesia were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 65.6 + 8.5 years. The mean onset age was 58.5 + 9.8 years. The median disease duration was 6 (7) years. Dyskinesia was present in 44% (n = 42) with median levodopa therapy of 3 years. There were 64.3% Chinese, 31% Malays, and 3.7% Indians and other ethnic groups. Eighty-one percent of patients with dyskinesia had clinical fluctuations. Patients with dyskinesia had lower onset age ( p < 0.001), longer duration of levodopa therapy ( p < 0.001), longer disease duration ( p < 0.001), higher total daily levodopa dose ( p < 0.001), and higher total UPDRS scores ( p = 0.005) than patients without dyskinesia. The three significant predictors of dyskinesia were duration of levodopa therapy, onset age, and total daily levodopa dose. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in our patients was 44%. The most significant predictors were duration of levodopa therapy, total daily levodopa dose, and onset age.
Chronic treatment with metformin suppresses toll-like receptor 4 signaling and attenuates left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction.
Cimetidine, a histamine 2 (H2) antagonist, produces a decrease in arterial pressure due to vasodilatation, especially in critically ill patients. This may be because cimetidine acts as a histamine agonist. We, therefore, investigated the effects of the histamine 1(H1) receptor antagonist, diphenhydramine, on the haemodynamic changes observed after cimetidine in ICU patients. Each patient was studied on two separate days. In a random fashion, they received cimetidine 200 mg iv on one day, and on the other, a pretreatment of diphenhydramine 40 mg iv with cimetidine 200 mg iv. In the non-pretreatment group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased from 107.4 +/- 8.4 mmHg to 86.7 +/- 11.4 mmHg (P less than 0.01) two minutes after cimetidine. Also, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased during the eight-minute observation period (P less than 0.01). In contrast, in the pretreatment group, little haemodynamic change was seen. We conclude that an H1 antagonist may be useful in preventing hypotension caused by iv cimetidine, since the vasodilating activity of cimetidine is mediated, in part, through the H1 receptor.
Ciprofloxacin has been associated with several side effects including interstitial nephritis and hemolytic anemia. The combination of both side effects is extremely rare. In this report, we describe a case of ciprofloxacin-induced interstitial nephritis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia improved after stopping the drug and initiation of steroid therapy. Unfortunately, acute interstitial nephritis was irreversible and the patient developed end-stage renal disease.

Cisapride, a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate, is widely prescribed for the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders. Prolongation of QT interval, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents, but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem, an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension. The patient was in near syncope and had QT-interval prolongation. After discontinuing cisapride, the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur. We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including diltiazem.
Cisplatin treatment has been adopted in some chemotherapies; however, this drug can induce acute kidney injury due its ability to negatively affect renal function, augment serum levels of creatinine and urea, increase the acute tubular necrosis score and up-regulate cytokines (e.g., IL-1b and TNF-a). The kinin B2 receptor has been associated with the inflammation process, as well as the regulation of cytokine expression, and its deletion resulted in an improvement in the diabetic nephropathy status. To examine the role of the kinin B2 receptor in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury, kinin B2 receptor knockout mice were challenged with cisplatin. Additionally, WT mice were treated with a B2 receptor antagonist after cisplatin administration. B2 receptor-deficient mice were less sensitive to this drug than the WT mice, as shown by reduced weight loss, better preservation of kidney function, down regulation of inflammatory cytokines and less acute tubular necrosis. Moreover, treatment with the kinin B2 receptor antagonist effectively reduced the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea after cisplatin administration. Thus, our data suggest that the kinin B2 receptor is involved in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury by mediating the necrotic process and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, thus resulting in declined renal function. These results highlight the kinin B2 receptor antagonist treatment in amelioration of nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin therapy.
Clarithromycin is a relatively new macrolide antibiotic that offers twice-daily dosing. It differs from erythromycin only in the methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 6. Although the side-effect profile of erythromycin is established, including gastroenteritis and interactions with other drugs subject to hepatic mixed-function oxidase metabolism, experience with the newer macrolides is still being recorded. Cardiotoxicity has been demonstrated after both intravenous and oral administration of erythromycin but has never been reported with the newer macrolides. We report a case of ventricular dysrhythmias that occurred after six therapeutic doses of clarithromycin. The dysrhythmias resolved after discontinuation of the drug.
Clarithromycin is the most documented cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor to cause an adverse interaction with simvastatin. This particular case is of interest as rhabdomyolysis only occurred after an increase in the dose of clarithromycin. The patient developed raised cardiac biomarkers without any obvious cardiac issues, a phenomenon that has been linked to rhabdomyolysis previously. To date, there has been no reported effect of rhabdomyolysis on the structure and function of cardiac muscle. Clinicians need to be aware of prescribing concomitant medications that increase the risk of myopathy or inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme. Our case suggests that troponin elevation could be associated with statin induced rhabdomyolysis, which may warrant further studies.

Classic (complete) lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency and Fish-eye disease (partial LCAT deficiency) are genetic syndromes associated with markedly decreased plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol but not with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We investigated the metabolism of the HDL apolipoproteins (apo) apoA-I and apoA-II in a total of five patients with LCAT deficiency, one with classic LCAT deficiency and four with Fish-eye disease. Plasma levels of apoA-II were decreased to a proportionately greater extent (23% of normal) than apoA-I (30% of normal). In addition, plasma concentrations of HDL particles containing both apoA-I and apoA-II (LpA-I A-II) were much lower (18% of normal) than those of particles containing only apoA-I (LpA-I) (51% of normal). The metabolic basis for the low levels of apoA-II and LpA-I A-II was investigated in all five patients using both exogenous radiotracer and endogenous stable isotope labeling techniques. The mean plasma residence time of apoA-I was decreased at 2. 08 +/- 0. 27 d (controls 4. 74 +/- 0. 65 days); however, the residence time of apoA-II was even shorter at 1. 66 +/- 0. 24 d (controls 5. 25 +/- 0. 61 d). In addition, the catabolism of apoA-I in LpA-I A-II was substantially faster than that of apoA-I in LpA-I. In summary, genetic syndromes of either complete or partial LCAT deficiency result in low levels of HDL through preferential hypercatabolism of apoA-II and HDL particles containing apoA-II. Because LpA-I has been proposed to be more protective than LpA-I A-II against atherosclerosis, this selective effect on the metabolism of LpA-I A-II may provide a potential explanation why patients with classic LCAT deficiency and Fish-eye disease are not at increased risk for premature atherosclerosis despite markedly decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and apoA-I
Classical Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). We isolated several mutant PAH cDNA clones from a PKU carrier individual and showed that they contained an internal 116 base pair deletion, corresponding precisely to exon 12 of the human chromosomal PAH gene. The deletion causes the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal 52 amino acids. Gene transfer and expression studies using the mutant PAH cDNA indicated that the deletion abolishes PAH activity in the cell as a result of protein instability. To determine the molecular basis of the deletion, the mutant chromosomal PAH gene was isolated from this individual and shown to contain a GT-- greater than AT substitution at the 5 splice donor site of intron 12. Thus, the consequence of the splice donor site mutation in the human liver is the skipping of the preceding exon during RNA splicing..
Classical familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a high-penetrance autosomal dominant disease that predisposes to hundreds or thousands of colorectal adenomas and carcinoma and that results from truncating mutations in the APC gene. A variant of FAP is attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli, which results from germ-line mutations in the 5 and 3 regions of the APC gene. Attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli patients have " multiple " colorectal adenomas (typically fewer than 100) without the florid phenotype of classical FAP. Another group of patients with multiple adenomas has no mutations in the APC gene, and their phenotype probably results from variation at a locus, or loci, elsewhere in the genome. Recently, however, a missense variant of APC (I1307K) was described that confers an increased risk of colorectal tumors, including multiple adenomas, in Ashkenazim. We have studied a set of 164 patients with multiple colorectal adenomas and/or carcinoma and analyzed codons 1263-1377 (exon 15G) of the APC gene for germ-line variants. Three patients with the I1307K allele were detected, each of Ashkenazi descent. Four patients had a germ-line E1317Q missense variant of APC that was not present in controls; one of these individuals had an unusually large number of metaplastic polyps of the colorectum. There is increasing evidence that there exist germ-line variants of the APC gene that predispose to the development of multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinoma, but without the florid phenotype of classical FAP, and possibly with importance for colorectal cancer risk in the general population..
Classical galactosemia and mutations at the galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) gene.
Classical galactosemia is caused by a deficiency in activity of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT), which, in turn, is caused by mutations at the GALT gene. The disorder exhibits considerable allelic heterogeneity and, at the end of 1998, more than 150 different base changes were recorded in 24 different populations and ethnic groups in 15 countries worldwide. The mutations most frequently cited are Q188R, K285N, S135L, and N314D. Q188R is the most common mutation in European populations or in those predominantly of European descent. Overall, it accounts for 60-70% of mutant chromosomes, but there are significant differences in its relative frequency in individual populations. Individuals homoallelic for Q188R tend to have a severe phenotype and this is in keeping with the virtually complete loss of enzyme activity observed in in vitro expression systems. Globally, K285N is rarer, but in many European populations it can be found on 25-40% of mutant chromosomes. It is invariably associated with a severe phenotype. S135L is found almost exclusively in African Americans. In vitro expression results are discrepant, but some individuals carrying S135L appear to exhibit GALT activity in some tissues. Duarte 1 (or Los Angeles) and Duarte 2 (or Duarte) variants carry the same amino acid substitution, N314D, even though D1 is associated with increased erythrocyte GALT activity and D2 with reduced activity. N314D is in linkage disequilibrium with other base changes that differ on the D1 and D2 alleles. N314D does not impair GALT activity in in vitro expression systems. However, there are differences in the abundance of GALT protein in lymphoblastoid cells lines from D2 and D1 individuals. It is unclear whether the specific molecular changes that distinguish the D1 and D2 alleles account for the different activities. The considerable genetic heterogeneity documented to date undoubtedly contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity that is observed in galactosemia. The additional effects of nonallelic variation and other constitutional factors on phenotypic variability remain to be elucidated..
Classical galactosemia is caused by one common missense mutation (Q188R) and by several rare mutations in the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) gene. The most common variant of GALT, the Duarte variant, occurs as two types, Duarte-1 (D-1) and Duarte-2 (D-2), both of which carry the sequence change N314D. D-1 increases, whereas D-2 decreases GALT activity. To study the molecular genetics of classical and Duarte galactosemia, we analyzed the GALT mutations in 30 families with classical galactosemia, in 10 families with the D-2 variant and in 3 individuals carrying the D-1 allele by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE detected 59 of the 60 classical galactosemia alleles. Q188R accounted for 60%, K285N accounted for 28% of these alleles. Eight novel candidate galactosemia mutations were found. On all D-2 alleles N314D occurred in cis with two intronic sequence changes, on the D-1 alleles in cis with a neutral mutation in exon 7. We conclude that the mutations causing galactosemia are highly heterogeneous and that K285N is a second common galactosemia mutation in our population..
Classical phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Limitations of the current dietary treatment for PKU have led to the development of potential treatments based on somatic gene transfer. Three different vector systems have been examined. Vectors derived from a recombinant retrovirus or a DNA/protein complex can efficiently transduce the PAH cDNA into PAH-deficient hepatocytes in vitro, but the application of these vector systems is presently limited by their low transduction efficiency in vivo. In contrast, a vector derived from a recombinant adenovirus can restore 10% -80% of normal hepatic PAH activity into PAH-deficient mice, which completely normalizes serum phenylalanine levels. This treatment is transient and cannot be effectively re-administered due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies directed against the recombinant adenoviral vector. However, these findings suggest that PKU can be completely corrected by somatic gene therapy, and provide some direction for the future development of adenoviral vectors..
Classical phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The abolition of an invariant BamHI site located in the coding sequence of the PAH gene (exon 7) led to the recognition of two new point mutations at codon 272 and 273 (272gly----stop and 273ser----phe, respectively). Both mutations were detected in north eastern France or Belgium and occurred on the background of RFLP haplotype 7 alleles. The present study supports the view that the clinical heterogeneity in PKU is accounted for by the large variety of mutant genotypes associated with PAH deficiencies..
Cleavage of huntingtin by apopain, a proapoptotic cysteine protease, is modulated by the polyglutamine tract.
Clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which cocaine may result in acute myocardial infarction. In individuals with preexisting, high-grade coronary arterial narrowing, acute myocardial infarction may result from an increase in myocardial oxygen demand associated with cocaine-induced increase in rate-pressure product. In other individuals with no underlying atherosclerotic obstruction, coronary occlusion may be due to spasm, thrombus, or both. With regard to spasm, the clinical findings are largely circumstantial, and the locus of cocaine-induced vasoconstriction remains speculative. Although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that spasm involves the epicardial, medium-size vessels, other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction. Diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental, discrete infarction. Whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha-mediated, other in vitro data suggest the opposite. The finding of cocaine-induced vasoconstriction in segments of (noninnervated) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha-mediated effects. Finally, the contribution of a primary, thrombotic effect of cocaine has not been excluded.

Clinical use of the anthracycline doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by its cardiotoxic effects, which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis. To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) during the development of DOX cardiomyopathy, we studied B1R knockout mice (B1R(-/-)) by investigating cardiac inflammation and apoptosis after induction of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. DOX control mice showed cardiac dysfunction measured by pressure-volume loops in vivo. This was associated with a reduced activation state of AKT, as well as an increased bax/bcl2 ratio in Western blots, indicating cardiac apoptosis. Furthermore, mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue. In DOX B1R(-/-) mice, cardiac dysfunction was improved compared to DOX control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax/bcl-2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as AKT activation state. These findings suggest that B1R is detrimental in DOX cardiomyopathy in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis. These insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing B1R antagonists for treatment of human DOX cardiomyopathy.
Clinically reversible veno-occlusive disease of the liver developed in a 23-year-old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia after 10 months of maintenance therapy with 6-thioguanine. Serial liver biopsies showed the development and resolution of intense sinusoidal engorgement. Although this disease was clinically reversible, some subintimal fibrosis about the terminal hepatic veins persisted. This case presented a unique opportunity to observe the histologic features of clinically reversible hepatic veno-occlusive disease over time, and may be the first case of veno-occlusive related solely to 6-thioguanine.

Clonidine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: II. ECG changes and adverse events analysis.
Clonidine is a frequently administered alpha2-adrenergic agonist which can decrease heart rate and blood pressure. We present a case of a 5-year-old child with cerebral palsy and seizure disorder, receiving clonidine for restlessness, who presented for placement of a baclofen pump. Without the knowledge of the medical personnel, the patient's mother administered three doses of clonidine during the evening before and morning of surgery to reduce anxiety. During induction of anesthesia, the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension requiring cardiac resuscitation. There are no previous reports of clonidine-associated cardiac arrest in a child undergoing induction of anesthesia.

Close linkage between HL-A and C2 deficiency was first reported by FU and co-workers in 1974. We present here a pedigree of a 31-year-old C2-deficient individual with clinical manifestations of Hodgkins disease. The following markers were tested C2 levels, factor B polymorphism, blood groups, and enzyme typing. In addition to close linkage between HL-A and C2 deficiency, both parents were heterozygous for Bf (HL-A linked, electrophoretic variation of B). The two HL-A haplotypes closely linked to C2 deficiency are different 2, W18 and W24, W18. They share, however, the SD2 antigen W18 and the LD type 7a..
Clotiazepam-induced acute hepatitis.
Cluster headache is characterized by typical autonomic dysfunctions including facial and intracranial vascular disturbances. Both the trigeminal and the cranial parasympathetic systems may be involved in mediating these dysfunctions. An experimental model was developed in the rat to measure changes in lacrimation and intracranial blood flow following noxious chemical stimulation of facial mucosa. Blood flow was monitored in arteries of the exposed cranial dura mater and the parietal cortex using laser Doppler flowmetry. Capsaicin (0.01-1 mm) applied to oral or nasal mucosa induced increases in dural and cortical blood flow and provoked lacrimation. These responses were blocked by systemic pre-administration of hexamethonium chloride (20 mg/kg). The evoked increases in dural blood flow were also abolished by topical pre-administration of atropine (1 mm) and [Lys1, Pro2,5, Arg3,4, Tyr6]-VIP (0.1 mm), a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) antagonist, onto the exposed dura mater. We conclude that noxious stimulation of facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow and lacrimation via a trigemino-parasympathetic reflex. The blood flow responses seem to be mediated by the release of acetylcholine and VIP within the meninges. Similar mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of cluster headache.

Coats disease is characterized by abnormal retinal vascular development (so-called retinal telangiectasis) which results in massive intraretinal and subretinal lipid accumulation (exudative retinal detachment). The classical form of Coats disease is almost invariably isolated, unilateral and seen in males. A female with a unilateral variant of Coats disease gave birth to a son affected by Norrie disease. Both carried a missense mutation within the NDP gene on chromosome Xp11. 2 2. Subsequently analysis of the retinas of nine enucleated eyes from males with Coats disease demonstrated in one a somatic mutation in the NDP gene which was not present within non-retinal tissue. We suggest that Coats telangiectasis is secondary to somatic mutation in the NDP gene which results in a deficiency of norrin (the protein product of the NDP gene) within the developing retina. This supports recent observations that the protein is critical for normal retinal vasculogenesis.

Cocaine causes memory and learning impairments in rats: involvement of nuclear factor kappa B and oxidative stress, and prevention by topiramate.
Cocaine induced myocardial ischemia.
Cocaine is a risk factor for both ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke. We present the case of a 31-year-old man with bilateral ischemia of the globus pallidus after excessive alcohol and intranasal cocaine use. Drug-related globus pallidus infarctions are most often associated with heroin. Bilateral basal ganglia infarcts after the use of cocaine, without concurrent heroin use, have never been reported. In our patient, transient cardiac arrhythmia or respiratory dysfunction related to cocaine and/or ethanol use were the most likely causes of cerebral hypoperfusion.
Cocaine related chest pain: are we seeing the tip of an iceberg?
Cocaine's ability to interact with sigma receptors suggests that these proteins mediate some of its behavioral effects. Therefore, three novel sigma receptor ligands with antagonist activity were evaluated in Swiss Webster mice: BD1018 (3S-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane), BD1063 (1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine), and LR132 (1R,2S-(+)-cis-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexylamine). Competition binding assays demonstrated that all three compounds have high affinities for sigma1 receptors. The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for dopamine, opioid, GABA(A) and NMDA receptors. In behavioral studies, pre-treatment of mice with BD1018, BD1063, or LR132 significantly attenuated cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality. Moreover, post-treatment with LR132 prevented cocaine-induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals. In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists, the well-characterized sigma receptor agonist di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) and the novel sigma receptor agonist BD1031 (3R-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane) each worsened the behavioral toxicity of cocaine. At doses where alone, they produced no significant effects on locomotion, BD1018, BD1063 and LR132 significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine. To further validate the hypothesis that the anti-cocaine effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors, an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine. Together, the data suggests that functional antagonism of sigma receptors is capable of attenuating a number of cocaine-induced behaviors.

Cognitive deterioration from long-term abuse of dextromethorphan: a case report.
Cognitive impairment, the most common and severe comorbidity of epilepsy, greatly diminishes the quality of life. However, current therapeutic interventions for epilepsy can also cause untoward cognitive effects. Thus, there is an urgent need for new kinds of agents targeting both seizures and cognition deficits. Oxidative stress is considered to play an important role in epileptogenesis and cognitive deficits, and antioxidants have a putative antiepileptic potential. Metformin, the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic oral drug, has antioxidant properties. This study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of metformin on seizures, cognitive impairment and brain oxidative stress markers observed in pentylenetetrazole-induced kindling animals. Male C57BL/6 mice were administered with subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole (37 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for 14 injections. Metformin was injected intraperitoneally in dose of 200mg/kg along with alternate-day PTZ. We found that metformin suppressed the progression of kindling, ameliorated the cognitive impairment and decreased brain oxidative stress. Thus the present study concluded that metformin may be a potential agent for the treatment of epilepsy as well as a protective medicine against cognitive impairment induced by seizures.
Cohen syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with variability in the clinical manifestations, characterized by developmental delay, visual disability, facial dysmorphisms and intermittent neutropenia. We described a cohort of 10 patients affected by Cohen syndrome from nine Italian families ranging from 5 to 52 years at assessment. Characteristic age related facial changes were well documented. Visual anomalies, namely retinopathy and myopia, were present in 9/10 patients (retinopathy in 9/10 and myopia in 8/10). Truncal obesity has been described in all patients older than 6 years (8/8). DNA samples from all patients were analyzed for mutations in COH1 by DHPLC. We detected 15 COH1 alterations most of them were truncating mutations, only one being a missense change. Partial gene deletions have been found in two families. Most mutations were private. Two were already reported in the literature just once. A single base deletion leading to p.T3708fs3769, never reported before, was found in three apparently unrelated families deriving from a restricted area of the Veneto's lowland, between Padova town and Tagliamento river, in heterozygous state. Given the geographical conformation of this region, which is neither geographically or culturally isolated, a recent origin of the mutation could be hypothesized.

Combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-induced hypotension and haemodilution on hepatic function were studied in 30 patients undergoing hip surgery. The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups; those in group A (n = 10) were subjected to controlled hypotension alone, those in group B (n = 10) to haemodilution alone and those in group C (n = 10) to both controlled hypotension and haemodilution. Haemodilution in groups B and C was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of dextran solution, and final haematocrit values were 21 or 22%. Controlled hypotension in groups A and C was induced with PGE1 to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 180 min. Measurements included arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR, aceto-acetate/3-hydroxybutyrate) and clinical hepatic function parameters. AKBR and biological hepatic function tests showed no change throughout the time course in groups A and B. In group C, AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min (-40%) and at 180 min (-49%) after the start of hypotension and at 60 min (-32%) after recovery of normotension, and SGOT, SGPT, LDH and total bilirubin showed significant increases after operation. The results suggest that a prolonged combination of more than 120 min of PGE1-induced hypotension and moderate haemodilution would cause impairment of hepatic function.
Combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin E1-induced hypotension and haemodilution on human hepatic function.
Combined genetic deficiency of C6 and C7 in man.
Combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) in man denotes impaired production of growth hormone (GH) and one or more of the other five anterior pituitary hormones. Mutations of the pituitary transcription factor gene POU1F1 (the human homologue of mouse Pit1) are responsible for deficiencies of GH, prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in Snell and Jackson dwarf mice and in man, while the production of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is preserved. The Ames dwarf (df) mouse displays a similar phenotype, and appears to be epistatic to Snell and Jackson dwarfism. We have recently positionally cloned the putative Ames dwarf gene Prop1, which encodes a paired-like homeodomain protein that is expressed specifically in embryonic pituitary and is necessary for Pit1 expression. In this report, we have identified four CPHD families with homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for inactivating mutations of PROP1. These mutations in the human PROP1 gene result in a gene product with reduced DNA-binding and transcriptional activation ability in comparison to the product of the murine df mutation. In contrast to individuals with POU1F1 mutations, those with PROP1 mutations cannot produce LH and FSH at a sufficient level and do not enter puberty spontaneously. Our results identify a major cause of CPHD in humans and suggest a direct or indirect role for PROP1 in the ontogenesis of pituitary gonadotropes, as well as somatotropes, lactotropes and caudomedial thyrotropes.
Combined subtotal deficiency of C6 and C7, in which both proteins are expressed at very low levels, has been observed in homozygous form in two families. A defect at the 5 splice donor site of intron 15 of the C6 gene explains the low molecular weight of the C6 protein and is probably responsible for its low expressed concentration. The C7 defect is more enigmatic the protein is of normal molecular weight, low circulating concentration, and altered isoelectric point. An Arg > Ser codon substitution in exon 11 is the only molecular alteration within the mature C7 protein. These defects are associated with a characteristic set of polymorphic DNA markers in the C6/C7 region, forming a distinct haplotype. The haplotype has been found in combination with a number of other haplotypes containing defective genes that lead either to C6 or C7 deficiency, but with different consequences. Where it is combined with a C6-deficient gene, the serum C7 levels can be surprisingly high, possibly because there is no C6 generating C56 to consume the C7. In contrast, where the C7 genes are both defective (but still partially functional), there may be a profound deficit of circulating C7 because there is ample C6 to produce C56 and consume the already small amount of C7. Each molecular defect has also been found in isolation and has the expected effect..

Comparatively little is known of the cytogenetics of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM). This is primarily due to the low proliferation of the clonal B cells, which precludes conventional karyotyping in many cases. Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene at 14q32 are characteristic of many B-cell lymphomas and myelomas. Initial reports suggested that the t(9;14) was characteristic of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (the underlying pathological diagnosis in WM), but subsequent studies have failed to confirm the uniqueness of the translocation. To clarify this, we examined 69 cases of WM with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and failed to demonstrate an IgH translocation in 67 (97%). We conclude that IGH translocations are not a feature of WM, and the implications of this finding are discussed.

Complement C7 deficiency (C7D) is associated frequently with recurrent bacterial infections, especially meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis. We report in this work the molecular bases of C7D in two unrelated Japanese males. We used exon-specific PCR/single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis as a screening step for mutations. Subsequent direct sequencing of the target exons identified homozygous mutations in exon 16 of case 1 and in exon 15 of case 2. The mutation of case 1 was a homozygous T to A transversion at nucleotide 2250, the third nucleotide of the codon TGT for Cys728, leading to a stop codon TGA (C728X). In case 2, a homozygous 2-bp deletion (2137delTG/2138delGT/2139delTG) caused a frameshift, generating a premature termination codon 4 to 6 nucleotides downstream. Family study in case 1 confirmed the genetic nature of the defect. Moreover, we detected a novel polymorphism in intron 11 that presumably is linked to the mutation responsible for C7D in case 1. Our results indicate that the pathogenesis of C7D is heterogeneous like most of the other deficiencies of complement components..
Complement C7 deficiency: seven further molecular defects and their associated marker haplotypes.
Complement component C6 deficiency (C6D) was diagnosed in a 16-year-old African-American male with meningococcal meningitis. The patients father and two brothers also had C6D, but gave no history of meningitis or other neisserial infection. By using exon-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/single-strand conformation polymorphism as a screening step and nucleotide sequencing of target exons, we determined that the proband was a compound heterozygote for two C6 gene mutations. The first, 1195delC located in exon 7, is a novel mutation, while the second, 1936delG in exon 12, has been described before to cause C6D in an unrelated African-American individual. Both mutations result in premature termination codons and C6 null alleles. Allele-specific PCR indicated that the probands two brothers also inherited the 1195delC mutation from their heterozygous mother and the 1936delG mutation from their homozygous father..

Complement factor 2 deficiency: a clinical and serological family study.
Complementary DNA clones were isolated that represent the 5 terminal 2. 5 kilobases of the murine Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Dmd) messenger RNA (mRNA). Mouse Dmd mRNA was detectable in skeletal and cardiac muscle and at a level approximately 90 percent lower in brain. Dmd mRNA is also present, but at much lower than normal levels, in both the muscle and brain of three different strains of dystrophic mdx mice. The identification of Dmd mRNA in brain raises the possibility of a relation between human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene expression and the mental retardation found in some DMD males. These results also provide evidence that the mdx mutations are allelic variants of mouse Dmd gene mutations.
Complete atrioventricular block secondary to lithium therapy.
Complete deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) causes the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Previous characterization of a mutant form of HPRT, HPRTYale, from a subject with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome revealed normal mRNA and protein concentrations, no residual catalytic activity, and cathodal migration upon PAGE. We have cloned and sequenced HPRTYale cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of full-length HPRTYale cDNA revealed a single nucleotide substitution compared with normal HPRT cDNA G----C at nucleotide position 211. This transversion predicts substitution of arginine for glycine at amino acid position 71, explaining the cathodal migration of HPRTYale. Chou-Fasman secondary structure analysis predicts a change in the probability of beta-turn formation in the region containing the mutation. Inclusion of the bulky arginine side chain in place of glycine probably disrupts protein folding as well. Cloning mutant forms of cDNA allows identification of specific mutations, provides insight into mutational mechanisms, and facilitates structure-function analysis of mutant proteins..

Complete hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT) deficiency in humans results in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome which is characterized, among other features, by compulsive self-injurious behavior. HPRT-deficient mice generated using mouse embryonic stem cells exhibit none of the behavioral symptoms associated with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Administration of drugs that inhibit adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) in HPRT-deficient mice has produced the suggestion that deficiency of APRT in combination with HPRT-deficiency in mice may lead to self-mutilation behavior [C. L. Wu and D. W. Melton (1993) Nature Genet. 3, 235-240]. To test this proposition, we bred HPRT-APRT-deficient mice. Although the doubly-deficient mice excrete adenine and its highly insoluble derivative, 2, 8-dihydroxyadenine, which are also associated with human APRT deficiency, additional abnormalities or any self-injurious behavior were not detected. Thus, APRT-HPRT-deficient mice, which are devoid of any purine salvage pathways, show no novel phenotype and are not a model for the behavioral abnormalities associated with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome as previously suggested

Concerns about long-term methotrexate (MTX) neurotoxicity in the 1990s led to modifications in intrathecal (IT) therapy, leucovorin rescue, and frequency of systemic MTX administration in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, neurocognitive outcomes and neuroradiologic evidence of leukoencephalopathy were compared in children treated with intense central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy (P9605) versus those receiving fewer CNS-directed treatment days during intensive consolidation (P9201). A total of 66 children from 16 Pediatric Oncology Group institutions with "standard-risk" acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1.00 to 9.99 years at diagnosis, without evidence of CNS leukemia at diagnosis were enrolled on ACCL0131: 28 from P9201 and 38 from P9605. Magnetic resonance imaging scans and standard neuropsychological tests were performed >2.6 years after the end of treatment. Significantly more P9605 patients developed leukoencephalopathy compared with P9201 patients (68%, 95% confidence interval 49%-83% vs. 22%, 95% confidence interval 5%-44%; P=0.001) identified as late as 7.7 years after the end of treatment. Overall, 40% of patients scored <85 on either Verbal or Performance IQ. Children on both studies had significant attention problems, but P9605 children scored below average on more neurocognitive measures than those treated on P9201 (82%, 14/17 measures vs. 24%, 4/17 measures). This supports ongoing concerns about intensive MTX exposure as a major contributor to CNS late effects.

Congenital afibrinogenemia is a rare, autosomal, recessive disorder characterized by the complete absence of detectable fibrinogen. We previously identified the first causative mutations in a nonconsanguineous Swiss family; the 4 affected persons have homozygous deletions of approximately 11 kb of the fibrinogen alpha (FGA) gene. Haplotype data implied that these deletions occurred on distinct ancestral chromosomes, suggesting that this region may be susceptible to deletion by a common mechanism. We subsequently showed that all the deletions were identical to the base pair and probably resulted from a nonhomologous recombination mediated by 7-bp direct repeats. In this study, we have collected data on 13 additional unrelated patients to identify the causative mutations and to determine the prevalence of the 11-kb deletion. A common recurrent mutation, at the donor splice site of FGA intron 4 (IVS4 + 1 G > T), accounted for 14 of the 26 (54%) alleles. One patient was heterozygous for the previously identified deletion. Three more frameshift mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, and a second splice site mutation were also identified. Consequently, 86% of afibrinogenemia alleles analyzed to date have truncating mutations of FGA, though mutations in all 3 fibrinogen genes, FGG, FGA, and FGB, might be predicted to cause congenital afibrinogenemia..
Congenital chloride diarrhea (CLD) is caused by mutations in a gene which encodes an intestinal anion transporter. We report here the complete genomic organization of the human CLD gene which spans approximately 39kb, and comprises 21 exons. All exon/intron boundaries conform to the GT/AG rule. An analysis of the putative promoter region sequence shows a putative TATA box and predicts multiple transcription factor binding sites. The genomic structure was determined using DNA from several sources including multiple large-insert libaries and genomic DNA from Finnish CLD patients and controls. Exon-specific primers developed in this study will facilitate mutation screening studies of patients with the disease. Genomic sequencing of a BAC clone H_RG364P16 revealed the presence of another, highly homologous gene 3 of the CLD gene, with a similar genomic structure, recently identified as the Pendred syndrome gene (PDS)..
Coniine, an alkaloid from Conium maculatum (poison hemlock), has been shown to be teratogenic in livestock. The major teratogenic outcome is arthrogryposis, presumably due to nicotinic receptor blockade. However, coniine has failed to produce arthrogryposis in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rabbits. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of coniine and nicotine in the developing chick. Concentrations of coniine and nicotine sulfate were 0.015%, 0.03%, 0.075%, 0.15%, 0.75%, 1.5%, 3%, and 6% and 1%, 5%, and 10%, respectively. Both compounds caused deformations and lethality in a dose-dependent manner. All concentrations of nicotine sulfate caused some lethality but a no effect level for coniine lethality was 0.75%. The deformations caused by both coniine and nicotine sulfate were excessive flexion or extension of one or more toes. No histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group; however, extensive cranial hemorrhage occurred in all nicotine sulfate-treated chicks. There was a statistically significant (P < or = 0.01) decrease in movement in coniine and nicotine sulfate treated chicks as determined by ultrasound. Control chicks were in motion an average of 33.67% of the time, while coniine-treated chicks were only moving 8.95% of a 5-min interval, and no movement was observed for nicotine sulfate treated chicks. In summary, the chick embryo provides a reliable and simple experimental animal model of coniine-induced arthrogryposis. Data from this model support a mechanism involving nicotinic receptor blockade with subsequent decreased fetal movement.

Considerable genetic heterogeneity in G6PD was found in the Bulgarian population-14 G6PD variants isolated from 117 hemizygous carriers of G6PD deficiency. Of these, G6PD Mediterranean type was a polymorphic variant and G6PD Corinth occurred with high frequency. Two new variants were identified-G6PD Rudosem and G6PD Nedelino. In a selected group of 78 subjects with clinical manifestations, four variants were established G6PD Mediterranian, G6PD Corinth, G6PD Seattle and G6PD Ohut II..
Considering the well established role of nonclassical HLA-G class I molecules in inhibiting natural killer (NK) cell function, the consequence of abnormal HLA-G expression in malignant cells should be the escape of tumors from immunosurveillance. To examine this hypothesis, we analyzed HLA-G expression and NK sensitivity in human malignant melanoma cells. Our analysis of three melanoma cell lines and ex vivo biopsy demonstrated that (i) IGR and M74 human melanoma cell lines exhibit a high level of HLA-G transcription with differential HLA-G isoform transcription and protein expression patterns, (ii) a higher level of HLA-G transcription ex vivo is detected in a skin melanoma metastasis biopsy compared with a healthy skin fragment from the same individual, and (iii) HLA-G protein isoforms other than membrane-bound HLA-G1 protect IGR from NK lysis. It thus appears of critical importance to consider the specific role of HLA-G expression in tumors in the design of future cancer immunotherapies.
Consolidation therapy for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has been widely adopted to improve treatment response following autologous stem cell transplantation. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the safety and efficacy of combination regimen of bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTD) as consolidation therapy in 24 Japanese patients with newly diagnosed MM. VTD consisted of bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m(2) and dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 35-day cycle, with daily oral thalidomide at a dose of 100 mg/day. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were documented in four and three patients (17 and 13 %), respectively, but drug dose reduction due to cytopenia was not required in any case. Peripheral neuropathy was common (63 %), but severe grade 3-4 peripheral neuropathy was not observed. Very good partial response or better response (>VGPR) rates before and after consolidation therapy were 54 and 79 %, respectively. Patients had a significant probability of improving from <VGPR before consolidation therapy to >VGPR after consolidation therapy (p = 0.041). The VTD regimen may be safe and effective as a consolidation therapy in the treatment of MM in Japanese population.
Constitutional RB1-gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma.
Constitutional mutations in the WT1 gene in patients with Denys-Drash syndrome.
Constitutional mutations of the WT1 gene, encoding a zinc-finger transcription factor involved in renal and gonadal development, are found in most patients with Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), or diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS) associated with pseudohermaphroditism and/or Wilms tumor (WT). Most mutations in DDS patients lie in exon 8 or exon 9, encoding zinc finger 2 or zinc finger 3, respectively, with a hot spot (R394W) in exon 9. We analyzed a series of 24 patients, 10 with isolated DMS (IDMS), 10 with DDS, and 4 with urogenital abnormalities and/or WT. We report WT1 heterozygous mutations in 16 patients, 4 of whom presented with IDMS. One male and two female IDMS patients with WT1 mutations underwent normal puberty. Two mutations associated with IDMS are different from those described in DDS patients. No WT1 mutations were detected in the six other IDMS patients, suggesting genetic heterogeneity of this disease. We analyzed genotype/phenotype correlations, on the basis of the constitution of a WT1 mutation database of 84 germ-line mutations, to compare the distribution and type of mutations, according to the different symptoms. This demonstrated (1) the association between mutations in exons 8 and 9 and DMS; (2) among patients with DMS, a higher frequency of exon 8 mutations among 46, XY patients with female phenotype than among 46, XY patients with sexual ambiguity or male phenotype; and (3) statistically significant evidence that mutations in exons 8 and 9 preferentially affect amino acids with different functions..

Contrary to an earlier report by Coxon, scoline pain occurs in African negroes. Its incidence was determined in a prospective study involving a total of 100 Nigerian patients (50 out-patients and 50 in-patients). About 62% of the out-patients developed scoline pain as compared with about 26% among the in-patients. The abolition of muscle fasciculations (by 0.075mg/kg dose of Fazadinium) did not influence the occurrence of scoline pain. Neither the type of induction agent (Althesin or Thiopentone) nor the salt preparation of suxamethonium used (chloride or bromide), affected the incidence of scoline pain.

Coproporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.3) catalyzes the sixth step in the heme biosynthetic pathway, the oxidation of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX. The activity of this enzyme is deficient in the disease hereditary coproporphyria. The sequence of the cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence of the human coproporphyrinogen oxidase are presented. The human protein sequence contains a region completely homologous to that we obtained by sequencing an 11-amino acid peptide fragment from purified murine liver coproporphyrinogen oxidase. Results of Southern blotting were consistent with the presence of a single human coproporphyrinogen oxidase gene, and Northern blotting demonstrated one transcript of similar size in erythroid and nonerythroid cell lines. Expression of the cDNA coding for the putative mature human coproporphyrinogen oxidase in Escherichia coli resulted in a 17-fold increase in coproporphyrinogen activity over endogenous activity.
Corneal ulcers associated with aerosolized crack cocaine use.
Coronary aneurysm after implantation of a paclitaxel-eluting stent.
Coronary blood flow, cardiac work and metabolism were studied in dogs under sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and trimetaphan (TMP) deliberate hypotension (20% and 40% mean pressure decrease from baseline). Regarding the effects of drug-induced hypotension on coronary blood flow, aortic and coronary sinus metabolic data (pH, pO2, pCO2) we could confirm that nitroprusside hypotension could be safely used to 30% mean blood pressure decrease from control, trimetaphan hypotension to 20% mean blood pressure decrease. Cardiac work was significantly reduced during SNP hypotension. Myocardial O2 consumption and O2 availability were directly dependent on the coronary perfusion. Careful invasive monitoring of the blood pressure, blood gases and of the ECG ST-T segment is mandatory.

Cortical dysplasia is a malformation characterized by defects in proliferation, migration and maturation. This study was designed to evaluate the alterations in offspring rat cerebellum induced by maternal exposure to carmustine-[1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosoure] (BCNU) and to investigate the effects of exogenous melatonin upon cerebellar BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia, using histological and biochemical analyses. Pregnant Wistar rats were assigned to five groups: intact-control, saline-control, melatonin-treated, BCNU-exposed and BCNU-exposed plus melatonin. Rats were exposed to BCNU on embryonic day 15 and melatonin was given until delivery. Immuno/histochemistry and electron microscopy were carried out on the offspring cerebellum, and levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase were determined. Histopathologically, typical findings were observed in the cerebella from the control groups, but the findings consistent with early embryonic development were noted in BCNU-exposed cortical dysplasia group. There was a marked increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells and nestin positive cells in BCNU-exposed group, but a decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin and transforming growth factor beta1 was observed, indicating a delayed maturation, and melatonin significantly reversed these changes. Malondialdehyde level in BCNU-exposed group was higher than those in control groups and melatonin decreased malondialdehyde levels in BCNU group (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the superoxide dismutase levels between these groups. These data suggest that exposure of animals to BCNU during pregnancy leads to delayed maturation of offspring cerebellum and melatonin protects the cerebellum against the effects of BCNU.

Corticosteroid pharmacogenetics: association of sequence variants in CRHR1 with improved lung function in asthmatics treated with inhaled corticosteroids.
Corticosteroids mediate a variety of immunological actions and are commonly utilized in the treatment of a wide range of diseases. Unfortunately, therapy with this class of medications is associated with a large proportion of non-responders and significant side effects. Inhaled corticosteroids are the most commonly used asthma controller therapy. However, asthmatic response to corticosteroids also varies widely between individuals. We investigated the genetic contribution to the variation in response to inhaled corticosteroid therapy in asthma. The association of longitudinal change in lung function and single nucleotide polymorphisms from candidate genes crucial to the biologic actions of corticosteroids were evaluated in three independent asthmatic clinical trial populations utilizing inhaled corticosteroids as the primary therapy in at least one treatment arm. Variation in one gene, corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) was consistently associated with enhanced response to therapy in each of our three populations. Individuals homozygous for the variants of interest manifested a doubling to quadrupling of the lung function response to corticosteroids compared with lack of the variants (P-values ranging from 0.006 to 0.025 for our three asthmatic populations). As the primary receptor mediating the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone, which regulates endogenous cortisol levels, CRHR1 plays a pivotal, pleiotropic role in steroid biology. These data indicate that genetic variants in CRHR1 have pharmacogenetic effects influencing asthmatic response to corticosteroids, provide a rationale for predicting therapeutic response in asthma and other corticosteroid-treated diseases, and suggests this gene pathway as a potential novel therapeutic target.

Current estimates suggest that between 0.4% and 8.3% of children and adolescents are affected by major depression. We report a favorable response to treatment with citalopram by a 15-year-old boy with major depression who exhibited palpebral twitching during his first 2 weeks of treatment. This may have been a side effect of citalopram as it remitted with redistribution of doses.
Current evidence suggests that aniridia (absence of iris) is caused by loss of function of one copy of the PAX6 gene, which maps to 11p13. We present the further characterisation of two aniridia pedigrees in which the disease segregates with chromosomal rearrangements which involve 11p13 but do not disrupt the PAX6 gene. We have isolated three human YAC clones which encompass the PAX6 locus and we have used these to show that in both cases the chromosomal breakpoint is at least 85 kb distal of the 3 end of PAX6. In addition, the open reading frame of PAX6 is apparently free of mutations. We propose that the PAX6 gene on the rearranged chromosome 11 is in an inappropriate chromatin environment for normal expression and therefore that a position effect is the underlying mechanism of disease in these families..
Cutaneous and ocular pigmentation were evaluated in 29 individuals with the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Criteria for hypopigmentation included the presence of type I or II skin, the lightest skin type in the family by history, and iris translucency on globe transillumination. On the basis of these criteria, 48% of the PWS individuals were hypopigmented. The presence of hypopigmentation correlated with a small interstitial deletion on the proximal long arm of chromosome 15; however, this deletion was also found in individuals who did not meet the full criteria for hypopigmentation. Hairbulb tyrosinase activity and glutathione content, as well as urine cysteinyldopa excretion, were low in PWS individuals with and without hypopigmentation and did not separate these two groups. We conclude that hypopigmentation is found in a significant proportion of individuals with PWS and that the hypopigmentation may be associated with a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15. The mechanism for the hypopigmentation is unknown..

Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are positive regulators of cell proliferation, whereas Cdk inhibitors (CKIs) inhibit proliferation. We describe a new CKI, p57KIP2, which is related to p21CIP1 and p27KIP1. p57KIP2 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of several G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes, and its binding is cyclin dependent. Unlike CIP1, KIP2 is not regulated by p53. Overexpression of p57KIP2 arrests cells in G1. p57KIP2 proteins have a complex structure. Mouse p57KIP2 consists of four structurally distinct domains: an amino-terminal Cdk inhibitory domain, a proline-rich domain, an acidic-repeat region, and a carboxy-terminal domain conserved with p27KIP1. Human p57KIP2 appears to have conserved the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains but has replaced the internal regions with sequences containing proline-alanine repeats. In situ hybridization during mouse embryogenesis revealed that KIP2 mRNA displays a striking pattern of expression during development, showing high level expression in skeletal muscle, brain, heart, lungs, and eye. Most of the KIP2-expressing cells are terminally differentiated, suggesting that p57KIP2 is involved in decisions to exit the cell cycle during development and differentiation. Human KIP2 is located at 11p15.5, a region implicated in both sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a familial cancer syndrome, marking it as a candidate tumor suppressor. The discovery of a new member of the p21CIP1 inhibitor family with novel structural features and expression patterns suggests a complex role for these proteins in cell cycle control and development.
Cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (Cdk5) depends on the association with neuronal Cdk5 activator (Nck5a) for kinase activity. A variety of cellular proteins have been shown to undergo high affinity association with Nck5a, including three novel proteins, C42, C48, and C53 found by a yeast two-hybrid screen (Ching, Y. P., Qi, Z., and Wang, J. H. (2000) Gene 242, 285-294). The three proteins show competitive binding to Nck5a suggesting that they bind at a common site. The binding site has been mapped to a region of 26 amino acid residues (residues 145 to 170) at the N-terminal boundary of the kinase activation domain of Nck5a. This region of Nck5a contains an amphipathic alpha-helix whose hydrophobic face is involved in Cdk5 activation (Chin, K. T., Ohki, S, Tang, D., Cheng, H. C., Wang, J. H. , and Zhang, M. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 7120-7127). Several lines of evidence suggest that Nck5a interacts with the binding proteins at the hydrophilic face of the amphipathic alpha-helix. First, the Nck5a-(145-170) peptide can bind Cdk5 and Nck5a-binding proteins simultaneously. Second, the association of Nck5a-(145-170) to C48 can be markedly reduced by high ionic strength whereas the interaction between Nck5a and Cdk5 is not affected. Third, substitution of Glu(157) by glutamine in Nck5a-(145-170) abolishes the peptide's ability to bind to the three Nck5a-binding proteins without diminishing its Cdk5 binding activity.
Cycloheximide facilitates the identification of aberrant transcripts resulting from a novel splice-site mutation in COL17A1 in a patient with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa.
Cyclooxygenase-2 activity is required for the development of lithium-induced polyuria. However, the involvement of a specific, terminal prostaglandin (PG) isomerase has not been evaluated. The present study was undertaken to assess lithium-induced polyuria in mice deficient in microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). A 2-wk administration of LiCl (4 mmol.kg(-1).day(-1) ip) in mPGES-1 +/+ mice led to a marked polyuria with hyposmotic urine. This was associated with elevated renal mPGES-1 protein expression and increased urine PGE(2) excretion. In contrast, mPGES-1 -/- mice were largely resistant to lithium-induced polyuria and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine PGE(2) and cAMP output. Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative (q) RT-PCR consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin-2 (AQP2) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of lithium-treated +/+ mice. This decrease was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice. qRT-PCR detected similar patterns of changes in AQP2 mRNA in the medulla but not in the cortex. Similarly, the total protein abundance of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the +/+ mice was significantly reduced by lithium treatment. In contrast, the dowregulation of renal medullary NKCC2 expression was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice. We conclude that mPGES-1-derived PGE(2) mediates lithium-induced polyuria likely via inhibition of AQP2 and NKCC2 expression.

Cyclosporin A (CsA; 50 mg/kg) and Fujimycine (FK506; 5 mg/kg), but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant rapamycin (5 mg/kg), caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate, degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium, and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days. The molecular mechanisms of CsA and FK506 toxicity were investigated. Cyclophilin A and FK506-binding protein, the main intracytoplasmic receptors for CsA and FK506, respectively, were each detected in renal tissue extract. In the kidney, high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants CsA and FK506, but not by rapamycin. Finally, specific immunophilin-drug-calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of CsA and FK506, but not rapamycin. These results suggest that the nephrotoxic effects of CsA and FK506 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase.
Cyclosporine and tacrolimus-associated thrombotic microangiopathy.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) was one of the first inherited disorders for which gene therapy was seriously considered as a realistic option for treatment, and as such, it has long provided a paradigm for gene therapy of inherited diseases. However, despite the cloning of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene in 1989, over 15 years later a practical gene therapy for CF has not eventuated. There are a number of reasons for this, and analysis of the specific issues that have delayed the successful development of gene therapy for CF also provides general insights into the practical complexities involved in the development of gene therapy for inherited disorders. The issues which have prevented the application of gene therapy for CF to date include the lack of suitable gene delivery technologies, the complexities of the interactions between the host and vector, the biology of the lung airways, and the nature of the pathology found in individuals with CF. We will discuss the history of CF gene therapy with specific reference to these and other issues that pre-occupy the field at present: namely, the question of what vectors appear to be suitable for airway gene delivery in CF, what cells must be targeted, how airway epithelium defences can be overcome or eluded to allow efficient gene delivery, how to ensure safe and long-term transgene expression and the need to identify relevant surrogate success measures that can be used to assess the outcome of gene therapy in CF patients.
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-related disorders encompass a disease spectrum from focal male reproductive tract involvement in congenital absence of the vas deferens to multiorgan involvement in classic cystic fibrosis. The reproductive, gastrointestinal, and exocrine manifestations of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator deficiency are correlated with CFTR genotype, whereas the respiratory manifestations that are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis are less predictable. Molecular genetic testing of CFTR has led to new diagnostic strategies and will enable targeting of molecular therapies now in development. Older diagnostic methods that measure sweat chloride and nasal potential difference nonetheless remain important because of their sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen and the genotyping of CFTR alleles are key to newborn screening programs because of low cost. The multiorgan nature of cystic fibrosis leads to a heavy burden of care, thus therapeutic regimens are tailored to the specific manifestations present in each patient. The variability of cystic fibrosis lung disease and the variable expressivity of mild CFTR alleles complicate genetic counseling for this autosomal recessive disorder. Widespread implementation of newborn screening programs among populations with significant cystic fibrosis mutation carrier frequencies is expected to result in increasing demands on genetic counseling resources.
Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of A2BP1/FOX1 as a candidate gene for autism.
Cytogenetic imbalances are increasingly being realized as causes of autism. Here, we report a de novo translocation between the short arms of chromosomes 15 and 16 in a female with autism, epilepsy, and global developmental delay. FISH analysis identified a cryptic deletion of approximately 160 kb at the boundary of the first exon and first intron of the 1.7 Mb ataxin-2 binding protein-1 (A2BP1) gene, also called FOX1. Quantitative real time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis verified a deletion of exon 1 in the 5' promoter region of the A2BP1 gene. Reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) showed reduced mRNA expression in the individual's lymphocytes, demonstrating the functional consequence of the deletion. A2BP1 codes for a brain-expressed RNA binding or splicing factor. Because of emerging evidence in the role of RNA processing and gene regulation in pervasive developmental disorders, we performed further screening of A2BP1 in additional individuals with autism from the Autism Genetics Resource Exchange (AGRE) collection. Twenty-seven SNPs were genotyped across A2BP1 in 206 parent-child trios and two regions showed association at P < or = 0.008 level. No additional deletions or clear mutations were identified in 88 probands by re-sequencing of all exons and surrounding intronic regions or quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) of exon 1. Although only nominal association was observed, and no obvious causal mutations were identified, these results suggest that A2BP1 may affect susceptibility or cause autism in a subset of patients. Further investigations in a larger sample may provide additional information regarding the involvement of this gene in the autistic phenotype.
Cytogenetic investigations in families with ataxia-telangiectasia.
Cytokines are important in the regulation of haematopoiesis and immune responses, and can influence lymphocyte development. Here we have identified a class I cytokine receptor that is selectively expressed in lymphoid tissues and is capable of signal transduction. The full-length receptor was expressed in BaF3 cells, which created a functional assay for ligand detection and cloning. Conditioned media from activated human CD3+ T cells supported proliferation of the assay cell line. We constructed a complementary DNA expression library from activated human CD3+ T cells, and identified a cytokine with a four-helix-bundle structure using functional cloning. This cytokine is most closely related to IL2 and IL15, and has been designated IL21 with the receptor designated IL21 R. In vitro assays suggest that IL21 has a role in the proliferation and maturation of natural killer (NK) cell populations from bone marrow, in the proliferation of mature B-cell populations co-stimulated with anti-CD40, and in the proliferation of T cells co-stimulated with anti-CD3.
Cytokines are molecules that control and modulate the activities of numerous target cells via binding to specific receptors. The observed differences in the cytokine production among individuals can be, at least partially, explained by gene polymorphisms. Several cytokine gene polymorphisms have been identified to play a role in susceptibility to various diseases, including autoimmune, infectious, allergic or cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the current study was to determine allele and genotype frequencies of 22 polymorphisms in 13 cytokine genes in the healthy Slovak population and to compare them with data available from six populations from Central and Southern Europe. A polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers was used to genotype polymorphisms within genes encoding IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1R, IL-1RA, IL-4Ralpha, IL-12, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 in a sample of 140 unrelated Slovak subjects. The allelic distribution of all polymorphisms in the Slovak population was very close to that in the geographically and historically closest populations in Central Europe--the Czech and the Polish. However, several differences were found between the Slovak and four populations from Southern Europe. The obtained data represent a basis for further studies on association of cytokine gene polymorphisms with some diseases.
Cytokines in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family regulate development and function of the immune system. We have isolated a new member of this family, designated Apo-2 ligand (Apo-2L), via an expressed sequence tag. Apo-2L is a 281-amino acid protein, related most closely to Fas/Apo-1 ligand. Transfected Apo-2L is expressed at the cell surface with its C terminus exposed, indicating a type II transmembrane protein topology. Like Fas/Apo-1 ligand and TNF, the C-terminal extracellular region of Apo-2L (amino acids 114-281) exhibits a homotrimeric subunit structure. Soluble Apo-2L induces extensive apoptosis in lymphoid as well as non-lymphoid tumor cell lines. The effect of Apo-2L is not inhibited by soluble Fas/Apo-1 and TNF receptors; moreover, expression of human Fas/Apo-1 in mouse fibroblasts, which confers sensitivity to induction of apoptosis by agonistic anti-Fas/Apo-1 antibody, does not confer sensitivity to Apo-2L. Hence, Apo-2L acts via a receptor which is distinct from Fas/Apo-1 and TNF receptors. These results suggest that, along with other family members such as Fas/Apo-1 ligand and TNF, Apo-2L may serve as an extracellular signal that triggers programmed cell death.
Cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects of temsirolimus in refractory mantle cell lymphoma.
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4, also known as CD152) has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of T cell activation. Its membrane expression is highly regulated by endocytosis and trafficking through the secretory lysosome pathway. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene, LYST. It results in defective membrane targeting of the proteins present in secretory lysosomes, and it is associated with a variety of features, including a lymphoproliferative syndrome with hemophagocytosis. The murine equivalent of CHS, beige mice, present similar characteristics but do not develop the lymphoproliferative syndrome. We show herein that CTLA-4 is present in enlarged, abnormal vesicles in CHS T cells and is not properly expressed at the cell surface after T cell activation, whereas its surface expression is not impaired. It is therefore proposed that the defective surface expression of CTLA-4 by CHS T cells is involved in the generation of lymphoproliferative disease. This observation may provide insight into the role of CTLA-4 in humans..
Cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor (CLMF) is a disulfide-bonded heterodimeric lymphokine that (i) acts as a growth factor for activated T cells independent of interleukin 2 and (ii) synergizes with suboptimal concentrations of interleukin 2 to induce lymphokine-activated killer cells. We now report the cloning and expression of both human CLMF subunit cDNAs from a lymphoblastoid B-cell line, NC-37. The two subunits represent two distinct and unrelated gene products whose mRNAs are coordinately induced upon activation of NC-37 cells. Coexpression of the two subunit cDNAs in COS cells is necessary for the secretion of biologically active CLMF; COS cells transfected with either subunit cDNA alone do not secrete bioactive CLMF. Recombinant CLMF expressed in mammalian cells displays biologic activities essentially identical to natural CLMF, and its activities can be neutralized by monoclonal antibodies prepared against natural CLMF. Since this heterodimeric protein displays the properties of an interleukin, we propose that CLMF be given the designation interleukin 12.
Cytotoxicity of Fas ligand against lymphoma cells with radiation-induced Fas antigen.
D-Dopachrome tautomerase converts 2-carboxy-2,3-dihydroindole-5,6-quinone (D-dopachrome) into 5,6-dihydroxyindole. This protein has an amino acid sequence that is highly homologous with that of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which has the potential to catalyze D-dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid and is an important cytokine for T-lymphocyte activation. We isolated and sequenced a 566 bp-long cDNA encoding human D-dopachrome tautomerase. The cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding 118 amino acids, including the initiator methionine. The amino acid sequence of the protein shares 80% homology with that of the rat enzyme. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that mRNA of D-dopachrome tautomerase is expressed in a large amount in the liver, and to lesser extent in other organs, including the heart, lung and pancreas. After purification of D-dopachrome tautomerase expressed in E. coli, we confirmed that the recombinant protein catalyzes the conversion of D-dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole. Its catalytic mechanism is not well understood. We found that the protein completely lost the enzyme activity when the N-terminal proline residue was replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. This fact suggests that the N-terminal proline is essential for the catalytic mechanism. Although the precise pathophysiological function of D-dopachrome tautomerase remains to be elucidated, the present results could contribute to further understanding of isomerase activity in relation to the immune response.

DEAD-box proteins are a large group of putative RNA helicases that exist ubiquitously in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. They are likely to play important roles in many different RNA metabolic processes. In this paper, we report the cloning of human DDX24, a putative DEAD-box protein, and its ortholog, Ddx24 in mouse. The deduced proteins encoded by these two cDNAs share 78.7% identity at the amino acid level and possess all the well-conserved motifs of DEAD-box proteins. However, little homology can be found between them and other DEAD-box proteins, even in their core region (identity <40%). Northern blot analysis showed that a 3.0-kb transcript of human DDX24 exists ubiquitously in the 16 human tissues examined and was most abundant in heart and brain, but with lowest levels in thymus and small intestine. The mouse Ddx24, whose transcript is 4.0 kb, was also expressed widely in 10 tissues tested with the highest level in heart and testis. By radiation hybrid mapping, the human DDX24 gene was localized to human chromosome 14q32 between the markers D14S81 and D14S265. Moreover, the gene structure of DDX24 was determined by comparing its cDNA and genomic sequence from BAC R-1089B7, which showed that the gene spanned a 30-kb region and consisted of at least nine exons.

DNA fragmentation in human fibroblasts under extremely low frequency electromagnetic field exposure.
DNA ligase IV in a complex with XRCC4 is responsible for DNA end-joining in repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and V(D)J recombination. We found that non-histone chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) proteins 1 and 2 enhanced the ligation of linearized pUC119 DNA with DNA ligase IV from rat liver nuclear extract. Intra-molecular and inter-molecular ligations of cohesive-ended and blunt-ended DNA were markedly stimulated by HMG1 and 2. Recombinant HMG2-domain A, B, and (A + B) polypeptides were similarly, but non-identically, effective for the stimulation of DSB ligation reaction. Ligation of single-strand breaks (nicks) was only slightly activated by the HMG proteins. The DNA end-binding Ku protein singly or in combination with the catalytic component of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as the DNA-PK holoenzyme was ineffective for the ligation of linearized pUC119 DNA. Although the stimulatory effect of HMG1 and 2 on ligation of DSB in vitro was not specific to DNA ligase IV, these results suggest that HMG1 and 2 are involved in the final ligation step in DNA end-joining processes of DSB repair and V(D)J recombination.
DNA methylation can contribute to transcriptional silencing through several transcriptionally repressive complexes, which include methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). We show here that the chief enzyme that maintains mammalian DNA methylation, DNMT1, can also establish a repressive transcription complex. The non-catalytic amino terminus of DNMT1 binds to HDAC2 and a new protein, DMAP1 (for DNMT1 associated protein), and can mediate transcriptional repression. DMAP1 has intrinsic transcription repressive activity, and binds to the transcriptional co-repressor TSG101. DMAP1 is targeted to replication foci through interaction with the far N terminus of DNMT1 throughout S phase, whereas HDAC2 joins DNMT1 and DMAP1 only during late S phase, providing a platform for how histones may become deacetylated in heterochromatin following replication. Thus, DNMT1 not only maintains DNA methylation, but also may directly target, in a heritable manner, transcriptionally repressive chromatin to the genome during DNA replication.
DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta) is important for the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Overexpression of Pol beta is frequently found in cancer cells and is thought to be associated with tumorigenesis. In this study, we examined BER fidelity in extracts derived from a human lymphoblastoid cell line that over expresses Pol beta compared to normal control cells. Using an in vitro mutagenesis assay, we found an increased rate of frameshift mutations arising during DNA repair in whole-cell extracts derived from the Pol beta-overexpressing cells. We demonstrate that the addition of excess Pol beta to a control cell extract enhances the mutagenic potential of the extract. Furthermore, using cell extracts and purified Pol beta, we demonstrate that the mechanism of frameshift formation involves slippage of Pol beta during the one-nucleotide gap-filling step of BER and that this slippage is fixed by strand-displacement synthesis stimulated by an excess of Pol beta.
DNA repair synthesis following UV irradiation of confluent human fibroblasts has a biphasic time course with an early phase of rapid nucleotide incorporation and a late phase of much slower nucleotide incorporation. The biphasic nature of this curve suggests that two distinct DNA repair systems may be operative. Previous studies have specifically implicated DNA polymerase delta as the enzyme involved in DNA repair synthesis occurring immediately after UV damage. In this paper, we describe studies of DNA polymerase involvement in DNA repair synthesis in confluent human fibroblasts at late times after UV irradiation. Late UV-induced DNA repair synthesis in both intact and permeable cells was found to be inhibited by aphidicolin, indicating the involvement of one of the aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerases, alpha or delta. In permeable cells, the process was further analyzed by using the nucleotide analogue (butylphenyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate, which inhibits DNA polymerase alpha several hundred times more strongly than it inhibits DNA polymerase delta. The (butylphenyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate inhibition curve for late UV-induced repair synthesis was very similar to that for polymerase delta. It appears that repair synthesis at late times after UV irradiation, like repair synthesis at early times, is mediated by DNA polymerase delta.

Data from 60 patients treated with amikacin were analyzed for factors associated with nephrotoxicity. In 42 of these patients, data were examined for factors associated with clinical outcome. Variables evaluated included patient weight, age, sex, serum creatinine level, creatinine clearance, duration of therapy, total dose, mean daily dose, organism minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), mean peak levels, mean trough levels, mean area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC), total AUC, mean AUC greater than MIC, total AUC greater than MIC, mean Schumacher's intensity factor (IF), total IF, In (mean maximum concentration [Cmax]/MIC). Model-dependent pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by computer based on a one-compartment model. When the parameters were examined individually, duration of therapy and total AUC correlated significantly (P less than .05) with nephrotoxicity. In contrast, a stepwise discriminant function analysis identified only duration of therapy (P less than .001) as an important factor. Based on this model and on Bayes' theorem, the predictive accuracy of identifying "nephrotoxic" patients increased from 0.17 to 0.39. When examined individually, mean IF, MIC, total dose, mean daily dose, and ln (mean Cmax/MIC) correlated significantly (P less than .05) with cure. In contrast, a simultaneous multivariable analysis identified IF, MIC, and total dose according to one model and ln (mean Cmax/MIC) according to a second statistical model of parameters selected to have the greatest prospective value. Based on Bayes' theorem and the first model, the predictive accuracy of identifying patients not cured increased from 0.19 to 0.83. For the second model, the predictive accuracy increased from 0.19 to 0.50.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Daxx and histone deacetylase II associate with chromatin through an interaction with core histones and the chromatin-associated protein Dek.
Daxx has been reported to mediate the Fas/JNK-dependent signals in the cytoplasm. However, several evidences have suggested that Daxx is located mainly in the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional regulator. Recently, we identified DMAP1, a TSG101-interacting protein as a Daxx binding partner by yeast two-hybrid screening. TSG101 has been shown to act as transcriptional co-repressor of nuclear hormone receptors. Here we examined whether TSG101also interacts with Daxx directly. The association of Daxx and TSG101 was confirmed using co-expressed tagged proteins. The interaction regions in both proteins were also mapped, and the cellular localization of the interaction was examined. TSG101 formed a complex with Daxx through its coiled-coil domain and co-localized in the nucleus. Furthermore, TSG101 enhanced Daxx-mediated repression of glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activity. These results provide the novel molecular interactions between Daxx and TSG101, which establish an efficient repressive transcription complex in the nucleus.

Defects in iron absorption and utilization lead to iron deficiency and overload disorders. Adult mammals absorb iron through the duodenum, whereas embryos obtain iron through placental transport. Iron uptake from the intestinal lumen through the apical surface of polarized duodenal enterocytes is mediated by the divalent metal transporter, DMTi. A second transporter has been postulated to export iron across the basolateral surface to the circulation. Here we have used positional cloning to identify the gene responsible for the hypochromic anaemia of the zebrafish mutant weissherbst. The gene, ferroportin1, encodes a multiple-transmembrane domain protein, expressed in the yolk sac, that is a candidate for the elusive iron exporter. Zebrafish ferroportin1 is required for the transport of iron from maternally derived yolk stores to the circulation and functions as an iron exporter when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Human Ferroportin1 is found at the basal surface of placental syncytiotrophoblasts, suggesting that it also transports iron from mother to embryo. Mammalian Ferroportin1 is expressed at the basolateral surface of duodenal enterocytes and could export cellular iron into the circulation. We propose that Ferroportin1 function may be perturbed in mammalian disorders of iron deficiency or overload.
Defects in superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production may be implicated in the high incidence of bacterial infections in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). In the present study, oxygen radical production in patients with ALF due to paracetamol overdose was compared with that of healthy volunteers. Neutrophils from 14 ALF patients were stimulated via the complement receptors using zymosan opsonized with ALF or control serum. Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by ALF neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with ALF serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects (P < 0.01). This defect persisted when zymosan opsonized by control serum was used (P < 0.05). Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in neutrophils stimulated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) from a further 18 ALF patients was unaffected compared with control neutrophils. Serum C3 complement levels were significantly reduced in ALF patients compared with control subjects (P < 0.0005). These results demonstrate a neutrophil defect in ALF due to paracetamol overdose, that is complement dependent but independent of serum complement, possibly connected to the complement receptor.
Deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA) enzyme activity causes metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). A number of ARSA gene mutations responsible for MLD have been identified. Recently, the R496H mutation of ARSA was proposed to be a cause of MLD (Draghia et al., 1997). We have investigated the R496H mutation and found this mutation at a relatively high frequency in an African American population (f = 0. 09, n = 61 subjects). The ARSA enzyme activity in subjects with and without the R496H mutation was determined and found to be normal. It is therefore concluded that the R496H mutation of ARSA does not negatively influence the activity of ARSA and is not a cause of MLD
Deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) activity typically results in Tay-Sachs disease. However, healthy subjects found to be deficient in Hex A activity (i. e., pseudodeficient) by means of in vitro biochemical tests have been described. We analyzed the HEXA gene of one pseudodeficient subject and identified both a C739-to-T substitution that changes Arg247----Trp on one allele and a previously identified Tay-Sachs disease mutation on the second allele. Six additional pseudodeficient subjects were found to have the C739-to-T mutation. This allele accounted for 32% (20/62) of non-Jewish enzyme-defined Tay-Sachs disease carriers but for none of 36 Jewish enzyme-defined carriers who did not have one of three known mutations common to this group. The C739-to-T allele, together with a " true " Tay-Sachs disease allele, causes Hex A pseudodeficiency. Given both the large proportion of non-Jewish carriers with this allele and that standard biochemical screening cannot differentiate between heterozygotes for the C739-to-T mutations and Tay-Sachs disease carriers, DNA testing for this mutation in at-risk couples is essential.
Deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is usually found at high frequencies in areas of the world where malaria has been endemic. The frequency and genetic basis of G6PD deficiency have been studied in Africa, around the Mediterranean, and in the Far East, but little such information is available about the situation in India. To determine the extent of heterogeneity of G6PD, we have studied several different Indian populations by screening for G6PD deficiency, followed by molecular analysis of deficient alleles. The frequency of G6PD deficiency varies between 3% and 15% in different tribal and urban groups. Remarkably, a previously unreported deficient variant, G6PD Orissa (44 Ala-- > Gly), is responsible for most of the G6PD deficiency in tribal Indian populations but is not found in urban populations, where most of the G6PD deficiency is due to the G6PD Mediterranean (188 Ser-- > Phe) variant. The KmNADP of G6PD Orissa is fivefold higher than that of the normal enzyme. This may be due to the fact that the alanine residue that is replaced by glycine is part of a putative coenzyme-binding site..

Deficiency of the muscle isozyme of glycogen phosphorylase is causative of McArdle disease or Glycogen storage disease type V (GSD-V), the most common autosomal recessive disorder of glycogen metabolism. The typical clinical presentation is characterized by exercise intolerance with cramps, and recurrent myoglobinuria. To date, 46 mutations in the PYGM gene have been detected in GSD-V patients. We report the mutational spectrum in 68 Italian patients. We identified 30 different mutations in the PYGM gene, including 19 mutations that have not been reported previously. The novel mutations include: eight missense mutations (c.475G>A, p.G159R; c.689C>G, p.P230R; c.1094C>T, p.A365E; c.1151C>A, p.A384D; c.1182C>T, p.R428C; c.1471C>T, p.R491C; c.2444A>C, p.D815A; c.2477G>C, p.W826S), two nonsense mutations (c.1475G>A, p.W492X; c.1627A>T, p.K543X), five splice site mutations (c.855 +1G>C; c.1092 +1G>A; c. 1093-1G>T; c.1239 +1G>A; c.2380 +1G>A), and four deletions (c.715_717delGTC, p.V239del; c.304delA, p.N102DfsX4; c.1970_2177del, p.V657_G726; c.2113_2114delGG, p.G705RfsX16). Whereas we confirmed lack of direct correlation between the clinical phenotype and the genotype, we also found that the so-called 'common mutation' (p.R50X) accounted for about 43% of alleles in our cohort and that no population-related mutations are clearly identified in Italian patients.
Deficiency of the ninth component of human complement (C9) is the most common complement deficiency in Japan but is rare in other countries. We studied the molecular basis of C9 deficiency in four Japanese C9-deficient patients who had suffered from meningococcal meningitis. Direct sequencing of amplified C9 cDNA and DNA revealed a nonsense substitution (CGA-- > TGA) at codon 95 in exon 4 in the four C9-deficient individuals. An allele-specific polymerase chain reaction system designed to detect exclusively only one of the normal and mutant alleles indicated that all the four patients were homozygous for the mutation in exon 4 and that the parents of patient 2 were heterozygous. The common mutation at codon 95 in exon 4 might be responsible for most Japanese C9 deficiency..
Deficiency of the ninth component of human complement (C9) is the most common complement deficiency in Japan, with an incidence of approximately one homozygote in 1000, but is very rare in other countries. Genetic analyses of Japanese C9 deficiency have shown that a C-to-T transition leading to TGA stop codon for Arg95 in exon 4 of the C9 gene (Arg95Stop) is common in Japanese C9 deficiency. To determine the prevalence of heterozygous carriers of the Arg95Stop mutation in a Japanese population, we collected DNA samples from 300 individuals in two of the four main islands of Japan. Heterozygote detection was performed with an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system designed to detect exclusively only one of the normal and mutant alleles, followed by confirmation with PCR/single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing. Twenty individuals were heterozygous for the Arg95Stop mutation. None was homozygous. The prevalence of carriers of the Arg95Stop mutation was 6. 7% (20/300). An estimated frequency (0. 12%) of complete C9 deficiency due to homozygous Arg95Stop mutation was consistent with frequencies determined by serological studies
Deficiency of the sixth component of human complement (C6) has been reported in a number of families from the western Cape, South Africa. Meningococcal disease is endemic in the Cape and almost all pedigrees of total C6 deficiency (C6Q0) have been ascertained because of recurrent disease. We have sequenced the expressed exons of the C6 gene from selected cases and have found three molecular defects leading to total deficiency 879delG, which is the common defect in the Cape and hitherto unreported, and 1195delC and 1936delG, which have been previously reported in African-Americans. We also show that the 879delG and 1195delC defects are associated with characteristic C6/C7 region DNA marker haplotypes, although small variations were observed. The 1936delG defect was observed only once in the Cape, but its associated haplotype could be deduced. The data from the haplotypes indicate that these three molecular defects account for the defects in all the 38 unrelated C6Q0 individuals we have studied from the Cape. We have also observed the 879delG defect in two Dutch C6-deficient kindreds, but the 879delG defect in the Cape probably did not come from The Netherlands..
Deficit of in vivo mitochondrial ATP production in patients with Friedreich ataxia.
Definition and management of anemia in patients infected with hepatitis C virus.
Dehydrated rats regularly develop acute renal failure following single injection of aminoglycoside antibiotics combined with dextran or of antibiotics only. Oral administration of 2,5-di-O-acetyl-D-glucaro-1,4-6,3-dilactone protected rats against renal failure induced by kanamycin-dextran. The protective effect was prevalent among D-glucarates, and also to other saccharic acid, hexauronic acids and hexaaldonic acids, although to a lesser degree, but not to a hexaaldose, sugar alcohols, substances inthe TCA cycle and other acidic compounds. D-Glucarates were effective against renal damage induced by peptide antibiotics as well as various aminoglycoside antibitocis. Dose-responses were observed in the protective effect of D-Glucarates. With a D-glucarate of a fixed size of dose, approximately the same degree of protection was obtained against renal damages induced by different basic antibiotics despite large disparities in administration doses of different antibiotics. D-Glucarates had the ability to prevent renal damage but not to cure it. Rats excreted acidic urine when they were spared from renal lesions by monosaccharides. The reduction effect of D-glucarates against nephrotoxicity of basic antibiotics was discussed.

Deletion of chromosomal 3p12.3 was suggested to be associated with dysplastic lesions of head and neck. This region harbors two candidate tumor suppressors ROBO1/DUTT1, ROBO2 and two non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) located at intron 2 of ROBO1/DUTT1. Aim of this study is to understand the role of these genes in development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. A collection of 72 dysplastic lesions and 116 HNSCC samples and two oral cancer cell lines were analyzed for ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 deletion and promoter methylation. ROBO1/DUTT1, ROBO2 and two ncRNAs mRNA expression were analyzed by Q-PCR. Immunohistochemical analysis of ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 was performed. Alterations of these genes were correlated with different clinicopathological parameters. High frequency of molecular alterations (deletion/methylation) was seen in ROBO1/DUTT1 than ROBO2. In mild dysplastic lesions both of these genes showed high molecular alterations and remained more or less constant in subsequent stages. Q-PCR analysis showed reduced expression of these genes and the two ncRNAs. In vitro demethylation experiment by 5-aza-dC showed upregulation of ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 while the expression of the ncRNAs remained unchanged. Immunohistochemical analysis of ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 showed concordance with their mRNA expression and molecular alterations. Poor patients' outcome was predicted in the cases with alteration of ROBO1/DUTT1 along with tobacco addiction and nodal involvement. Our data suggests (a) ROBO1/DUTT1 and the ncRNAs are transcribed from different promoters, and (b) inactivation of ROBO1/DUTT1 could be used as molecular signature for early detection and prognosis of the head and neck cancer.

Deletion of the KIT and PDGFRA genes in a patient with piebaldism.
Deletions and other abnormalities of human chromosome 15q11-q13 are associated with two developmental disorders, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS). Loss of expression of imprinted, paternally expressed genes has been implicated in PWS. However, the number of imprinted genes that contribute to PWS, and the range over which the imprinting signal acts to silence one copy of the gene in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, are unknown. To identify additional imprinted genes that could contribute to the PWS phenotype and to understand the regional control of imprinting in 15q11-q13, we have constructed an imprinted transcript map of the PWS-AS deletion interval. The imprinting status of 22 expressed sequence tags derived from the radiation-hybrid human transcript maps or physical maps was determined in a reverse transcriptase-PCR assay and correlated with the position of the transcripts on the physical map. Seven new paternally expressed transcripts localize to an approximately 1. 5-Mb domain surrounding the SNRPN-associated imprinting center, which already includes four imprinted, paternally expressed genes. All other tested new transcripts in the deletion region were expressed from both alleles. A domain of exclusive paternal expression surrounding the imprinting center suggests strong regional control of the imprinting process. This study provides the means for further investigation of additional genes that cause or modify the phenotypes associated with rearrangements of 15q11-q13.
Deletions of a DNA sequence in retinoblastomas and mesenchymal tumors: organization of the sequence and its encoded protein.
Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 are relatively uncommon and to date minimal genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed. We report on three unrelated patients with de novo paternal interstitial deletions of 6q24.3. FISH mapping was used to delineate the minimal region of overlap between these three patients. Although all three patients had different size deletions and different breakpoints, two of the patients shared a 2.5 Mb region of overlap and strikingly similar facial features including a triangular face, frontal bossing with metopic prominence, short and upward-slanting palpebral fissures, asymmetry of upper eyelids, hooded eyelids, shallow orbits, prominent inferior orbital crease, wide mouth, and long and flat philtrum. They also had redundant skin, joint laxity, a small thorax, and early developmental delay. The smallest region of overlap between all three patients was a region of deletion less than 1 Mb; all had a history of IUGR and postnatal short stature without overt radiologic skeletal anomalies. The dysmorphic features, early developmental and growth delay may be due to the hemizygous state for one of the genes in the deleted region of two of the patients or to a long range effect of the deletion on expression of other genes. In addition, since imprinted genes have been reported in this region, paternal deletion of an imprinted gene in all three patients may contribute to the growth phenotype. We propose that this is a new congenital malformation syndrome associated with a paternal deletion of 6q24.3.

Denys-Drash syndrome is a rare human condition in which severe urogenital aberrations result in renal failure, pseudohermaphroditism, and Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma). To investigate its possible role, we have analyzed the coding exons of the Wilms tumor suppressor gene (WT1) for germline mutations. In ten independent cases of Denys-Drash syndrome, point mutations in the zinc finger domains of one WT1 gene copy were found. Nine of these mutations are found within exon 9 (zinc finger III); the remaining mutation is in exon 8 (zinc finger II). These mutations directly affect DNA sequence recognition. In two families analyzed, the mutations were shown to arise de novo. Wilms tumors from three individuals and one juvenile granulosa cell tumor demonstrate reduction to homozygosity for the mutated WT1 allele. Our results provide evidence of a direct role for WT1 in Denys-Drash syndrome and thus urogenital system development..
Denys-Drash syndrome is a rare human developmental disorder affecting the urogenital system and leading to renal failure, intersex disorders and Wilms tumour. In this report, four individuals with this syndrome are described carrying germline point mutations in the Wilms tumour suppressor gene, WT1. Three of these mutations were in the zinc finger domains of WT1. The fourth occurred within intron 9, preventing splicing at one of the alternatively chosen splice donor sites of exon 9 when assayed in vitro. These results provide genetic evidence for distinct functional roles of the WT1 isoforms in urogenital development..
Deoxycholic acid conjugation, transport capacity, and metabolism were compared in control and ethinyl estradiol-treated rats. Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport deoxycholic acid than taurodeoxycholic acid, and both were decreased by ethinyl estradiol treatment. During [24-14C]sodium deoxycholate infusion, [14C]biliary bile acid secretion increased, but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or ethinyl estradiol-treated rats. Ethinyl estradiol-treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as taurocholic acid than did control animals, consistent with an impairment of 7alpha-hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid. Ethinyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid, but did result in an increase in sulfation of taurodeoxycholic acid from 1.5% in controls to nearly 4.0% (P less than 0.01). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for deoxycholic acid than do certain other species. Furthermore, the rat converts deoxycholic acid, a poor choleretic, to taurocholic acid, a good choleretic. When this conversion is impaired with ethinyl estradiol treatment, sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful bile acid.
Depletion of mitochondrial DNA in fibroblast cultures from patients with POLG1 mutations is a consequence of catalytic mutations.
Depression and sexual dysfunction have been related to side effects of topical beta-blockers. We performed a preliminary study in order to determine any difference between a non selective beta-blocker (timolol) and a selective beta-blocker (betaxolol) regarding CNS side effects. Eight glaucomatous patients chronically treated with timolol 0.5%/12h, suffering from depression diagnosed through DMS-III-R criteria, were included in the study. During the six-month follow up, depression was quantified through the Beck and Zung-Conde scales every two months. In a double blind cross-over study with control group, the patients under timolol treatment presented higher depression values measured through the Beck and the Zung-Conde scales (p < 0.001 vs control). These results suggest that betaxolol could be less of a depression-inducer than timolol in predisposed patients.
Depression is a major clinical feature of Parkinson's disease. We report the increased amount of motor disability in four patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease after exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine. The possibility of a clinically relevant dopamine-antagonistic capacity of fluoxetine in Parkinson's disease patients must be considered.

Dermal developmental toxicity of N-phenylimide herbicides in rats.
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) displays chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 and 22, which fuse the collagen type Ialpha1 (COLIA1) gene to the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain (PDGFB) gene. To characterize the functional and structural properties of the COLIA1/PDGFB fusion protein, we generated a stable NIH3T3 cell line that contained a tumor-derived chimeric gene resulting from a COIA1 intron 7-PDGFB intron 1 fusion. Expression of the fusion protein led to morphological transformation and increased growth rate of these cells. The PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor CGP57148B reversed the transformed phenotype and reduced the growth rate of COLIA1/PDGFB-expressing cells but had no effects on control cells. The presence of dimeric COLIA1/PDGFB precursors was demonstrated through PDGFB immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled cells and also by PDGFB immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting with COLIA1 antibodies. Pulse-chase studies demonstrated that the COLIA1/PDGFB precursor was processed to an end product that was indistinguishable from wild-type PDGF-BB. Finally, COLIA1/PDGFB-expressing cells generated tumors after s. c c. injection into nude mice, and tumor growth was reduced by treatment with CGP57148B. We conclude that the COLIA1/PDGFB fusion associated with DFSP contributes to tumor development through ectopic production of PDGF-BB and the formation of an autocrine loop. Our findings, thus, suggest that PDGF receptors could be a target for pharmacological treatment of DFSP and giant cell fibroblastoma, e. g., through the use of PDGF receptor kinase inhibitors such as CGP57148B.

Desipramine-induced delirium at "subtherapeutic" concentrations: a case report.
Desmosomes are adhesive cell junctions found in great abundance in tissues that experience mechanical stress. The transmembrane desmosomal glycoproteins have been proposed to play a role in cell adhesion; desmoglein I (DGI) is a major member of this class of desmosomal molecules. However, evidence supporting a role for DGI in cell adhesion or in the plaque is lacking. In order to begin to understand DGI function we have identified human cDNA clones encoding the entire mature polypeptide of 1000 amino acids. Our data suggest that like the bovine DGI molecule human DGI is highly related to the calcium-dependent class of cell adhesion molecules known as cadherins. Four related extracellular domains located in the amino-terminal domain of the molecule contain putative calcium binding sites originally identified in the cadherins. The highest degree of similarity between human N-cadherin and human DGI, and likewise between bovine DGI and human DGI, is greatest in the most amino-terminal extracellular domain. This suggests a conserved functional role for the extracellular domains, perhaps in calcium-mediated cell adhesion. The cytoplasmic portion of the molecule contains a cadherin-like region and, like bovine DGI, a carboxy-terminal tail that is not present in the cadherins, comprising three additional domains. One of these contains a novel repeating motif of 29 +/- 1 residues, first identified in bovine DGI. Each of the highly homologous repeating units is likely to consist of two beta-strands and two turns with special characteristics. Five amino acids that are identical in bovine and human DGI lie in the second of the two predicted beta-strands, and intriguingly contain putative target sites for protein kinase C. On the basis of structural analysis, a model predicting the disposition of human DGI domains in the desmosome is proposed. Northern analysis suggests that unlike bovine epidermis, which expresses a single mRNA of reported size approximately 7.6 kb, human foreskin and cultured keratinocytes display a complex pattern with bands of approximately 7.2, 4.0 and 3.0 kb. Each of these cross-hybridizing mRNAs is coordinately expressed in normal human keratinocytes in response to long-term culture and increased calcium.
Despite extensive clinical experience the role of digoxin is still not well defined. In patients with atrial fibrillation digoxin is beneficial for ventricular rate control. For patients in sinus rhythm and heart failure the situation is less clear. Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic:toxic ratio and concentrations are affected by a number of drugs. Also, digoxin has undesirable effects such as increasing peripheral resistance and myocardial demands, and causing arrhythmias. There is a paucity of data from well-designed trials. The trials that are available are generally small with limitations in design and these show variation in patient benefit. More convincing evidence is required showing that digoxin improves symptoms or exercise capacity. Furthermore, no trial has had sufficient power to evaluate mortality. Pooled analysis of the effects of other inotropic drugs shows an excess mortality and there is a possibility that digoxin may increase mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used first as they are safer, do not require blood level monitoring, modify progression of disease, relieve symptoms, improve exercise tolerance and reduce mortality. Caution should be exercised in using digoxin until large mortality trials are completed showing either benefit or harm. Until then digoxin should be considered a third-line therapy.
Despite increasing reports on nonionic contrast media-induced nephropathy (CIN) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures, the studies in pediatrics are limited, with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography. This prospective study determined the incidence of CIN for two nonionic contrast media (CM), iopromide and iohexol, among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of CM and the presence of cyanosis. The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either iopromide (group A, n = 40) or iohexol (group B, n = 40). Serum sodium (Na), potassium (K), and creatinine (Cr) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values, then measured again at 12-, 24-, and 48-h intervals after CM use. Urine samples for Na and Cr also were checked at the same intervals. Risk of renal failure, Injury to the kidney, Failure of kidney function, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage renal damage (RIFLE criteria) were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study population. Accordingly, among the 15 CIN patients (18.75%), 7.5% of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3.75% had renal injury, whereas 5% of group B had increased risk and 2.5% had renal injury. Whereas 33.3% of the patients with CIN were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of CIN related to the different dosages of CM (p = 0.014). Among the 15 patients with CIN, 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases, but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients (p = 0.243). Although clinically silent, CIN is not rare in pediatrics. The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic CM, nor on the presence of cyanosis, and although CIN usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.
Despite its importance for the regulation of heart function, little is known about the isoform expression of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) in human myocardium. In this study, we investigated the spectrum of CaMKII isoforms delta2, delta3, delta4, delta8, and delta9 in human striated muscle tissue. Isoform delta3 is characteristically expressed in cardiac muscle. In skeletal muscle, specific expression of a new isoform termed delta11 is demonstrated. Complete sequencing of human delta2 cDNA, representing all common features of the investigated CaMKII subclass, revealed its high homology to the corresponding rat cDNA. Comparative semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses from left ventricular tissues of normal hearts and from patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy showed a significant increase in transcript levels of isoform delta3 relative to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in diseased hearts (101. 6+/-11.0% versus 64.9+/-9.9% in the nonfailing group; P < 0.05, n=6). Transcript levels of the other investigated cardiac CaMKII isoforms remained unchanged. At the protein level, by using a subclass-specific antibody, we observed a similar increase of a delta-CaMKII-specific signal (7.2+/-1.0 versus 3.8+/-0.7 optical density units in the nonfailing group; P < 0.05, n=4 through 6). The diseased state of the failing hearts was confirmed by a significant increase in transcript levels for atrial natriuretic peptide (292. 9+/-76.4% versus 40.1+/-3.2% in the nonfailing group; P < 0.05, n=3 through 6). Our data characterize for the first time the delta-CaMKII isoform expression pattern in human hearts and demonstrate changes in this expression pattern in heart failure.
Despite popular use of piperacillin, the dire neurotoxicity associated with piperacillin still goes unrecognized, leading to a delay in appropriate management. We report a 57-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), who developed slurred speech, tremor, bizarre behavior, progressive mental confusion, and 2 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) after 5 doses of piperacillin/tazobactam (2 g/250 mg) were given for bronchiectasis with secondary infection. The laboratory data revealed normal plasma electrolyte and ammonia levels but leukocytosis. Neurologic examinations showed dysarthria and bilateral Babinski sign. Computed tomography of brain and electroencephalogram were unremarkable. Despite the use of antiepileptic agents, another GTCS episode recurred after the sixth dose of piperacillin/tazobactam. Brain magnetic resonance imaging did not demonstrate acute infarction and organic brain lesions. Initiation of high-flux hemodialysis rapidly reversed the neurologic symptoms within 4 hours. Piperacillin-induced encephalopathy should be considered in any uremic patients with unexplained neurological manifestations. CAPD is inefficient in removing piperacillin, whereas hemodialysis can rapidly terminate the piperacillin-induced encephalopathy.
Despite the increasing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level, relatively few methods have been available. In this study, we developed a new hypoxia-responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia-responsive element of the 5' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia-sensing transgenic rat. We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney. With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model. Expression of the hypoxia-responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2.2-fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2.6-fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model, whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease, reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes. The degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial injury in both models. Finally, we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive, ED-1-positive, and terminal dUTP nick-end labeled-positive cells in the hypoxic cortical area in the remnant kidney model. We propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia and progressive glomerular diseases.

Dexamethasone is frequently administered to the developing fetus to accelerate pulmonary development. The purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal dexamethasone programmed a progressive increase in blood pressure and renal injury in rats. Pregnant rats were given either vehicle or 2 daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg body weight) on gestational days 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 15 and 16, 17 and 18, or 19 and 20. Offspring of rats administered dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20% reduction in glomerular number compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age (22 527+/-509 versus 28 050+/-561, P<0.05), which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of age. Six- to 9-month old rats receiving prenatal dexamethasone on days 17 and 18 of gestation had a 17% reduction in glomeruli (23 380+/-587) compared with control rats (P<0.05). Male rats that received prenatal dexamethasone on days 15 and 16, 17 and 18, and 13 and 14 of gestation had elevated blood pressures at 6 months of age; the latter group did not have a reduction in glomerular number. Adult rats given dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with glomerulosclerosis than control rats. This study shows that prenatal dexamethasone in rats results in a reduction in glomerular number, glomerulosclerosis, and hypertension when administered at specific points during gestation. Hypertension was observed in animals that had a reduction in glomeruli as well as in a group that did not have a reduction in glomerular number, suggesting that a reduction in glomerular number is not the sole cause for the development of hypertension.
Dexamethasone- (Dex-) induced hypertension is associated with enhanced oxidative stress. Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding glycoprotein with antihypertensive properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic administration of LF on oxidative stress and hypertension upon Dex administration. Male Wistar rats were treated by Dex (30 u g/kg/day subcutaneously) or saline for 14 days. Oral bovine LF (30, 100, 300 mg/kg) was given from day 8 to 14 in a reversal study. In a prevention study, rats received 4 days of LF treatment followed by Dex and continued during the test period. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured using tail-cuff method. Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity. Plasma hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value were determined. Dexamethasone significantly increased SBP and plasma H2O2 level and decreased thymus and body weights. LF lowered (P < 0.01) and dose dependently prevented (P < 0.001) Dex-induced hypertension. LF prevented body weight loss and significantly reduced the elevated plasma H2O2 and increased FRAP values. Chronic administration of LF strongly reduced the blood pressure and production of ROS and improved antioxidant capacity in Dex-induced hypertension, suggesting the role of inhibition of oxidative stress as another mechanism of antihypertensive action of LF.

Dextromethorphan (DM), the dextrorotatory isomer of 3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, is the main ingredient in a number of widely available, over-the-counter antitussives. Initial studies (Bornstein 1968) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability. Subsequently, however, several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature. The drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects, ranging from nausea, restlessness, insomnia, ataxia, slurred speech and nystagmus to mood changes, perceptual alterations, inattention, disorientation and aggressive behavior (Rammer et al 1988; Katona and Watson 1986; Isbell and Fraser 1953; Devlin et al 1985; McCarthy 1971; Dodds and Revai 1967; Degkwitz 1964; Hildebrand et al 1989). There have also been two reported fatalities from DM overdoses (Fleming 1986). However, there are no reports describing the effects of chronic abuse. This report describes a case of cognitive deterioration resulting from prolonged use of DM.
DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), a developmental field defect of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, is characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the thymus and parathyroid glands and by conotruncal cardiac malformations. Cytogenetic studies support the presence of a DGS critical region in band 22q11. In the present study, we report the results of clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular studies of 14 patients with DGS. Chromosome analysis, utilizing high-resolution banding techniques, detected interstitial deletions in five probands and was inconclusive for a deletion in three probands. The remaining six patients had normal karyotypes. In contrast, molecular analysis detected DNA deletions in all 14 probands. Two of 10 loci tested, D22S75 and D22S259, are deleted in all 14 patients. A third locus, D22S66, is deleted in the eight DGS probands tested. Physical mapping using somatic cell hybrids places D22S66 between D22S75 and D22S259, suggesting that it should be deleted in the remaining six cases. Parent-of-origin studies were performed in five families. Four probands failed to inherit a maternal allele, and one failed to inherit a paternal allele. On the basis of these families, and of six maternally and five paternally derived unbalanced-translocation DGS probands in the literature, parent of origin or imprinting does not appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of DGS. Deletion of the same three loci in all 14 DGS probands begins to delineate the region of chromosome 22 critical for DGS and confirms the hypothesis that submicroscopic deletions of 22q11 are etiologic in the vast majority of cases..

Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced-behaviour is poorly understood. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms. Therefore NFkappaB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate, a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction, were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats. NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats, as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus, whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased. Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex. In contrast, learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase. These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by cocaine. Topiramate prevented all the alterations observed, showing novel neuroprotective properties.
Differential Alu PCR fingerprint cloning was used to isolate a DNA probe from the Xp11. 4-- > p11. 21 region of the human X chromosome. This novel sequence, cpXr318 (DXS742), detects a new submicroscopic deletion interval at the Norrie disease locus (NDP). Combining our data with the consensus genetic map of the proximal short arm of the X chromosome, we propose the physical order Xcen-DXS14-DXS255- (DXS426, TIMP) - (DXS742- ([MAOB-MAOA-DXS7], NDP) -DXS77-DXS228) -DXS209-DXS148-DXS196- + + + Xpter. The cpXr318 probe and a subclone from a cosmid corresponding to the DXS7 locus were converted into sequence-tagged sites. Finally, DXS742, DSX7, DXS77, and MAOA were integrated into a physical map spanning the Norrie disease locus

Diffusible chemorepellents play a major role in guiding developing axons toward their correct targets by preventing them from entering or steering them away from certain regions. Genetic studies in Drosophila revealed a novel repulsive guidance system that prevents inappropriate axons from crossing the CNS midline; this repulsive system is mediated by the Roundabout (Robo) receptor and its secreted ligand Slit. In rodents, Robo and Slit are expressed in the spinal cord and Slit can repel spinal motor axons in vitro. Here, we extend these findings into higher brain centers by showing that Robo1 and Robo2, as well as Slit1 and Slit2, are often expressed in complementary patterns in the developing forebrain. Furthermore, we show that human Slit2 can repel olfactory and hippocampal axons and collapse their growth cones.
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by thymine-uraciluria in homozygous deficient patients and has been associated with a variable clinical phenotype. In order to understand the genetic and phenotypic basis for DPD deficiency, we have reviewed 17 families presenting 22 patients with complete deficiency of DPD. In this group of patients, 7 different mutations have been identified, including 2 deletions [295-298delTCAT, 1897delC], 1 splice-site mutation [IVS14 + 1G > A)] and 4 missense mutations (85T > C, 703C > T, 2658G > A, 2983G > T). Analysis of the prevalence of the various mutations among DPD patients has shown that the G-- > A point mutation in the invariant splice donor site is by far the most common (52%), whereas the other six mutations are less frequently observed. A large phenotypic variability has been observed, with convulsive disorders, motor retardation and mental retardation being the most abundant manifestations. A clear correlation between the genotype and phenotype has not been established. An altered beta-alanine, uracil and thymine homeostasis might underlie the various clinical abnormalities encountered in patients with DPD deficiency.
Dipeptidyl-peptidase I, a lysosomal cysteine proteinase, is important in intracellular degradation of proteins and appears to be a central coordinator for activation of many serine proteinases in immune/inflammatory cells. Little is known about the molecular genetics of the enzyme. In the present investigation the gene for dipeptidyl-peptidase I was cloned and characterized. The gene spans approximately 3.5 kilobases and consists of two exons and one intron. The genomic organization is distinct from the complex structures of the other members of the papain-type cysteine proteinase family. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the gene was mapped to chromosomal region 11q14.1-q14.3. Analysis of the sequenced 5'-flanking region revealed no classical TATA or CCAAT box in the GC-rich region upstream of cap site. A number of possible regulatory elements that could account for tissue-specific expression were identified. Northern analyses demonstrated that the dipeptidyl-peptidase I message is expressed at high levels in lung, kidney, and placenta, at moderate to low levels in many organs, and at barely detectable levels in the brain, suggesting tissue-specific regulation. Among immune/inflammatory cells, the message is expressed at high levels in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and alveolar macrophages and their precursor cells. Treatment of lymphocytes with interleukin-2 resulted in a significant increase in dipeptidyl-peptidase I mRNA levels, suggesting that this gene is subjected to transcriptional regulation. The results provide initial insights into the molecular basis for the regulation of human dipeptidyl-peptidase I.
Diphenhydramine prevents the haemodynamic changes of cimetidine in ICU patients.
Dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia.
Dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of peripheral vascular disease. Many of these patients are taking pentoxifylline (Trental), a methylxanthine derivative which may improve intermittent claudication. Whether pentoxifylline inhibits dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia like other methylxanthines such as theophylline and should be stopped prior to dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging is unknown. Therefore, we studied the hyperemic response to dipyridamole in seven open-chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either pentoxifylline (0, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg i.v.) or theophylline (3 mg/kg i.v.). Baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment groups. Dipyridamole significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7.5 or 15 mm/kg i.v. pentoxifylline (p less than 0.002). Neither dose of pentoxifylline significantly decreased the dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after theophylline (p less than 0.01). We conclude that pentoxyifylline does not inhibit dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia even at high doses.
Direct inhibition of cardiac hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated pacemaker channels by clonidine.
Direct sequencing of the emerin gene in 22 families with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EMD) revealed mutations in 21 (95%), confirming that emerin mutations can be identified in the majority of families with X-linked EMD. Most emerin mutations result in absence of the protein. In this study three mutations (a missense mutation Pro183Thr and two in-frame deletions removing residues 95-99 and 236-241, respectively) were unusual in being associated with expression of mutant protein. The phenotype in these families was compared in detail with the clinical features in cases with typical null mutations. For the in-frame deletions there were no significant differences. In the family with the missense mutation the phenotype was milder. Age at onset was later for first symptoms and for development of ankle contractures and muscle weakness.

Disequilibrium of dermal wound repair can result in continued accumulation of ECM and excessive scar formation. In susceptible genetically predisposed individuals, keloid formation can be observed. Keloid disease represents a benign dermal fibroproliferative tumor that is unique to humans. TGF-beta is known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease which is still not fully understood. The isoforms TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 have profibrotic properties, whereas TGF-beta3 may have antifibrotic functions. TGF-beta exerts its influence by binding to type I and type II TGF-beta receptors, thereby forming a complex and activating specific downstream effector molecules. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TGF-beta1 targeting by antisense oligonucleotides on the RNA synthesis and protein expression of TGF-beta isoforms and their receptors in keloid-derived fibroblasts. In tissue samples with normal fibroblasts (NFs) serving as control samples, expression of TGF-beta1 and -beta2 was decreased when compared to keloid fibroblasts (KFs), while expression of TGF-beta3 and of TGF-betaRII was significantly higher in NFs. In the ELISA assay, abrogation of TGF-beta1 led to a significant decrease in TGF-beta1 and -beta2 (p<0.05). Expression of TGF-beta2 mRNA was reduced. Expression of TGF-beta3 mRNA revealed contrary patterns in KFs from different patients while expression of TGF-betaRI was found to be equal during the measurement period. TGF-betaRII mRNA expression was increased after 48 and 72 h respectively. There is growing evidence for a regulatory mechanism between TGF-beta1 and its receptors. Our findings support this theory by suggesting interrelations between the different TGF-beta isoforms and their receptors. Abnormal response of KFs to TGF-betamight reflect a modification in the regulatory pathway that occurs at the receptor level or during intracellular trans-duction. Improving the understanding of TGF-beta in keloid disease could lead to the development of clinically useful therapeutic modalities for treatment of keloid disease or even allow identification of preventive strategies.

Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is an uncommon autosomal dominant chronic keratinization disorder, characterized by multiple superficial keratotic lesions surrounded by a slightly raised keratotic border. Thus far, although two loci for DSAP have been identified, the genetic basis and pathogenesis of this disorder have not been elucidated yet. In this study, we performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in three Chinese affected families and localized the gene in an 8.0 cM interval defined by D12S330 and D12S354 on chromosome 12. Upon screening 30 candidate genes, we identified a missense mutation, p.Ser63Asn in SSH1 in one family, a frameshift mutation, p.Ser19CysfsX24 in an alternative variant (isoform f) of SSH1 in another family, and a frameshift mutation, p.Pro27ProfsX54 in the same alternative variant in one non-familial case with DSAP. SSH1 encodes a phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in actin dynamics. Our data suggested that cytoskeleton disorganization in epidermal cells is likely associated with the pathogenesis of DSAP.
Dissociated learning of rats in the normal state and the state of amnesia produced by pentobarbital (15 mg/kg, ip) was carried out. Rats were trained to approach a shelf where they received food reinforcement. In Group 1 the rats were trained under the influence of pentobarbital to run to the same shelf as in the normal state. In Group 2 the rats were trained to approach different shelves in different drug states. It was shown that memory dissociation occurred in both groups. Differences in the parameters of training under the influence of pentobarbital between Groups 1 and 2 were revealed. These findings show that the brain-dissociated state induced by pentobarbital is formed with the participation of the mechanisms of information perception.

Diuretics may induce hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. While severe hypokalemia may cause muscle weakness, severe hypomagnesemia is associated with muscle spasms and tetany which cannot be corrected by potassium and calcium supplementation alone (1,2). Surreptitious diuretic ingestion has been described, mainly in women who are concerned that they are obese or edematous. Symptomatic hypokalemia has been reported in such patients (3-7) and in one case hypocalcemia was observed (8), but the effects of magnesium depletion were not noted in these patients.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a useful and safe provocation test for myocardial ischemia. Until now, the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery, and positive DSE has indicated the presence of significant fixed coronary artery stenosis. The aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial ischemia due to coronary spasm is induced by dobutamine. We performed DSE on 51 patients with coronary spastic angina but without significant fixed coronary artery stenosis. All patients had anginal attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram (variant angina). Coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine, and no fixed coronary artery stenosis was documented on angiograms in all patients. DSE was performed with intravenous dobutamine infusion with an incremental doses of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 microg/kg/min every 5 minutes. Of the 51 patients, 7 patients showed asynergy with ST elevation. All 7 patients (13.7%) had chest pain during asynergy, and both chest pain and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by asynergy. These findings indicate that dobutamine can provoke coronary spasm in some patients with coronary spastic angina. When DSE is performed to evaluate coronary artery disease, not only fixed coronary stenosis, but also coronary spasm should be considered as a genesis of asynergy.

Dominant missense mutations in the human glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha 1 subunit gene (GLRA1) give rise to hereditary hyperekplexia. These mutations impair agonist affinities and change conductance states of expressed mutant channels, resulting in a partial loss of function. In a recessive case of hyperekplexia, we found a deletion of exons 1-6 of the GLRA1 gene. Born to consanguineous parents, the affected child is homozygous for this GLRA1(null) allele consistent with a complete loss of gene function. The child displayed exaggerated startle responses and pronounced head-retraction jerks reflecting a disinhibition of vestigial brain-stem reflexes. In contrast, proprio- and exteroceptive inhibition of muscle activity previously correlated to glycinergic mechanisms were not affected. This case demonstrates that, in contrast to the lethal effect of a null allele in the recessive mouse mutant oscillator (Glra1 spd-ot), the loss of the GlyR alpha 1 subunit is effectively compensated in man.

Dopamine (DA), through D1/D2 receptor-mediated signaling, plays a major role in the control of epileptic seizures arising in the limbic system. Excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of seizures at the cellular level. In this respect, little is known about the role of DA receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy-induced neuronal cell death. Here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in D2R -/- mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine. We compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid (KA), a potent glutamate agonist. Importantly, D2R -/- mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity. However, pilocarpine-induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R -/- brains in comparison to KA. Thus, the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine. Moreover, the dopaminergic control of epilepsy-induced neurodegeneration seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D2R signaling with these two neurotransmitters.

Dose-response relationships, biochemical mechanisms, and sex differences in the experimental fatty liver induced by tetracycline were studied in the intact rat and with the isolated perfused rat liver in vitro. In the intact male and female rat, no direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and hepatic accumulation of triglyceride. With provision of adequate oleic acid as a substrate for the isolated perfused liver, a direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and both accumulation of triglyceride in the liver and depression of output of triglyceride by livers from male and female rats. Marked differences were observed between female and male rats with regard to base line (control) hepatic concentration of triglyceride and output of triglyceride. Accumulation of hepatic triglyceride, as a per cent of control values, in response to graded doses of tetracycline, did not differ significantly between male, female and pregnant rat livers. However, livers from female, and especially pregnant female rats, were strikingly resistant to the effects of tetracycline on depression of output of triglyceride under these experimental conditions. These differences between the sexes could not be related to altered disposition of tetracycline or altered uptake of oleic acid. Depressed hepatic secretion of triglyceride accounted only for 30 to 50% of accumulated hepatic triglyceride, indicating that additional mechanisms must be involved in the production of the triglyceride-rich fatty liver in response to tetracycline.

Downbeat nystagmus associated with intravenous patient-controlled administration of morphine.
Downbeat nystagmus is often associated with structural lesions at the craniocervical junction, but has occasionally been reported as a manifestation of metabolic imbalance or drug intoxication. We recorded the eye movements of two patients with reversible downbeat nystagmus related to carbamazepine therapy. The nystagmus of both patients resolved after reduction of the serum carbamazepine levels. Neuroradiologic investigations including magnetic resonance imaging scans in both patients showed no evidence of intracranial abnormality. In patients with downbeat nystagmus who are taking anticonvulsant medications, consideration should be given to reduction in dose before further investigation is undertaken.
Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy in children with left-sided Wilms tumor.
Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy-induced inflammation and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin B1 receptor.
Doxorubicin is an anti-tumor agent that represses cardiac-specific gene expression and induces myocardial cell apoptosis. Doxorubicin depletes cardiac p300, a transcriptional coactivator that is required for the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes. However, the role of p300 in protection against doxorubicin-induced apoptosis is unknown. Transgenic mice overexpressing p300 in the heart and wild-type mice were subjected to doxorubicin treatment. Compared with wild-type mice, transgenic mice exhibited higher survival rate as well as more preserved left ventricular function and cardiac expression of alpha-sarcomeric actin. Doxorubicin induced myocardial cell apoptosis in wild-type mice but not in transgenic mice. Expression of p300 increased the cardiac level of bcl-2 and mdm-2, but not that of p53 or other members of the bcl-2 family. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and reduces the extent of acute heart failure in adult mice in vivo.
Doxorubicin is an effective anticancer chemotherapeutic agent known to cause acute and chronic cardiomyopathy. To develop a more sensitive echocardiographic screening test for cardiac damage due to doxorubicin, a cohort study was performed using dobutamine infusion to differentiate asymptomatic long-term survivors of childhood cancer treated with doxorubicin from healthy control subjects. Echocardiographic data from the experimental group of 21 patients (mean age 16 +/- 5 years) treated from 1.6 to 14.3 years (median 5.3) before this study with 27 to 532 mg/m2 of doxorubicin (mean 196) were compared with echocardiographic data from 12 normal age-matched control subjects. Graded dobutamine infusions of 0.5, 2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms/kg per min were administered. Echocardiographic Doppler studies were performed before infusion and after 15 min of infusion at each rate. Dobutamine infusion at 10 micrograms/kg per min was discontinued after six studies secondary to a 50% incidence rate of adverse symptoms. The most important findings were that compared with values in control subjects, end-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension and percent of left ventricular posterior wall thickening in doxorubicin-treated patients were decreased at baseline study and these findings were more clearly delineated with dobutamine stimulation. End-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at baseline for the doxorubicin-treated group was 11 +/- 1.9 mm versus 13.1 +/- 1.5 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01). End-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at the 5-micrograms/kg per min dobutamine infusion for the doxorubicin-treated group was 14.1 +/- 2.4 mm versus 19.3 +/- 2.6 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity monitored by ECG in freely moving mice. A new model to test potential protectors.
Doxorubicin-induced nephropathy leads to epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)-dependent volume retention and renal fibrosis. The aldosterone-sensitive serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1 has been shown to participate in the stimulation of ENaC and to mediate renal fibrosis following mineralocorticoid and salt excess. The present study was performed to elucidate the role of SGK1 in the volume retention and fibrosis during nephrotic syndrome. To this end, doxorubicin (15 mug/g body wt) was injected intravenously into gene-targeted mice lacking SGK1 (sgk1(-/-)) and their wild-type littermates (sgk1(+/+)). Doxorubicin treatment resulted in heavy proteinuria (>100 mg protein/mg crea) in 15/44 of sgk1(+/+) and 15/44 of sgk1(-/-) mice leading to severe nephrotic syndrome with ascites, lipidemia, and hypoalbuminemia in both genotypes. Plasma aldosterone levels increased in nephrotic mice of both genotypes and was followed by increased SGK1 protein expression in sgk1(+/+) mice. Urinary sodium excretion reached signficantly lower values in sgk1(+/+) mice (15 +/- 5 mumol/mg crea) than in sgk1(-/-) mice (35 +/- 5 mumol/mg crea) and was associated with a significantly higher body weight gain in sgk1(+/+) compared with sgk1(-/-) mice (+6.6 +/- 0.7 vs. +4.1 +/- 0.8 g). During the course of nephrotic syndrome, serum urea concentrations increased significantly faster in sgk1(-/-) mice than in sgk1(+/+) mice leading to uremia and a reduced median survival in sgk1(-/-) mice (29 vs. 40 days in sgk1(+/+) mice). In conclusion, gene-targeted mice lacking SGK1 showed blunted volume retention, yet were not protected against renal fibrosis during experimental nephrotic syndrome.
Drosophila melanogaster serves as a useful model organism for functional genomic studies, and its genome project was recently completed. We previously described a comparative-gene-identification approach to assist human ortholog gene identification that involves applying an entire proteome as an alignment template. Analysis of the available 14100 Drosophila protein sequences revealed that 37% of them (5228 sequences) might lead to discoveries of novel human genes. Upon further database interrogations, we found several putative full-length human gene transcripts, including the human crooked neck (crn) gene. Based on sequence gap-closure experiments using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as well as bioinformatic analysis, we found that the assembled human cDNA contig of crooked neck gene was at least 3903 base pairs in length with alternative splicing variations which encoded mainly for a 687-amino-acid residue protein. The human crooked neck gene was located on chromosome 20 with at least 15 exons. The unique features of the 16 copies of the tetratrico peptide repeat (TPR) motif were conserved in the yeast, fly and human crooked neck orthologous proteins, which were important for spliceosome assembly in cells.

Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is a common cause of acute hepatitis, and the recognition of the responsible drug may be difficult. We describe a case of clopidogrel-related acute hepatitis. The diagnosis is strongly suggested by an accurate medical history and liver biopsy. Reports about cases of hepatotoxicity due to clopidogrel are increasing in the last few years, after the increased use of this drug. In conclusion, we believe that physicians should carefully consider the risk of drug-induced hepatic injury when clopidogrel is prescribed.
Drug-induced hepatotoxicity, although common, has been reported only infrequently with sulfonylureas. For glyburide, a second-generation sulfonylurea, only two brief reports of hepatotoxicity exist. Two patients with type II diabetes mellitus developed an acute hepatitis-like syndrome soon after initiation of glyburide therapy. There was no serologic evidence of viral infection, and a liver biopsy sample showed a histologic pattern consistent with drug-induced hepatitis. Both patients recovered quickly after stopping glyburide therapy and have remained well for a follow-up period of 1 year. Glyburide can produce an acute hepatitis-like illness in some persons.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder for which the biochemical defect is as yet unknown. Recently, two cloned segments of human X-chromosome DNA have been described which detect structural alterations within or near the genetic locus responsible for the disorder. Both of these cloned segments were described as tightly linked to the locus and were capable of detecting deletions in the DNA of boys affected with DMD. In an attempt to determine more precisely the occurrence of these deletions within a large population of DMD patients and the accuracy of one of the segments, DXS164 (pERT87), in determining the inheritance of the DMD X chromosome, the subclones 1, 8 and 15 were made available to many investigators throughout the world. Here we describe the combined results of more than 20 research laboratories with respect to the occurrence of deletions at the DXS164 locus in DNA samples isolated from patients with DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). The results indicate that the DXS164 locus apparently recombines with DMD 5% of the time, but is probably located between independent sites of mutation which yield DMD. The breakpoints of some deletions are delineated within the DXS164 locus, and it is evident that the deletions at the DMD locus are frequent and extremely large..
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to the absence of the dystrophin protein in striated muscle. A significant number of these mutations are premature stop codons. On the basis of the observation that aminoglycoside treatment can suppress stop codons in cultured cells, we tested the effect of gentamicin on cultured muscle cells from the mdx mouse - an animal model for DMD that possesses a premature stop codon in the dystrophin gene. Exposure of mdx myotubes to gentamicin led to the expression and localization of dystrophin to the cell membrane. We then evaluated the effects of differing dosages of gentamicin on expression and functional protection of the muscles of mdx mice. We identified a treatment regimen that resulted in the presence of dystrophin in the cell membrane in all striated muscles examined and that provided functional protection against muscular injury. To our knowledge, our results are the first to demonstrate that aminoglycosides can suppress stop codons not only in vitro but also in vivo. Furthermore, these results raise the possibility of a novel treatment regimen for muscular dystrophy and other diseases caused by premature stop codon mutations. This treatment could prove effective in up to 15% of patients with DMD..

During a ten-year period, 348 women were studied for a total of 5,877 patient months in four separate studies relating oral contraceptives to changes in hematologic parameters. Significant increases in certain factors of the blood coagulation and fibrinolysin systems (factors I,II,VII,VIII,IX, and X and plasminogen) were observed in the treated groups. Severe complications developed in four patients. All four had an abnormal blood coagulation profile, suggesting "hypercoagulability" before initiation of therapy. Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients; some increased further during therapy. One of these patients developed a myocardial infarction before receiving any medication, shortly after the base-line values were obtained. One patient developed retinopathy 19 months after she began therapy, and another developed thrombophlebitis after 27 months of therapy. The fourth patient developed thrombophlebitis 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy. All four patients were of the A or AB blood group. Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for thromboembolic episodes in patients possessing the A antigen. It appears from these data that hematologic work-ups may be useful in women who are about to start long-term oral contraceptive therapy.
During an 18-month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine (10-40 mg/kg BW/3 times weekly) for the first time were monitored for detection of audiovisual toxicity. 6 patients presented clinical symptoms of visual or auditory toxicity. Moreover, detailed ophthalmologic and audiologic studies disclosed abnormalities in 7 more asymptomatic patients. Visual toxicity was of retinal origin and was characterized by a tritan-type dyschromatopsy, sometimes associated with a loss of visual acuity and pigmentary retinal deposits. Auditory toxicity was characterized by a mid- to high-frequency neurosensorial hearing loss and the lesion was of the cochlear type. Desferrioxamine withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3, and a complete reversal of hearing loss in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3. This toxicity appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of desferrioxamine or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or aluminium serum levels. The data indicate that audiovisual toxicity is not an infrequent complication in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine. Periodical audiovisual monitoring should be performed on hemodialyzed patients receiving the drug in order to detect adverse effects as early as possible.
During the last 2 1/2 years, 38 patients with ovarian cancer were treated with a combination of cisplatinum (CPDD), 50 mg/m2, adriamycin, 30 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/m2, on day 1; and hexamethylmelamine (HMM), 6 mg/kg daily, for 14 days. Each course was repeated monthly. 2 patients had stage II, 14 stage III and 22 stage IV disease. 14 of the 38 patients were previously treated with chemotherapy, 1 with radiation, 6 with both chemotherapy and radiation, and 17 did not have any treatment before CPDD combination. 31 of the 38 cases (81.5%) demonstrated objective responses lasting for 2 months or more. These responses were partial in 19 and complete in 12 cases. Hematologic toxicity was moderate and with reversible anemia developing in 71% of patients. Gastrointestinal side effects from CPDD were universal. HMM gastrointestinal toxicity necessitated discontinuation of the drug in 5 patients. Severe nephrotoxicity was observed in 2 patients but was reversible. There were no drug-related deaths.
During the screening of a human placenta cDNA library, realized in order to isolate the P2Y(11) coding sequence, an unrelated cDNA was cloned. We identified a 1422 bp open reading frame encoding a human protein displaying 40% amino acid identity with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ssf-1, a protein involved in the second step of mRNA splicing. Sequencing of the corresponding genomic DNA showed that the gene encoding human Ssf-1 is located upstream to the P2Y(11) gene on chromosome 19p31. Comparison of the cDNA and genomic DNA sequences revealed that the human Ssf-1 gene is split into 12 exons. Northern blotting experiments showed that the 1.7 kb Ssf-1 mRNA presents an ubiquitous tissue expression. We also show that, in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, Ssf-1 mRNA is rapidly upregulated following a treatment by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and dibutyryl-cyclicAMP, two agents known to induce the granulocytic differentiation of these cells.

During treatment of chronic hepatitis C patients with interferon and ribavirin, a lot of side effects are described. Twenty-three percent to 44% of patients develop depression. A minority of patients evolve to psychosis. To the best of our knowledge, no cases of psychogenic parasitosis occurring during interferon therapy have been described in the literature. We present a 49-year-old woman who developed a delusional parasitosis during treatment with pegylated interferon alpha-2b weekly and ribavirin. She complained of seeing parasites and the larvae of fleas in her stools. This could not be confirmed by any technical examination. All the complaints disappeared after stopping pegylated interferon alpha-2b and reappeared after restarting it. She had a complete sustained viral response.
Dynamic response of blood vessel in acute renal failure.
Dysferlin, the gene product of the limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B locus, encodes a membrane-associated protein with homology to Caenorhabditis elegans fer-1. Humans with mutations in dysferlin ( DYSF ) develop muscle weakness that affects both proximal and distal muscles. Strikingly, the phenotype in LGMD 2B patients is highly variable, but the type of mutation in DYSF cannot explain this phenotypic variability. Through electronic database searching, we identified a protein highly homologous to dysferlin that we have named myoferlin. Myoferlin mRNA was highly expressed in cardiac muscle and to a lesser degree in skeletal muscle. However, antibodies raised to myoferlin showed abundant expression of myoferlin in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. Within the cell, myoferlin was associated with the plasma membrane but, unlike dysferlin, myoferlin was also associated with the nuclear membrane. Ferlin family members contain C2 domains, and these domains play a role in calcium-mediated membrane fusion events. To investigate this, we studied the expression of myoferlin in the mdx mouse, which lacks dystrophin and whose muscles undergo repeated rounds of degeneration and regeneration. We found upregulation of myoferlin at the membrane in mdx skeletal muscle. Thus, myoferlin ( MYOF ) is a candidate gene for muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy, or possibly a modifier of the muscular dystrophy phenotype.
Dysfunctional overnight memory consolidation in ecstasy users.
Dyslexia is the most common childhood learning disorder and it is a significantly heritable trait. At least nine chromosomal loci have been linked to dyslexia, and additional susceptibility loci on other chromosomes have been suggested. Within two of these loci, DYX1C1 (15q21) and ROBO1 (3p12) have recently been proposed as dyslexia candidate genes through the molecular analysis of translocation breakpoints in dyslexic individuals carrying balanced chromosomal translocations. Moreover, genetic association studies have indicated a cluster of five dyslexia candidate genes in another linkage region on chromosome 6p22, although there is currently no consensus about which of these five genes contributes to the genetic susceptibility for dyslexia. In this article, we report the identification of four new dyslexia candidate genes (PCNT, DIP2A, S100B, and PRMT2) on chromosome region 21q22.3 by FISH and SNP microarray analyses of a very small deletion in this region, which cosegregates with dyslexia in a father and his three sons.
ERGIC-53, a membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, is identical to MR60, an intracellular mannose-specific lectin of myelomonocytic cells.
ETV6, or Translocation-Ets-Leukemia (TEL), is an ETS family transcriptional repressor that is essential for establishing hematopoiesis in neonatal bone marrow, and is frequently a target of chromosomal translocations in human cancer. ETV6 is predominantly a nuclear phosphoprotein that represses transcription by binding directly to the promoters of target genes. The nuclear localization mechanism of ETV6, however, is not well understood. In this report, we provide evidence that a nuclear localization signal (NLS) exists in the C-terminal region of ETV6. ETV6 proteins with mutations outside of amino acids 332-452 localize to the nucleus, whereas proteins with mutations within amino acids 332-452 remain in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, when a fragment of ETV6 comprised of amino acids 332-452 was fused to cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase protein, the fusion protein was able to enter the nucleus. These results strongly indicate that residues 332-452 mediate nuclear localization of ETV6.
Earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma1 receptors attenuates the convulsive, lethal, locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of cocaine in mice. In contrast, the contribution of sigma2 receptors is unclear because experimental tools to selectively target this subtype are unavailable. To begin addressing this need, we characterized UMB24 (1-(2-phenethyl)-4-(2-pyridyl)-piperazine) and (+/-)-SM 21 (3alpha-tropanyl-2-(4-chorophenoxy)butyrate) in receptor binding and behavioral studies. Receptor binding studies confirmed that UMB24 and (+/-)-SM 21 display preferential affinity for sigma2 over sigma1 receptors. In behavioral studies, pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with UMB24 or (+/-)-SM 21 significantly attenuated cocaine-induced convulsions and locomotor activity, but not lethality. When administered alone, (+/-)-SM 21 produced no significant effects compared to control injections of saline, but UMB24 had locomotor depressant actions. Together, the data suggest that sigma2 receptor antagonists have the potential to attenuate some of the behavioral effects of cocaine, and further development of more selective, high affinity ligands are warranted.

Early-onset ataxia with ocular motor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia (EAOH) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early-onset ataxia, ocular motor apraxia, and hypoalbuminemia. Recently, the causative gene for EAOH, APTX, has been identified. Of the two splicing variants of APTX mRNA, the short and the long forms, long-form APTX mRNA was found to be the major isoform. Aprataxin is mainly located in the nucleus, and, furthermore, the first nuclear localization signal located near the amino terminus of the long-form aprataxin is essential for its nuclear localization. We found, based on the yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, that the long-form but not the short-form aprataxin interacts with XRCC1 (x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1). Interestingly the amino terminus of the long-form aprataxin is homologous with polynucleotidekinase-3'-phosphatase, which has been demonstrated to be involved in base excision repair, a subtype of single-strand DNA break repair, through interaction with XRCC1, DNA polymerase beta, and DNA ligase III. These results strongly support the possibility that aprataxin and XRCC1 constitute a multiprotein complex and are involved in single-strand DNA break repair, and furthermore, that accumulation of unrepaired damaged DNA underlies the pathophysiological mechanisms of EAOH.
Eating disorders and the associated behavioural problems and drug abuse are uncommon in pregnancy. When they do occur they are often unrecognized because of denial but when significant may pose a risk to both the mother and her fetus. This case illustrates a number of problems that may be encountered in women with eating disorders in pregnancy, including prolonged and recurrent metabolic disturbances and diuretic abuse. In particular it illustrates the derangements of thyroid function seen in pregnant women with eating disorders and reminds us that when a cause for thyrotoxicosis remains obscure, thyroxine abuse should be considered and explored.
Ectodysplasin is a collagenous trimeric type II membrane protein with a tumor necrosis factor-like domain and co-localizes with cytoskeletal structures at lateral and apical surfaces of cells.
Ectodysplasin, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, is encoded by the anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) gene. Mutations in EDA give rise to a clinical syndrome characterized by loss of hair, sweat glands, and teeth. EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are two isoforms of ectodysplasin that differ only by an insertion of two amino acids. This insertion functions to determine receptor binding specificity, such that EDA-A1 binds only the receptor EDAR, whereas EDA-A2 binds only the related, but distinct, X-linked ectodysplasin-A2 receptor (XEDAR). In situ binding and organ culture studies indicate that EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are differentially expressed and play a role in epidermal morphogenesis.

Effect of ketamine on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery. Injections of ketamine in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a depression of the SA nodal activity by a direct action. This depression was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase. Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine-induced tachycardia, while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta-blocking agent into the SA node artery. This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of ketamine injected in the SA node artery.

Effect of methanolic extract of Hibiscus rosa sinensis (100-300 mg/kg) was studied on reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and neurochemical alterations. The rats were treated with intraperitoneal reserpine (1 mg/kg, ip) for 3 days every other day. On day 5, vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions were counted for 5 min. Reserpine treated rats significantly developed vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions however, coadministration of Hibiscus rosa sinensis roots extract (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg, per orally) attenuated the effects. Biochemical analysis of brain revealed that the reserpine treatment significantly increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GSH), an index of oxidative stress process. Coadministration of extract significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and reversed the decrease in brain SOD, CAT and GSH levels. The results of the present study suggested that Hibiscus rosa sinensis had a protective role against reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and oxidative stress.

Effective topical antimicrobial agents decrease infection and mortality in burn patients. Chlorhexidine phosphanilate (CHP), a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, has been evaluated as a topical burn wound dressing in cream form, but preliminary clinical trials reported that it was painful upon application. This study compared various concentrations of CHP to determine if a tolerable concentration could be identified with retention of antimicrobial efficacy. Twenty-nine burn patients, each with two similar burns which could be separately treated, were given pairs of treatments at successive 12-h intervals over a 3-day period. One burn site was treated with each of four different CHP concentrations, from 0.25 per cent to 2 per cent, their vehicle, and 1 per cent silver sulphadiazine (AgSD) cream, an antimicrobial agent frequently used for topical treatment of burn wounds. The other site was always treated with AgSD cream. There was a direct relationship between CHP concentration and patients' ratings of pain on an analogue scale. The 0.25 per cent CHP cream was closest to AgSD in pain tolerance; however, none of the treatments differed statistically from AgSD or from each other. In addition, ease of application of CHP creams was less satisfactory than that of AgSD. It was concluded that formulations at or below 0.5 per cent CHP may prove acceptable for wound care, but the vehicle system needs pharmaceutical improvement to render it more tolerable and easier to use.
Effects of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE) on the neutral and acidic biosynthetic pathways of bile salt (BS) synthesis were evaluated in rats with an intact enterohepatic circulation and in rats with long-term bile diversion to induce BS synthesis. For this purpose, bile salt pool composition, synthesis of individual BS in vivo, hepatic activities, and expression levels of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A), and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27), as well as of other enzymes involved in BS synthesis, were analyzed in rats treated with EE (5 mg/kg, 3 days) or its vehicle. BS pool size was decreased by 27% but total BS synthesis was not affected by EE in intact rats. Synthesis of cholate was reduced by 68% in EE-treated rats, while that of chenodeoxycholate was increased by 60%. The recently identified Delta22-isomer of beta-muricholate contributed for 5.4% and 18.3 % (P < 0.01) to the pool in control and EE-treated rats, respectively, but could not be detected in bile after exhaustion of the pool. A clear reduction of BS synthesis was found in bile-diverted rats treated with EE, yet biliary BS composition was only minimally affected. Activity of CYP7A was decreased by EE in both intact and bile-diverted rats, whereas the activity of the CYP27 was not affected. Hepatic mRNA levels of CYP7A were significantly reduced by EE in bile-diverted rats only; CYP27 mRNA levels were not affected by EE. In addition, mRNA levels of sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase and lithocholate 6beta-hydroxylase were increased by bile diversion and suppressed by EE. This study shows that 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE)-induced intrahepatic cholestasis in rats is associated with selective inhibition of the neutral pathway of bile salt (BS) synthesis. Simultaneous impairment of other enzymes in the BS biosynthetic pathways may contribute to overall effects of EE on BS synthesis.

Effects of CD-832 on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial ischemia were studied in dogs with partial coronary stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery and findings were compared with those for nifedipine or diltiazem. In the presence of coronary artery stenosis, 3-min periods of intracoronary ISO infusion (10 ng/kg/min) increased heart rate and maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise, which resulted in a decrease in percentage segmental shortening and ST-segment elevation of the epicardial electrocardiogram. After the control ISO infusion with stenosis was performed, equihypotensive doses of CD-832 (3 and 10 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7), nifedipine (1 and 3 micrograms/kg/min, n = 9) or diltiazem (10 and 30 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7) were infused 5 min before and during the second and third ISO infusion. Both CD-832 and diltiazem, but not nifedipine, significantly reduced the increase in heart rate induced by ISO infusion. In contrast to nifedipine, CD-832 (10 micrograms/kg/min) prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 32 +/- 12% to 115 +/- 26% of the control value (P < .01) and ST-segment elevation from 5.6 +/- 1.0 mV to 1.6 +/- 1.3 mV (P < .01) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis. Diltiazem (30 micrograms/kg/min) also prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 34 +/- 14% to 63 +/- 18% of the control value (P < .05) and ST-segment elevation from 4.7 +/- 0.7 mV to 2.1 +/- 0.7 mV (P < .01) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis. These data show that CD-832 improves myocardial ischemia during ISO infusion with stenosis and suggest that the negative chronotropic property of CD-832 plays a major role in the beneficial effects of CD-832.

Eight Alu sequences (ACE, TPA25, PV92, APO, FXIIIB, D1, A25 and B65) were analyzed in two samples from Navarre and Guipuzcoa provinces (Basque Country, Spain). Alu data for other European, Caucasus and North African populations were compiled from the literature for comparison purposes to assess the genetic relationships of the Basques in a broader geographic context. Results of both MDS plot and AMOVA revealed spatial heterogeneity among these three population clusters clearly defined by geography. On the contrary, no substantial genetic heterogeneity was found between the Basque samples, or between Basques and other Europeans (excluding Caucasus populations). Moreover, the genetic information obtained from Alu data conflicts with hypotheses linking the origin of Basques with populations from North Africa (Berbers) or from the Caucasus region (Georgia). In order to explain the reduced genetic heterogeneity detected by Alu insertions among Basque subpopulations, values of the Wright's F(ST )statistic were estimated for both Alu markers and a set of short tandem repeats (STRs) in terms of two geographical scales: (1) the Basque Country, (2) Europe (including Basques). In the Basque area, estimates of Wahlund's effect for both genetic markers showed no statistical difference between Basque subpopulations. However, when this analysis was performed on a European scale, F(ST) values were significantly higher for Alu insertions than for STR alleles. From these results, we suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of the Basque gene pool identified in previous polymorphism studies is relatively recent and probably caused by a differential process of genetic admixture with non-Basque neighboring populations modulated by the effect of a linguistic barrier to random mating.
Eight cancer patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous morphine developed hyperalgesia. All cases were retrospectively sampled from three different hospitals in Copenhagen. Five patients developed universal hyperalgesia and hyperesthesia which in 2 cases were accompanied by myoclonus. In 3 patients a pre-existing neuralgia increased to excruciating intensity and in 2 of these cases myoclonus occurred simultaneously. Although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between hyperalgesia/myoclonus and high doses of morphine are available, experimental support from animal studies indicates that morphine, or its metabolites, plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome. The possible mechanisms are discussed and treatment proposals given suggesting the use of more efficacious opioids with less excitatory potency in these situations.
Eight novel inactivating germ line mutations at the APC gene identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
Eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life-threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs, either phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressants. Although most patients were receiving several drugs, Mellaril (thioridazine) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia, one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman. Supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving Thorazine (chlorpromazine). Aventyl (nortriptyline) and Elavil (amitriptyline) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old woman. Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients. The ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in one. The tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped. Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger; only one clearly had antecedent heart disease. Major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs. A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressant drugs.
Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the DMD locus. This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7, all exons detected by cDNA8, and the first two exons detected by cDNA9. These 80 individuals account for approximately 75% of 109 deletions of the gene, detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA. Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; present paper). Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Of these, eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame. Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions. This is in agreement with recent findings by Baumbach et al. and Koenig et al. but is in contrast to findings, by Malhotra et al. at the 5 ' end of the gene.
Eighty-nine new referral hypertensive out-patients and 46 new referral non-hypertensive chronically physically ill out-patients completed a mood rating scale at regular intervals for one year. The results showed a high prevalence of depression in both groups of patients, with no preponderance in the hypertensive group. Hypertensive patients with psychiatric histories had a higher prevalence of depression than the comparison patients. This was accounted for by a significant number of depressions occurring in methyl dopa treated patients with psychiatric histories.
Eighty-one renal, seventeen heart, and twenty-four liver transplant patients were followed for infection. Seventeen renal patients received azathioprine (Aza) and prednisone as part of a randomized trial of immunosuppression with 21 cyclosporine-and-prednisone-treated renal transplant patients. All others received cyclosporine and prednisone. The randomized Aza patients had more overall infections (P less than 0.05) and more nonviral infections (P less than 0.02) than the randomized cyclosporine patients. Heart and liver patients had more infections than cyclosporine renal patients but fewer infections than the Aza renal patients. There were no infectious deaths in renal transplant patients on cyclosporine or Aza, but infection played a major role in 3 out of 6 cardiac transplant deaths and in 8 out of 9 liver transplant deaths. Renal patients on cyclosporine had the fewest bacteremias. Analysis of site of infection showed a preponderance of abdominal infections in liver patients, intrathoracic infections in heart patients, and urinary tract infections in renal patients. Pulmonary infections were less common in cyclosporine-treated renal patients than in Aza-treated patients (P less than 0.05). Aza patients had significantly more staphylococcal infections than all other transplant groups (P less than 0.005), and systemic fungal infections occurred only in the liver transplant group. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) shedding or serological rises in antibody titer, or both occurred in 78% of cyclosporine patients and 76% of Aza patients. Of the cyclosporine patients, 15% had symptoms related to CMV infection. Serological evidence for Epstein Barr Virus infection was found in 20% of 65 cyclosporine patients studied. Three had associated symptoms, and one developed a lymphoma.

Electrocardiographic changes after dipyridamole infusion (0.568 mg/kg/4 min) were studied in 41 patients with coronary artery disease and compared with those after submaximal treadmill exercise by use of the body surface mapping technique. Patients were divided into three groups; 19 patients without myocardial infarction (non-MI group), 14 with anterior infarction (ANT-MI) and eight with inferior infarction (INF-MI). Eighty-seven unipolar electrocardiograms (ECGs) distributed over the entire thoracic surface were simultaneously recorded. After dipyridamole, ischemic ST-segment depression (0.05 mV or more) was observed in 84% of the non-MI group, 29% of the ANT-MI group, 63% of the INF-MI group and 61% of the total population. Exercise-induced ST depression was observed in 84% of the non-MI group, 43% of the ANT-MI group, 38% of the INF-MI group and 61% of the total. For individual patients, there were no obvious differences between the body surface distribution of ST depression in both tests. The increase in pressure rate product after dipyridamole was significantly less than that during the treadmill exercise. The data suggest that the dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia is caused by the inhomogenous distribution of myocardial blood flow. We conclude that the dipyridamole ECG test is as useful as the exercise ECG test for the assessment of coronary artery disease.

Emerin deficiency at the nuclear membrane in patients with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.
Emerin is a nuclear membrane protein which is missing or defective in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). It is one member of a family of lamina-associated proteins which includes LAP1, LAP2 and lamin B receptor (LBR). A panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been mapped to six specific sites throughout the emerin molecule using phage-displayed peptide libraries and has been used to localize emerin in human and rabbit heart. Several mAbs against different emerin epitopes did not recognize intercalated discs in the heart, though they recognized cardiomyocyte nuclei strongly, both at the rim and in intranuclear spots or channels. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum against emerin did recognize both nuclear membrane and intercalated discs but, after affinity purification against a pure-emerin band on a western blot, it stained only the nuclear membrane. These results would not be expected if immunostaining at intercalated discs were due to a product of the emerin gene and, therefore, cast some doubt upon the hypothesis that cardiac defects in EDMD are caused by absence of emerin from intercalated discs. Although emerin was abundant in the membranes of cardiomyocyte nuclei, it was absent from many non-myocyte cells in the heart. This distribution of emerin was similar to that of lamin A, a candidate gene for an autosomal form of EDMD. In contrast, lamin B1 was absent from cardiomyocyte nuclei, showing that lamin B1 is not essential for localization of emerin to the nuclear lamina. Lamin B1 is also almost completely absent from skeletal muscle nuclei. In EDMD, the additional absence of lamin B1 from heart and skeletal muscle nuclei which already lack emerin may offer an alternative explanation of why these tissues are particularly affected..
Emerin, deficiency of which causes Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, is localized at the inner nuclear membrane.
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is an X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy characterized by early contractures of the elbows, Achilles tendons and spine, slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness, and cardiomyopathy associated with cardiac conduction defects. The emerin gene has been mapped to Xq28 and encodes a 34-kDa serine-rich protein, emerin, which has been localized to the nuclear envelope in a wide variety of tissues, including skeletal and cardiac muscle. Mutations spanning the emerin gene have been identified in patients with EDMD. We present here the effect, on emerin protein expression, of two missense mutations identified in unrelated EDMD patients. These alterations predict the replacement of a proline residue at position 183 with either a histidine or a threonine. Biochemical analysis has demonstrated that the mobility and expression levels of the mutant forms of emerin are indistinguishable from that of wild-type emerin, but that they have weakened interactions with nuclear lamina components. In comparison with the usual EDMD phenotype, patients with P183 missense mutations have a later age at onset of first symptoms, elbow contractures, ankle contractures, upper limb weakness and lower limb weakness, but there is no difference for the age at onset of cardiac involvement. This is the first report of protein studies on patients with missense mutations resulting in the clinical features of EDMD. These studies demonstrate the importance of proline 183 for the proper structure/function of emerin..

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) using calcineurin-based immunotherapy: risk of development and treatment.
Endocrine neoplasms have been reported occasionally in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). An adrenocorotical carcinoma was studied in a patient with a family history of FAP. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the region close to the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene was detected in this carcinoma, and evidence was obtained that there was a loss of the normal allele of the APC gene. This is the first demonstration of LOH at the APC locus in adrenocortical tumors. The present results and our previous data on LOH in a recurring desmoid tumor suggest that the heterozygous mutant/wild-type condition of the APC gene may give rise to benign tumors, and that functional loss of this gene leads to development of tumors not only in the colon but also in other various parts of the body in FAP patients..
Endocrine screening in 1,022 men with erectile dysfunction: clinical significance and cost-effective strategy.
Endogenous dopamine plays a central role in salience coding during associative learning. Administration of the dopamine precursor levodopa enhances learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients. Because levodopa increases both phasic and tonic dopaminergic neurotransmission, the critical mechanism mediating the enhancement of learning is unresolved. We here probed how selective tonic dopaminergic stimulation affects associative learning. Forty healthy subjects were trained in a novel vocabulary of 45 concrete nouns over the course of 5 consecutive training days in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Subjects received the tonically stimulating dopamine-receptor agonist pergolide (0.1 mg) vs placebo 120 min before training on each training day. The dopamine agonist significantly impaired novel word learning compared to placebo. This learning decrement persisted up to the last follow-up 4 weeks post-training. Subjects treated with pergolide also showed restricted emotional responses compared to the PLACEBO group. The extent of 'flattened' affect with pergolide was related to the degree of learning inhibition. These findings suggest that tonic occupation of dopamine receptors impairs learning by competition with phasic dopamine signals. Thus, phasic signaling seems to be the critical mechanism by which dopamine enhances associative learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients.
Endometrial carcinoma after Hodgkin disease in childhood.
Endothelial cell costimulation of T cell activation through CD58-CD2 interactions involves lipid raft aggregation.
Endothelial cells contain a cell-volume sensitive chloride conductance with biophysical properties similar to those of a ubiquitously expressed chloride current that is activated by cell swelling. The latter current has been associated with the ICln protein (pICln) which may be the chloride channel itself or, alternatively, a channel regulator. We were therefore interested in whether pICln is involved in the endothelial volume-sensitive chloride current. As a first step, we have cloned human pICln and studied its expression at the protein level. Using a polyclonal antiserum raised against human pICln we found a widespread expression of pICln, both in endothelial cells and in other cell lines. A characteristic feature of pICln is its anomalous migration during denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We also demonstrate that bacterially expressed pICln forms homomeric complexes in vitro.

Enhancer II (ENII) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the essential cis-elements for the transcriptional regulation of HBV gene expression. Its function is highly liver-specific, suggesting that liver-enriched transcriptional factors play critical roles in regulating the activity of ENII. In this report, a novel hepatocyte transcription factor, which binds specifically to the B1 region (AACGACCGACCTTGAG) within the major functional unit (B unit) of ENII, has been cloned from a human liver cDNA library by yeast one-hybrid screening, and demonstrated to trans-activate ENII via the B1 region. We named this factor hB1F, for human B1-binding factor. Amino acid analysis revealed this factor structurally belongs to nuclear receptor superfamily. Based on the sequence similarities, hB1F is characterized to be a novel human homolog of the orphan receptor fushi tarazu factor I (FTZ-F1). Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, a splicing isoform of hB1F (hB1F-2) was identified, which has an extra 46 amino acid residues in the A/B region. Examination of the tissue distribution has revealed an abundant 5.2-kilobase transcript of hB1F is present specifically in human pancreas and liver. Interestingly, an additional transcript of 3.8 kilobases was found to be present in hepatoma cells HepG2. Fluorescent in situ hybridization has mapped the gene locus of hB1F to the region q31-32.1 of human chromosome 1. Altogether, this study provides the first report that a novel human homolog of FTZ-F1 binds and regulates ENII of HBV. The potential roles of this FTZ-F1 homolog in tissue-specific gene regulation, in embryonic development, as well as in liver carcinogenesis are discussed.
Enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA), known as the most common form of inner ear abnormality, has recently been of particular genetic interest because this anomaly is inherited in a recessive manner. The locus for non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss with EVA has been mapped to the same chromosomal region, 7q31, as the Pendred syndrome locus. In the present study, seven mutations in the PDS gene (PDS), the gene responsible for Pendred syndrome, have been found in families of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss with EVA. One family is homozygous, three families are compound heterozygotes, and two families are heterozygous but with no other mutation detected. The present results provide evidence that mutations in PDS cause both syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss..

Epidemiological evidence indicates that prenatal nutritional deprivation may increase the risk of schizophrenia. The goal of these studies was to use an animal model to examine the effects of prenatal protein deprivation on behaviors and receptor binding with relevance to schizophrenia. We report that prenatally protein deprived (PD) female rats showed an increased stereotypic response to apomorphine and an increased locomotor response to amphetamine in adulthood. These differences were not observed during puberty. No changes in haloperidol-induced catalepsy or MK-801-induced locomotion were seen following PD. In addition, PD female rats showed increased (3)H-MK-801 binding in the striatum and hippocampus, but not in the cortex. PD female rats also showed increased (3)H-haloperidol binding and decreased dopamine transporter binding in striatum. No statistically significant changes in behavior or receptor binding were found in PD males with the exception of increased (3)H-MK-801 binding in cortex. This animal model may be useful to explore the mechanisms by which prenatal nutritional deficiency enhances risk for schizophrenia in humans and may also have implications for developmental processes leading to differential sensitivity to drugs of abuse.

Epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) has been used to prevent rebleeding in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Although this agent does decrease the frequency of rebleeding, several reports have described thrombotic complications of EACA therapy. These complications have included clinical deterioration and intracranial vascular thrombosis in patients with SAH, arteriolar and capillary fibrin thrombi in patients with fibrinolytic syndromes treated with EACA, or other thromboembolic phenomena. Since intravascular fibrin thrombi are often observed in patients with fibrinolytic disorders, EACA should not be implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrin thrombi in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation or other "consumption coagulopathies." This report describes subtotal infarction of the kidney due to thrombosis of a normal renal artery. This occlusion occurred after EACA therapy in a patient with SAH and histopathological documentation of recurrent SAH. The corresponding clinical event was characterized by marked hypertension and abrupt neurological deterioration.
Erectile dysfunction occurs following substantia nigra lesions in the rat.
Erectile function was assessed 6 weeks following uni- and bilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine in the substantia nigra nucleus of the brain. Behavioral apomorphine-induced penile erections were reduced (5/8) and increased (3/8) in uni- and bilateral lesioned animals. Intracavernous pressures, following electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve, decreased in lesioned animals. Lesions of the substantia nigra were confirmed by histology. Concentration of dopamine and its metabolites were decreased in the striatum of substantia nigra lesioned rats. Lesions of the substantia nigra are therefore associated with erectile dysfunction in rats and may serve as a model to study erectile dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
Erythema multiforme and hypersensitivity myocarditis caused by ampicillin.
Erythema nodosum associated with all- trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is very rare. We describe four patients with classic APL who developed erythema nodosum during ATRA therapy. Fever and subsequent multiple painful erythematous nodules over extremities developed on D11, D16, D17, and D19, respectively, after ATRA therapy. The skin biopsy taken from each patient was consistent with erythema nodosum. All patients received short course of steroids. Fever subsided rapidly and the skin lesions regressed completely. All patients achieved complete remission without withdrawal of ATRA. ATRA seemed to be the most possible etiology of erythema nodosum in our patients. Short-term use of steroid is very effective in ATRA-induced erythema nodosum.
Erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was characterized in blood samples obtained from 97 randomly selected males with enzyme deficiency from various regions of Guangdong Province, China. Nine new variants (Gd Kaiping, Gd Boluo, Gd Huiyang, Gd Gaomin, Gd Qing-Baijiang, Gd Gaozhou, Gd Huazhou, Gd Nanhai, and Gd Guangzhou) were identified. Of the 31 variants found in this province, Gd Kaiping, Gd Taiwan-Hakka, Gd Haad Yai, Gd Haad Yai-like and Gd Huiyang occurred most frequently. The frequency of each variant was calculated. The results demonstrated that the genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency was high in this area..

Eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093, S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide) is a novel antiepileptic drug, now in Phase III clinical trials, designed with the aim of improving efficacy and safety in comparison with the structurally related drugs carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC). We have studied the effects of oral treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate on a whole-animal model in which partial seizures can be elicited repeatedly on different days without changes in threshold or seizure patterns. In the animals treated with threshold doses of picrotoxin, the average number of seizures was 2.3+/-1.2, and average seizure duration was 39.5+/-8.4s. Pre-treatment with a dose of 30 mg/kg 2h before picrotoxin microperfusion prevented seizures in the 75% of the rats. Lower doses (3 and 10mg/kg) did not suppress seizures, however, after administration of 10mg/kg, significant reductions in seizures duration (24.3+/-6.8s) and seizure number (1.6+/-0.34) were found. No adverse effects of eslicarbazepine acetate were observed in the behavioral/EEG patterns studied, including sleep/wakefulness cycle, at the doses studied.
Essential fructosuria is one of the oldest known inborn errors of metabolism. It is a benign condition which is believed to result from deficiency of hepatic fructokinase (ketohexokinase, KHK, E. C. 2. 7. 1. 3). This enzyme catalyses the first step of metabolism of dietary fructose, conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate. Despite the early recognition of this disorder, the primary structure of human KHK and the molecular basis of essential fructosuria have not been previously defined. In this report, the isolation and sequencing of full-length cDNA clones encoding human ketohexokinase are described. Alternative mRNA species and alternative KHK isozymes are produced by alternative polyadenylation and splicing of the KHK gene. The KHK proteins show a high level of sequence conservation relative to rat KHK. Direct evidence that mutation of the KHK structural gene is the cause of essential fructosuria was also obtained. In a well-characterized family, in which three of eight siblings have fructosuria, all affected individuals are compound heterozygotes for two mutations Gly40Arg and Ala43Thr. Both mutations result from G-- > A transitions, and each alters the same conserved region of the KHK protein. Neither mutation was seen in a sample of 52 unrelated control individuals. An additional conservative amino acid change (Val49IIe) was present on the KHK allele bearing Ala43Thr

Estradiol reduces seizure-induced hippocampal injury in ovariectomized female but not in male rats.
Estrogen binding sites were demonstrated by autoradiography in one transplantable and five primary diethylstilbesterol induced renal carcinomas in three hamsters. Radiolabelling, following the in vivo injection of 3H-17 beta estradiol, was increased only over the nuclei of tumor cells; stereologic analysis revealed a 4.5- to 6.7-times higher concentration of reduced silver grains over nuclei than cytoplasm of these cells. Despite rapid tubular excretion of estradiol which peaked in less than 1 h, the normal cells did not appear to bind the ligand. This is the first published report documenting the preferential in vivo binding of estrogen to nuclei of cells in estrogen induced hamster renal carcinomas.
Estrogen prevents cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages induced by the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir.
Estrogen receptor (ER)-binding fragments were isolated from human genomic DNA by using a recombinant ER protein. Using one of these fragments as a probe, we have identified an estrogen-responsive gene that encodes a putative zinc finger protein. It has a RING finger motif present in a family of apparent DNA-binding proteins and is designated estrogen-responsive finger protein (efp). efp cDNA contains a consensus estrogen-responsive element at the 3' untranslated region that can act as a downstream estrogen-dependent enhancer. Moreover, efp is regulated by estrogen as demonstrated at both the mRNA and the protein level in ER-positive cells derived from mammary gland. These data suggest that efp may represent an estrogen-responsive transcription factor that mediates phenotypic expression of the diverse estrogen action. Thus, the genomic binding-site cloning may be applicable for isolation of the target genes of other transcription factors.
Estrogens protect ovariectomized rats from hippocampal injury induced by kainic acid-induced status epilepticus (SE). We compared the effects of 17beta-estradiol in adult male and ovariectomized female rats subjected to lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE. Rats received subcutaneous injections of 17beta-estradiol (2 microg/rat) or oil once daily for four consecutive days. SE was induced 20 h following the second injection and terminated 3 h later. The extent of silver-stained CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons was evaluated 2 days after SE. 17beta-Estradiol did not alter the onset of first clonus in ovariectomized rats but accelerated it in males. 17beta-Estradiol reduced the argyrophilic neurons in the CA1 and CA3-C sectors of ovariectomized rats. In males, estradiol increased the total damage score. These findings suggest that the effects of estradiol on seizure threshold and damage may be altered by sex-related differences in the hormonal environment.
Estrogens, which have been associated with several types of human and animal cancers, can induce tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of Fischer 344 rats. The mechanistic details of tumor angiogenesis induction, during estrogen carcinogenesis, are still unknown. To elucidate the role of estrogen in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats, the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen (FVIIIRAg) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. The expression of VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2/Flk-1/KDR) was also examined by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol (E2) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF/VPF protein expression in the E2 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats. VEGF/VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin (UEA1) binding studies, indicate that the elevation of VEGF protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non-endothelial cells. After 15 days of E2 exposure, VEGF/VPF protein expression, in the non-endothelial cell population, sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels. The function of non-endothelial-derived VEGF is not clear. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR-2 (flk-1/KDR), expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of E2 exposure. These findings suggest that over expression of VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR-2) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of estrogen induced tumor angiogenesis in the rat pituitary.

Ethambutol and optic neuropathy.
Ethambutol is known to cause optic neuropathy and, more rarely, axonal polyneuropathy. We characterize the clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging findings in a 72-year-old man who developed visual loss and paresthesias after 11 weeks of exposure to a supratherapeutic dose of ethambutol. This case demonstrates the selective vulnerability of the anterior visual pathways and peripheral nerves to ethambutol toxicity.

Etodolac (E), is a non-narcotic analgesic and antiinflammatory drug. A biodegradable polymer dextran has been utilized as a carrier for synthesis of etodolac-dextran conjugates (ED) to improve its aqueous solubility and reduce gastrointestinal side effects. An activated moiety, i.e. N-acylimidazole derivative of etodolac (EAI), was condensed with the polysaccharide polymer dextran of different molecular weights (40000, 60000, 110000 and 200000). IR spectral data confirmed formation of ester bonding in the conjugates. Etodolac contents were evaluated by UV-spectrophotometric analysis. The molecular weights were determined by measuring viscosity using the Mark-Howink-Sakurada equation. In vitro hydrolysis of ED was done in aqueous buffers (pH 1.2, 7.4, 9) and in 80% (v/v) human plasma (pH 7.4). At pH 9, a higher rate of etodolac release from ED was observed as compared to aqueous buffer of pH 7.4 and 80% human plasma (pH 7.4), following first-order kinetics. In vivo investigations were performed in animals. Acute analgesic and antiinflammatory activities were ascertained using acetic acid induced writhing model (mice) and carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model, respectively. In comparison to control, E and ED1-ED4 showed highly significant analgesic and antiinflammatory activities (p <0.001). Biological evaluation suggested that conjugates (ED1-ED4) retained comparable analgesic and antiinflammatory activities with remarkably reduced ulcerogenicity as compared to their parent drug--etodolac.
Etomidate: a foreshortened clinical trial.
Etoposide (VP-16-213) has been used in the treatment of many solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. When used in high doses and in conjunction with autologous bone marrow transplantation, this agent has activity against several treatment-resistant cancers including malignant glioma. In six of eight patients (75%) who we treated for recurrent or resistant glioma, sudden severe neurologic deterioration occurred. This developed a median of 9 days after initiation of high-dose etoposide therapy. Significant clinical manifestations have included confusion, papilledema, somnolence, exacerbation of motor deficits, and sharp increase in seizure activity. These abnormalities resolved rapidly after initiation of high-dose intravenous dexamethasone therapy. In all patients, computerized tomographic (CT) brain scans demonstrated stability in tumor size and peritumor edema when compared with pretransplant scans. This complication appears to represent a significant new toxicity of high-dose etoposide therapy for malignant glioma.
Etoposide-related myocardial infarction.
Eukaryotes respond to the presence of unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by up-regulating the transcription of genes encoding ER protein chaperones, such as BiP. We have isolated a novel human cDNA encoding a homolog to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ire1p, a proximal sensor for this signal transduction pathway in yeast. The gene product hIre1p is a type 1 transmembrane protein containing a cytoplasmic domain that is highly conserved to the yeast counterpart having a Ser/Thr protein kinase domain and a domain homologous to RNase L. However, the luminal domain has extensively diverged from the yeast gene product. hIre1p expressed in mammalian cells displayed intrinsic autophosphorylation activity and an endoribonuclease activity that cleaved the 5' splice site of yeast HAC1 mRNA, a substrate for the endoribonuclease activity of yeast Ire1p. Overexpressed hIre1p was localized to the ER with particular concentration around the nuclear envelope and some colocalization with the nuclear pore complex. Expression of Ire1p mRNA was autoregulated through a process that required a functional hIre1p kinase activity. Finally, overexpression of wild-type hIre1p constitutively activated a reporter gene under transcriptional control of the rat BiP promoter, whereas expression of a catalytically inactive hIre1p acted in a trans-dominant-negative manner to prevent transcriptional activation of the BiP promoter in response to ER stress induced by inhibition of N-linked glycosylation. These results demonstrate that hIre1p is an essential proximal sensor of the unfolded protein response pathway in mammalian cells.
Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is a key component of the translational machinery and an important modulator of cell growth and proliferation. The activity of eIF4E is thought to be regulated by interaction with inhibitory binding proteins (4E-BPs) and phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-interacting kinase (MNK) on Ser209 in response to mitogens and cellular stress. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of eIF4E via MNK1 is mediated via the activation of either the Erk or p38 pathway. We further show that expression of active mutants of MNK1 and MNK2 in 293 cells diminishes cap-dependent translation relative to cap-independent translation in a transient reporter assay. The same effect on cap-dependent translation was observed when MNK1 was activated by the Erk or p38 pathway. In line with these findings, addition of recombinant active MNK1 to rabbit reticulocyte lysate resulted in a reduced protein synthesis in vitro, and overexpression of MNK2 caused a decreased rate of protein synthesis in 293 cells. By using CGP 57380, a novel low-molecular-weight kinase inhibitor of MNK1, we demonstrate that eIF4E phosphorylation is not crucial to the formation of the initiation complex, mitogen-stimulated increase in cap-dependent translation, and cell proliferation. Our results imply that activation of MNK by MAP kinase pathways does not constitute a positive regulatory mechanism to cap-dependent translation. Instead, we propose that the kinase activity of MNKs, eventually through phosphorylation of eIF4E, may serve to limit cap-dependent translation under physiological conditions.
Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF-5) interacts with the 40 S initiation complex (40S.mRNA.MettRNAf.eIF-2.GTP) to promote the hydrolysis of bound GTP with the concomitant joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 40 S initiation complex to form a functional 80 S initiation complex. In this paper, the multiple mRNAs that encode mammalian eIF-5 have been characterized. In rat tissues, three major eIF-5 mRNAs of 3.5, 2.8, and 2.2 kilobases in length are detected. All major eIF-5 mRNAs are initiated from a single transcription initiation site, contain identical 5'-untranslated and coding regions, but differ from one another only in the length of their 3'-untranslated regions. The different lengths of the 3'-untranslated region of eIF-5 mRNAs are generated by the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. Additionally, we demonstrate tissue-specific variations in eIF-5 mRNA expression as well as preference for polyadenylation sites. These results should lead to increased understanding of the regulation of eIF-5 gene expression.

Examination on G6PD deficiency in 349 patients of Shekii district hospital (Azerbaijan) revealed 16 hemi-, 4 homo- and 9 heterozygotic carriers of the defect. Gd- frequency, calculated from the data obtained (7. 7%), may be compared to neighbouring regions frequencies (6-30%). Carriers of G6PD deficiency are residents of 11 villages located in Alasani-Aphtalan valley, highly endemic with malaria in the past; nearly all marriages are endogamic. Physico-chemical and kinetic study of 10 mutant forms of G6PD, according to WHO program, led to identification of 5 variants of the II class (Shekii, Bideiz, Shirin-Bulakh, Okhut I and Zakataly) and 2 variants of the III class (Okhut II and Martinique-like). Resemblance of the majority of variants in electrophoretic mobility and the level of erythrocyte enzyme activity permit to suggest the existence of a common parental mutant G6PD allele distributed in this area.
Excessive placental secretion of neurokinin B during the third trimester causes pre-eclampsia.
Excessive stimulation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors causes a syndrome of serotonin excess that consists of shivering, muscle rigidity, salivation, confusion, agitation and hyperthermia. The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. We report a venlafaxine-MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression. He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1/2 tab of venlafaxine. Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities, tremors and rigidity. He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering, myoclonic jerks, rigidity, salivation and diaphoresis. His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light. Vital signs were: blood pressure 120/67 mm Hg, heart rate 127/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and temperature 97 F. After 180 mg of diazepam i.v. he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws. He was intubated for airway protection and because of hypoventilation, and was paralyzed to control muscle rigidity. His subsequent course was remarkable for non-immune thrombocytopenia which resolved. The patient's maximal temperature was 101.2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units/L with no other evidence of rhabdomyolysis. His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward. This patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular paralysis.

Exon 9 mutations in the WT1 gene, without influencing KTS splice isoforms, are also responsible for Frasier syndrome.
Exon trapping was used to clone portions of potential genes from human chromosome 21. One trapped sequence showed striking homology with the bovine and rat ATP synthase OSCP (oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein) subunit. We subsequently cloned the full-length human ATP synthase OSCP cDNA (GDB/HGMW approved name ATP50) from infant brain and muscle libraries and determined its nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence (EMBL/GenBank Accession No. X83218). The encoded polypeptide contains 213 amino acids, with more than 80% identity to bovine and murine ATPase OSCP subunits and over 35% identity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and sweet potato sequences. The human ATP5O gene is located at 21q22.1-q22.2, just proximal to D21S17, in YACs 860G11 and 838C7 of the Chumakov et al. (Nature 359:380, 1992) YAC contig. The gene is expressed in all human tissues examined, most strongly in muscle and heart. This ATP5O subunit is a key structural component of the stalk of the mitochondrial respiratory chain F1F0-ATP synthase and as such may contribute in a gene dosage-dependent manner to the phenotype of Down syndrome (trisomy 21).

Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3 UTR of the gene DMPK at the DM1 locus on chromosome 19 causes myotonic dystrophy, a dominantly inherited disease characterized by skeletal muscle dystrophy and myotonia, cataracts and cardiac conduction defects. Targeted deletion of Dm15, the mouse orthologue of human DMPK, produced mice with a mild myopathy and cardiac conduction abnormalities, but without other features of myotonic dystrophy, such as myotonia and cataracts. We, and others, have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of the adjacent gene SIX5 (refs 7, 8), which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor. To determine whether SIX5 deficiency contributes to the myotonic dystrophy phenotype, we disrupted mouse Six5 by replacing the first exon with a beta-galactosidase reporter. Six5-mutant mice showed reporter expression in multiple tissues, including the developing lens. Homozygous mutant mice had no apparent abnormalities of skeletal muscle function, but developed lenticular opacities at a higher rate than controls. Our results suggest that SIX5 deficiency contributes to the cataract phenotype in myotonic dystrophy, and that myotonic dystrophy represents a multigenic disorder..
Experimental and clinical evidence points to a role of central histaminergic system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The present study was designed to study the effect of histamine H(3)-receptor ligands on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, apomorphine-induced climbing behavior and amphetamine-induced locomotor activities in mice. Catalepsy was induced by haloperidol (2 mg/kg p.o.), while apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg s.c.) and amphetamine (2 mg/kg s.c.) were used for studying climbing behavior and locomotor activities, respectively. (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (RAMH) (5 microg i.c.v.) and thioperamide (THP) (15 mg/kg i.p.), per se did not cause catalepsy. Administration of THP (3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h prior to haloperidol resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the catalepsy times (P < 0.05). However, pretreatment with RAMH significantly reversed such an effect of THP (15 mg/kg i.p.). RAMH per se showed significant reduction in locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed but THP (15 mg/kg i.p.) per se had no effect on these parameters. On amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, THP (3.75 and 7.5 mg/kg i.p.) reduced locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with RAMH (5 microg i.c.v.) could partially reverse such effects of THP (3.75 mg/kg i.p.). Climbing behavior induced by apomorphine was reduced in animals treated with THP. Such an effect was, however, reversed in presence of RAMH. THP exhibited an antipsychotic-like profile by potentiating haloperidol-induced catalepsy, reducing amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and reducing apomorphine-induced climbing in mice. Such effects of THP were reversed by RAMH indicating the involvement of histamine H(3)-receptors. Findings suggest a potential for H(3)-receptor antagonists in improving the refractory cases of schizophrenia.

Experiments in mice tested previous evidence that activation of cholinergic systems promotes catalepsy and that cholinergic mechanisms need to be intact for full expression of neuroleptic-induced catalepsy. Large doses of the cholinomimetic, pilocarpine, could induce catalepsy when peripheral cholinergic receptors were blocked. Low doses of pilocarpine caused a pronounced enhancement of the catalepsy that was induced by the dopaminergic blocker, haloperidol. A muscarinic receptor blocker, atropine, disrupted haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Intracranial injection of an acetylcholine-synthesis inhibitor, hemicholinium, prevented the catalepsy that is usually induced by haloperidol. These findings suggest the hypothesis that the catalepsy that is produced by neuroleptics such as haloperidol is actually mediated by intrinsic central cholinergic systems. Alternatively, activation of central cholinergic systems could promote catalepsy by suppression of dopaminergic systems.
Explicit episodic memory for sensory-discriminative components of capsaicin-induced pain: immediate and delayed ratings.
Exposure to solar radiation, particularly its ultraviolet (UV) B component, has a variety of harmful effects on human health. Some of these effects include sunburn cell formation, basal and squamous cell cancers, melanoma, cataracts, photoaging of the skin, and immune suppression. Amongst these various adverse effects of UV radiation, skin cancer is of the greatest concern. Over the years, changes in lifestyle has led to a significant increase in the amount of UV radiation that people receive, and this consequently has led to a surge in the incidence of skin cancer. The development of skin cancer is a complex multistage phenomenon involving three distinct stages exemplified by initiation, promotion and progression stages. Each of these stages is mediated via alterations in various cellular, biochemical, and molecular changes. Initiation, the first step in the carcinogenesis process is essentially an irreversible step in which genetic alterations occur in genes that ultimately leads to DNA modification and fixation of mutation. Tumor promotion is the essential process in cancer development involving clonal expansion of initiated cells giving rise to pre-malignant and then to malignant lesions, essentially by alterations in signal transduction pathways. Tumor progression involves the conversion of pre-malignant and malignant lesions into an invasive and potentially metastatic malignant tumor. All these processes for skin cancer development involve stimulation of DNA synthesis, DNA damage and proliferation, inflammation, immunosuppression, epidermal hyperplasia, cell cycle dysregulation, depletion of antioxidant defenses, impairment of signal transduction pathways, induction of cyclooxygenase, increase in prostaglandin synthesis, and induction of ornithine decarboxylase. Photochemoprevention has been appreciated as a viable approach to reduce the occurrence of skin cancer and in recent years, the use of agents, especially botanical antioxidants, present in the common diet and beverages consumed by human population have gained considerable attention as photochemopreventive agents for human use. Many such agents have also found a place in skin care products. Although this is more common in oriental countries, its popularity is significantly growing in western countries. In this article, we have summarized the available information of laboratory studies on UVB-mediated signaling that can be exploited as targets for photochemoprevention. We suggest that the use of skin care products supplemented with proven chemopreventive agents in conjunction with the use of sunscreens along with educational efforts may be an effective strategy for reducing UV-induced photodamage and skin cancer in humans. The mechanistic basis for the use of such products is discussed.

Expression in dendritic cells (DCs) of DC-SIGN, a type II membrane protein with a C-type lectin ectodomain, is thought to play an important role in establishing the initial contact between DCs and resting T cells. DC-SIGN is also a unique type of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) attachment factor and promotes efficient infection in trans of cells that express CD4 and chemokine receptors. We have identified another gene, designated here as DC-SIGN2, that exhibits high sequence homology with DC-SIGN. Here we demonstrate that alternative splicing of DC-SIGN1 (original version) and DC-SIGN2 pre-mRNA generates a large repertoire of DC-SIGN-like transcripts that are predicted to encode membrane-associated and soluble isoforms. The range of DC-SIGN1 mRNA expression was significantly broader than previously reported and included THP-1 monocytic cells, placenta, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and there was cell maturation/activation-induced differences in mRNA expression levels. Immunostaining of term placenta with a DC-SIGN1-specific antiserum showed that DC-SIGN1 is expressed on endothelial cells and CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)-positive macrophage-like cells in the villi. DC-SIGN2 mRNA expression was high in the placenta and not detectable in PBMCs. In DCs, the expression of DC-SIGN2 transcripts was significantly lower than that of DC-SIGN1. Notably, there was significant inter-individual heterogeneity in the repertoire of DC-SIGN1 and DC-SIGN2 transcripts expressed. The genes for DC-SIGN1, DC-SIGN2, and CD23, another Type II lectin, colocalize to an approximately 85 kilobase pair region on chromosome 19p13.3, forming a cluster of related genes that undergo highly complex alternative splicing events. The molecular diversity of DC-SIGN-1 and -2 is reminiscent of that observed for certain other adhesive cell surface proteins involved in cell-cell connectivity. The generation of this large collection of polymorphic cell surface and soluble variants that exhibit inter-individual variation in expression levels has important implications for the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, as well as for the molecular code required to establish complex interactions between antigen-presenting cells and T cells, i.e. the immunological synapse.

Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) were reported to affect DNA integrity in human cells with evidence based on the Comet assay. These findings were heavily debated for two main reasons; the lack of reproducibility, and the absence of a plausible scientific rationale for how EMFs could damage DNA. Starting out from a replication of the relevant experiments, we performed this study to clarify the existence and explore origin and nature of ELF-EMF induced DNA effects. Our data confirm that intermittent (but not continuous) exposure of human primary fibroblasts to a 50 Hz EMF at a flux density of 1 mT induces a slight but significant increase of DNA fragmentation in the Comet assay, and we provide first evidence for this to be caused by the magnetic rather than the electric field. Moreover, we show that EMF-induced responses in the Comet assay are dependent on cell proliferation, suggesting that processes of DNA replication rather than the DNA itself may be affected. Consistently, the Comet effects correlated with a reduction of actively replicating cells and a concomitant increase of apoptotic cells in exposed cultures, whereas a combined Fpg-Comet test failed to produce evidence for a notable contribution of oxidative DNA base damage. Hence, ELF-EMF induced effects in the Comet assay are reproducible under specific conditions and can be explained by minor disturbances in S-phase processes and occasional triggering of apoptosis rather than by the generation of DNA damage.
Eye movement abnormalities correlate with genotype in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I.
F-box proteins are an expanding family of eukaryotic proteins characterized by an approximately 40 aminoacid motif, the F box (so named because cyclin F was one of the first proteins in which this motif was identified) . Some F-box proteins have been shown to be critical for the controlled degradation of cellular regulatory proteins . In fact, F-box proteins are one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligases called SCFs. The other three subunits are the Skp1 protein; one of the cullin proteins (Cul1 in metazoans and Cdc53 or Cul A in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae); and the recently identified Roc1 protein (also called Rbx1 or Hrt1). SCF ligases bring ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (either Ubc3 or Ubc4) to substrates that are specifically recruited by the different F-box proteins. The need for high substrate specificity and the large number of known F-box proteins in yeast and worms suggest the existence of a large family of mammalian F-box proteins. Using Skp1 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen and by searching DNA databases, we identified a family of 26 human F-box proteins, 25 of which were novel. Some of these proteins contained WD-40 domains or leucine-rich repeats; others contained either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. We have named the F-box proteins that contain WD-40 domains Fbws, those containing leucine-rich repeats, Fbls, and the remaining ones Fbxs. We have further characterized representative members of these three classes of F-box proteins.
FANCE: the link between Fanconi anaemia complex assembly and activity.
FENS-1 and DFCP1 are FYVE domain-containing proteins with distinct functions in the endosomal and Golgi compartments.
FENS-1 and DFCP1 are recently discovered proteins containing one or two FYVE-domains respectively. We show that the FYVE domains in these proteins can bind PtdIns3P in vitro with high specificity over other phosphoinositides. Exogenously expressed FENS-1 localises to early endosomes: this localisation requires an intact FYVE domain and is sensitive to wortmannin inhibition. The isolated FYVE domain of FENS-1 also localises to endosomes. These results are consistent with current models of FYVE-domain function in this cellular compartment. By contrast, exogenously expressed DFCP1 displays a predominantly Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and vesicular distribution with little or no overlap with FENS-1 or other endosomal markers. Overexpression of DFCP1 was found to cause dispersal of the Golgi compartment defined by giantin and gpp130-staining. Disruption of the FYVE domains of DFCP1 causes a shift to more condensed and compact Golgi structures and overexpression of this mutant was found to confer significant protection to the Golgi against brefeldin-induced dispersal. These properties of DFCP1 are surprising, and suggest FYVE domain-localisation and function may not be exclusively endosomal. Movies available on-line

Fabry disease (FD) (angiokeratoma corporis diffusum) is an X-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by defects in the lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A gene (GLA). The enzymatic defect leads to the systemic accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids with terminal alpha-galactosyl moieties. Clinically, affected hemizygous males have angiokeratoma, severe acroparesthesia, renal failure, and vasculopathy of the heart and brain. While demonstration of alpha-galactosidase deficiency in leukocytes is diagnostic in affected males, enzymatic detection of female carriers is often inconclusive, due to random X-chromosomal inactivation, underlining the need of molecular investigations for accurate genetic counseling. By use of chemical cleavage of mismatches adapted to fluorescence-based detection systems, we have characterized the mutations underlying alpha-Gal A deficiency in 16 individuals from six unrelated families with FD. The mutational spectrum included five missense mutations (C202W, C223G, N224D, R301Q, and Q327K) and one splice-site mutation [IVS3 G (-1) -- > C]. Studies at the mRNA level showed that the latter led to altered pre-mRNA splicing with consequent alteration of the mRNA translational reading frame and generation of a premature termination codon of translation. By use of this strategy, carrier status was accurately assessed in all seven at-risk females tested, whereas enzymatic dosages failed to diagnose or exclude heterozygosity..
Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked inborn error of metabolism resulting from the deficient activity of alpha-galactosidase A which leads to the widespread deposition of glycosphingolipids in lysosomes, and to ischemic complications involving kidneys, heart and brain. Among neurological symptoms, strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIA) have been reported. A 30-year-old male patient, with FD, was referred to us for evaluation of a sudden episode of dizziness, with disequilibrium, and diplopia, in agreement with the diagnosis of a TIA. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no cerebrovascular involvement but revealed the presence of Chiari type I malformation (CMI). We subsequently performed head MRI in a cohort of 44 consecutive hemizygous male patients and seven heterozygous females affected with FD, and identified three additional cases (two males and one female) of CMI. Whether the association is coincidental or not will need further studies but our data suggest that CMI should be ruled out in all Fabry patients.

Factor X deficiency is a rare haemorrhagic condition, normally inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, in which a variable clinical presentation correlates poorly with laboratory phenotype. The factor X (F10) genes of 14 unrelated individuals with factor X deficiency (12 familial and two sporadic cases) were sequenced yielding a total of 13 novel mutations. Family studies were performed in order to distinguish the contributions of individual mutant F10 alleles to the clinical and laboratory phenotypes. Missense mutations were studied by means of molecular modelling, whereas single basepair substitutions in splice sites and the 5 flanking region were examined by in vitro splicing assay and luciferase reporter gene assay respectively. The deletion allele of a novel hexanucleotide insertion/deletion polymorphism in the F10 gene promoter region was shown by reporter gene assay, to reduce promoter activity by approximately 20%. One family manifesting an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance possessed three clinically affected members who were heterozygous for a splice-site mutation that was predicted to lead to the production of a truncated protein product. A model which accounts for the dominant negative effect of this lesion is presented. Variation in the antigen level of heterozygous relatives of probands was found to be significantly higher between families than within families, consistent with the view that the nature of the F10 lesion (s) segregating in a given family is a prime determinant of the laboratory phenotype. By contrast, no such relationship could be discerned between laboratory phenotype and polymorphism genotype..

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever and neutrophil-mediated serosal inflammation. We recently identified the gene causing FMF, designated MEFV, and found it to be expressed in mature neutrophils, suggesting that it functions as an inflammatory regulator. To facilitate our understanding of the normal function of MEFV, we extended our previous studies. MEFV messenger RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow leukocytes, with differential expression observed among cells by in situ hybridization. CD34 hematopoietic stem-cell cultures induced toward the granulocytic lineage expressed MEFV at the myelocyte stage, concurrently with lineage commitment. The prepromyelocytic cell line HL60 expressed MEFV only at granulocytic and monocytic differentiation. MEFV was also expressed in the monocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1. Among peripheral blood leukocytes, MEFV expression was detected in neutrophils, eosinophils, and to varying degrees, monocytes. Consistent with the tissue specificity of expression, complete sequencing and analysis of upstream regulatory regions of MEFV revealed homology to myeloid-specific promoters and to more broadly expressed inflammatory promoter elements. In vitro stimulation of monocytes with the proinflammatory agents interferon (IFN) gamma, tumor necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharide induced MEFV expression, whereas the antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor beta inhibited such expression. Induction by IFN-gamma occurred rapidly and was resistant to cycloheximide. IFN-alpha also induced MEFV expression. In granulocytes, MEFV was up-regulated by IFN-gamma and the combination of IFN-alpha and colchicine. These results refine understanding of MEFV by placing the gene in the myelomonocytic-specific proinflammatory pathway and identifying it as an IFN-gamma immediate early gene..
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever with serositis or synovitis. Recently the FMF gene (MEFV) was cloned; the protein product, pyrin/marenostrin, is thought to regulate inflammation in myeloid cells. In this manuscript we report the mouse and rat homologs of MEFV. The murine gene contains ten exons with a coding sequence of 2304 bp, while the rat homolog has nine exons with a coding sequence of 2253 bp. A considerable amino acid sequence homology was observed between the mouse and human (47. 6% identity and 65. 5% similarity) and between the mouse and rat genes (73. 5% identity and 82. 1% similarity). The predicted rodent proteins have several important domains and signals found in human pyrin, including a B-box zinc finger domain, Robbins-Dingwall nuclear localization signal, and coiled-coil domain. However, perhaps because of an ancient frame-shift mutation, neither the mouse nor the rat protein has an intact C-terminal B30. 2 domain, in which most FMF-associated mutations have been found in human MEFV. Nevertheless, like the human gene, mouse Mefv is expressed in peripheral blood granulocytes but not lymphocytes. Consistent with its expression in granulocytes, Mefv was detected at high levels in the primary follicles and marginal zones of the splenic white pulp. Mefv is localized on mouse Chromosome (Chr) 16, region A3-B1, extending a region of synteny with human Chr 16p13. 3. Development of knockout and knockin mouse models may provide further insights into the functional evolution of this gene.
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever with serositis or synovitis. The FMF gene (MEFV) was cloned recently, and four missense mutations were identified. Here we present data from non-Ashkenazi Jewish and Arab patients in whom we had not originally found mutations and from a new, more ethnically diverse panel. Among 90 symptomatic mutation-positive individuals, 11 mutations accounted for 79% of carrier chromosomes. Of the two mutations that are novel, one alters the same residue (680) as a previously known mutation, and the other (P369S) is located in exon 3. Consistent with another recent report, the E148Q mutation was observed in patients of several ethnicities and on multiple microsatellite haplotypes, but haplotype data indicate an ancestral relationships between non-Jewish Italian and Ashkenazi Jewish patients with FMF and other affected populations. Among approximately 200 anonymous Ashkenazi Jewish DNA samples, the MEFV carrier frequency was 21%, with E148Q the most common mutation. Several lines of evidence indicate reduced penetrance among Ashkenazi Jews, especially for E148Q, P369S, and K695R. Nevertheless, E148Q helps account for recessive inheritance in an Ashkenazi family previously reported as an unusual case of dominantly inherited FMF. The presence of three frequent MEFV mutations in multiple Mediterranean populations strongly suggests a heterozygote advantage in this geographic region.
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessively inherited disorder that is common in patients of Armenian ancestry. To date, its diagnosis, which can be made only retrospectively, is one of exclusion, based entirely on nonspecific clinical signs that result from serosal inflammation and that may lead to unnecessary surgery. Renal amyloidosis, prevented by colchicine, is the most severe complication of FMF, a disorder associated with mutations in the MEFV gene. To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV-gene analysis, we investigated 90 Armenian FMF patients from 77 unrelated families that were not selected through genetic-linkage analysis. Eight mutations, one of which (R408Q) is new, were found to account for 93% of the 163 independent FMF alleles, with both FMF alleles identified in 89% of the patients. In several instances, family studies provided molecular evidence for pseudodominant transmission and incomplete penetrance of the disease phenotype. The M694V homozygous genotype was found to be associated with a higher prevalence of renal amyloidosis and arthritis, compared with other genotypes (P =. 0002 and P =. 006, respectively). The demonstration of both the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV analysis and particular modes of inheritance should lead to new ways for management of FMF-including genetic counseling and therapeutic decisions in affected families.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a dominantly inherited condition predisposing to colorectal cancer. The recent isolation of the responsible gene (adenomatous polyposis coli or APC) has facilitated the search for germ line mutations in affected individuals. Previous authors have used the RNase protection assay and the single-strand conformation polymorphisms procedure to screen for mutations. In this study we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE analysis of 10 APC exons (4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and part of 15) in 33 unrelated Dutch FAP patients has led to the identification of eight novel germ line mutations resulting in stop codons or frameshifts. The results reported here indicate that (1) familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of point mutations; (2) all the mutations found in this study are chain terminating; and (3) DGGE represents a rapid and sensitive technique for the detection of mutations in the unusually large APC gene. An extension of the DGGE analysis to the entire coding region in a sufficient number of clinically well-characterized, unrelated patients will facilitate the establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations. On the other hand, the occurrence of an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of mutations spread throughout the entire length of the large APC gene among the FAP patients indicates that this approach may not be useful as a rapid presymptomatic diagnostic procedure in a routine laboratory. Nevertheless, the above DGGE approach has incidentally led to the identification of a common polymorphism in exon 13. Such intragenic polymorphisms offer a practical approach to a more rapid procedure for presymptomatic diagnosis of FAP by linkage analysis in informative families..
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps predominantly in the colorectal region. Germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are responsible for most cases of FAP. Mutations at the 5 end of APC are known to be associated with a relatively mild form of the disease, called attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC). We identified a frameshift mutation in the 3 part of exon 15, resulting in a stop codon at 1862, in a large Dutch kindred with AAPC. Western blot analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from affected family members from this kindred, as well as from a previously reported Swiss family carrying a frameshift mutation at codon 1987 and displaying a similar attenuated phenotype, showed only the wild-type APC protein. Our study indicates that chain-terminating mutations located in the 3 part of APC do not result in detectable truncated polypeptides and we hypothesize that this is likely to be the basis for the observed AAPC phenotype..

Familial expansile osteolysis (FEO, MIM 174810) is a rare, autosomal dominant bone disorder characterized by focal areas of increased bone remodelling. The osteolytic lesions, which develop usually in the long bones during early adulthood, show increased osteoblast and osteoclast activity. Our previous linkage studies mapped the gene responsible for FEO to an interval of less than 5 cM between D18S64 and D18S51 on chromosome 18q21. 2-21 2-21. 3 in a large Northern Irish family. The gene encoding receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANK; ref. 5), TNFRSF11A, maps to this region. RANK is essential in osteoclast formation. We identified two heterozygous insertion mutations in exon 1 of TNFRSF11A in affected members of four families with FEO or familial Paget disease of bone (PDB). One was a duplication of 18 bases and the other a duplication of 27 bases, both of which affected the signal peptide region of the RANK molecule. Expression of recombinant forms of the mutant RANK proteins revealed perturbations in expression levels and lack of normal cleavage of the signal peptide. Both mutations caused an increase in RANK-mediated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signalling in vitro, consistent with the presence of an activating mutation.
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common form of autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia, and is caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Heterozygous FH is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and early-onset cardiovascular disease, whereas homozygous FH results in more severe LDL cholesterol elevation with death by 20 years of age. We present here the case of an African-American female FH patient presenting with a myocardial infarction at the age of 48, recurrent angina pectoris and numerous coronary artery stents. Her pretreated LDL cholesterol levels were more typical of a homozygous FH pattern and she was resistant to conventional lipid-lowering treatment, yet her other clinical parameters were not necessarily consistent with homozygous FH. Genetic testing revealed two LDLR variants on the same chromosome: one a novel missense mutation in exon 14 (Cys681Gly) and the other a promoter variant (IVS1-217C>T) previously shown to result in increased LDLR transcription. Disease-associated PCSK9 or APOB mutations were not identified in this individual. Overall, her genetic and clinical profile suggests that enhanced expression of the mutant LDLR allele resulted in a severe phenotype with characteristics of both heterozygous and homozygous FH.
Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal codominant disorder resulting in a dramatic reduction in plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein (apo) B, cholesterol, and beta-migrating lipoproteins. A benefit of hypobetalipoproteinemia is that mildly affected individuals may be protected from coronary vascular disease. We have used gene targeting to generate mice with a modified Apob allele. Mice containing this allele display all of the hallmarks of human hypobetalipoproteinemia they produce a truncated apoB protein, apoB70, and have markedly decreased plasma concentrations of apoB, beta-lipoproteins, and total cholesterol. In addition, the mice manifest several characteristics that are occasionally observed in human hypobetalipoproteinemia, including reduced plasma triglyceride concentrations, fasting chylomicronemia, and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol. An unexpected finding is that the modified Apob allele is strongly associated with exencephalus and hydrocephalus. These mice should help increase our understanding of hypobetalipoproteinemia, atherogenesis, and the etiology of exencephalus and hydrocephalus..
Familial male breast cancer is not linked to the BRCA1 locus on chromosome 17q.
Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by deficiency in the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) encoded by the AVP-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene on chromosome 20p13. In this study, we analyzed two families with FNDI using direct automated fluorescent, solid phase, single-stranded DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified AVP-NPII DNA. In one of the families, affected individuals presented a novel nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the gene, consisting in a G to T transition at nucleotide 2101, which produces a stop signal in codon 82 (Glu) of NPII. The premature termination eliminates part of the C-terminal domain of NPII, including a cysteine residue in position 85, which could be involved in the correct folding of the prohormone. In the second family, a G279A substitution at position -1 of the signal peptide was observed in all affected individuals. This missense mutation, which replaces Ala with Thr, is frequent among FNDI patients and is thought to reduce the efficiency of cleavage by signal peptidases..
Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is an inherited deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In the present study we have analyzed the AVP-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene in a Spanish kindred. Studies were performed on seven members (four clinically affected) of the family. Patients were diagnosed at the Hospital Universitario Gregorio Maranon (Madrid, Spain). The entire coding region of the AVP-NPII gene of all family members was amplified by PCR and sequenced. All affected individuals presented a missense mutation (G1757-- > A) that replaces glycine at position 23 with arginine within the NPII domain. The substitution was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and was present in heterozygosis. Additionally, one of the asymptomatic relatives (a girl 8 months old at the time of study) was identified as carrier of the same mutation and developed the disease 3 months later. The alteration found in the second exon of the gene in this family seems to be responsible for the disease, as all individuals harboring the mutation had been previously diagnosed or have eventually developed FNDI. Identification of the molecular defect underlying FNDI in affected families is a powerful tool for early asymptomatic diagnosis in infants..
Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by post-natal development of arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency due to mutations in the AVP gene. All published mutations affect the signal peptide or the neurophysin-II carrier protein and are presumed to interfere with processing of the preprohormone, leading to neuronal damage. We studied an unusual Palestinian family consisting of asymptomatic first cousin parents and three children affected with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. All three affected children were homozygous and the parents heterozygous for a single novel mutation (C301- > T) in exon 1, replacing Pro7 of mature AVP with Leu (Leu-AVP). Leu-AVP was a weak agonist with approximately 30-fold reduced binding to the human V2 receptor. Measured by radioimmunoassay with a synthetic Leu-AVP standard, serum Leu-AVP levels were elevated in all three children and further increased during water deprivation to as high as 30 times normal. The youngest child (2 years old) was only mildly affected but had Leu-AVP levels similar to her severely affected 8-year-old brother, suggesting that unknown mechanisms may partially compensate for a deficiency of active AVP in very young children..

Famotidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist used in inpatient settings for prevention of stress ulcers and is showing increasing popularity because of its low cost. Although all of the currently available H2-receptor antagonists have shown the propensity to cause delirium, only two previously reported cases have been associated with famotidine. The authors report on six cases of famotidine-associated delirium in hospitalized patients who cleared completely upon removal of famotidine. The pharmacokinetics of famotidine are reviewed, with no change in its metabolism in the elderly population seen. The implications of using famotidine in elderly persons are discussed.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosomal instability syndrome associated with a strong predisposition to cancer, particularly acute myeloid leukemia and squamous cell carcinoma. At the cellular level, FA is characterized by spontaneous chromosomal breakage and a unique hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents. Complementation analysis has indicated that at least seven distinct genes are involved in the pathogenesis of FA. Despite the identification of four of these genes (FANCA, FANCC, FANCF and FANCG), the nature of the 'FA pathway' has remained enigmatic, as the FA proteins lack sequence homologies or motifs that could point to a molecular function. To further define this pathway, we studied the subcellular localizations and mutual interactions of the FA proteins, including the recently identified FANCF protein, in human lymphoblasts. FANCF was found predominantly in the nucleus, where it complexes with FANCA, FANCC and FANCG. These interactions were detected in wild-type and FA-D lymphoblasts, but not in lymphoblasts of other FA complementation groups. This implies that each of the FA proteins, except FANCD, is required for these complexes to form. Similarly, we show that the interaction between FANCA and FANCC is restricted to wild-type and FA-D cells. Furthermore, we document the subcellular localization of FANCA and the FANCA/FANCG complex in all FA complementation groups. Our results, along with published data, culminate in a model in which a multi-protein FA complex serves a nuclear function to maintain genomic integrity.
Fas antigen, also termed APO-1 or CD95, is a transmembrane protein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily which mediates apoptosis upon oligomerization. The Fas/Fas ligand system is considered to be a key regulator of apoptosis. Recently, we have demonstrated that Fas antigen expression is induced by low-dose irradiation of some types of lymphomas, and we also demonstrated that irradiation-induced Fas antigen expression increased with the passage of time until peaking at 48 h after irradiation in CML-C1, CML-C2, DL-40, and DL-95 cell lines. In this study, we also examined the potential cytotoxicity of Fas ligand peptide against several types of lymphoma/leukemia cell lines that showed induction of Fas antigen expression under irradiation. Flow cytometry analysis was performed at 6, 24 and 48 h after irradiation. Samples (1 x10(6) cells/ml) from irradiated and non-irradiated cells of each cell line were incubated with or without 5 microg/ml of Fas ligand peptide for 2 h at 37 degrees C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) in air. The killing effect of Fas ligand against cell lines of CML-C1, DL-40, and DL-95 were clearly identified as the percentage of cells with Fas antigen expression induced by irradiation. Concerning HD-70 cell line, for which soluble Fas antigen has been identified, the killing effects were clearly observed in samples pre-treated with PBS washings. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a possible application of the Fas/Fas ligand system in treatment of certain types of malignancies in which Fas antigen is inducible by irradiation.

Fibrin sealant (FS), a biological adhesive material, has been recently recommended as an adjunct in autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). While FS has been shown to possess osteoinductive potential, little is known about its effects on chondrogenic cells. In this study, we assessed the bioactivity of FS (Tisseel) on the migration and proliferation of human articular chondrocytes in vitro. Using a co-culture assay to mimic matrix-induced ACI (MACI), chondrocytes were found to migrate from collagen membranes towards FS within 12 h of culture, with significant migratory activity evident by 24 h. In addition, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation experiments revealed that thrombin, the active component of the tissue glue, stimulated chondrocyte proliferation, with maximal efficacy observed at 48 h post-stimulation (1-10 U/ml). In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these thrombin-induced effects, we examined the expression and activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs), established thrombin receptors. Using a combination of RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, all four PARs were detected in human chondrocytes, with PAR-1 being the major isoform expressed. Moreover, thrombin and a PAR-1, but not other PAR-isotype-specific peptide agonists, were found to induce rapid intracellular Ca2+ responses in human chondrocytes in calcium mobilization assays. Together, these data demonstrate that FS supports both the migration and proliferation of human chondrocytes. We propose that these effects are mediated, at least in part, via thrombin-induced PAR-1 signalling in human chondrocytes.
Fibrin sealant promotes migration and proliferation of human articular chondrocytes: possible involvement of thrombin and protease-activated receptors.
Fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 2 (FHF2): gene structure, expression and mapping to the Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome region in Xq26 delineated by a duplication breakpoint in a BFLS-like patient.
Fibrous myopathy is a common, well-known side effect of repeated pentazocine injection. However, compression neuropathy due to fibrotic muscle affected by pentazocine-induced myopathy has not previously been reported. In a 37-year-old woman with documented pentazocine-induced fibrous myopathy of triceps and deltoid muscles bilaterally and a three-week history of right wrist drop, electrodiagnostic examination showed a severe but partial lesion of the right radial nerve distal to the branches to the triceps, in addition to the fibrous myopathy. Surgery revealed the right radial nerve to be severely compressed by the densely fibrotic lateral head of the triceps. Decompression and neurolysis were performed with good subsequent recovery of function.
Fibulin-2 (FBLN2): human cDNA sequence, mRNA expression, and mapping of the gene on human and mouse chromosomes.
Fibulin-2 is a new extracellular matrix protein that we recently identified by characterizing mouse cDNA clones. Fibulin-2 mRNA is prominently expressed in mouse heart tissue and is present in low amounts in other tissues. In this study, we isolated and sequenced a 4.1-kb human fibulin-2 cDNA, which encoded a mature protein of 1157 amino acids preceded by a 27-residue signal sequence. The predicted polypeptide contains three consecutive anaphylatoxin-related segments (domain I) in its central region followed by 10 EGF-like repeats (domain II), 9 of which have a consensus sequence for calcium binding. The 408-residue N-terminal region consists of two separate subdomains, a cysteine-rich segment of 150 residues (Na subdomain) and a cysteine-free segment with a stretch of acidic amino acids (Nb subdomain). The 115-residue C-terminal segment (domain III) is similar to the C variant of fibulin-1. The amino acid sequences of the human and mouse fibulin-2 share approximately 90% identity in domains Na, I, II, and III but only 62% identity in domain Nb. The human cDNA lacks an EGF-like repeat, which is alternatively spliced in the mouse cDNA clones, and a potential cell-binding Arg-Gly-Asp sequence found in the Nb domain of the mouse counterpart. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from various human tissues reveals an abundant 4.5-kb transcript in heart, placenta, and ovary tissue. The expression pattern differs from that of fibulin-1. The fibulin-2 gene was localized by in situ hybridization to the p24-p25 region of human chromosome 3 and to the band D-E of mouse chromosome 6.
Field potential duration (FPD) in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs), which can express QT interval in an electrocardiogram, is reported to be a useful tool to predict K(+) channel and Ca(2+) channel blocker effects on QT interval. However, there is no report showing that this technique can be used to predict multichannel blocker potential for QT prolongation. The aim of this study is to show that FPD from MEA (Multielectrode array) of hiPS-CMs can detect QT prolongation induced by multichannel blockers. hiPS-CMs were seeded onto MEA and FPD was measured for 2min every 10min for 30min after drug exposure for the vehicle and each drug concentration. IKr and IKs blockers concentration-dependently prolonged corrected FPD (FPDc), whereas Ca(2+) channel blockers concentration-dependently shortened FPDc. Also, the multichannel blockers Amiodarone, Paroxetine, Terfenadine and Citalopram prolonged FPDc in a concentration dependent manner. Finally, the IKr blockers, Terfenadine and Citalopram, which are reported to cause Torsade de Pointes (TdP) in clinical practice, produced early afterdepolarization (EAD). hiPS-CMs using MEA system and FPDc can predict the effects of drug candidates on QT interval. This study also shows that this assay can help detect EAD for drugs with TdP potential.
Fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged apnoea lasting several hours after succinylcholine have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholinesterase. Adequate spontaneous respiration was re-established in an average period of ten minutes after the injection. In 12 patients biochemical genetic examinations confirmed the presence of an atypical serum cholinesterase. In three patients none of the usual variants were found. It is therefore supposed that other unknown variants of serum cholinesterase exist which cannot hydrolyze succinylcholine. The use of serum cholinesterase in succinylcholine apnoea provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthetist.
Fifty-four patients, aged 27-90 years, who were given lignocaine 5% in 6.8% glucose solution for spinal anaesthesia were studied. Thirteen of these patients experienced pain in the legs and/or back after recovery from anaesthesia. The patients affected were younger (p < 0.05) and the site of the dural puncture was higher (p < 0.01) than those individuals without pain. Five of the 13 patients (38%) with pain and seven of the 41 patients (17%) without pain admitted to a high alcohol intake, which might be a contributing factor. Leg and/or back pain is associated with the intrathecal use of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine.
Fine mapping and identification of a candidate gene SSH1 in disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis.
Five cases of encephalitis during treatment of loiasis with diethylcarbamazine.
Five cases of encephalitis following treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) were observed in Congolese patients with Loa loa filariasis. Two cases had a fatal outcome and one resulted in severe sequelae. The notable fact was that this complication occurred in three patients hospitalized before treatment began, with whom particularly strict therapeutic precautions were taken, i.e., initial dose less than 10 mg of DEC, very gradual dose increases, and associated anti-allergic treatment. This type of drug-induced complication may not be that uncommon in highly endemic regions. It occurs primarily, but not exclusively, in subjects presenting with a high microfilarial load. The relationship between the occurrence of encephalitis and the decrease in microfilaremia is evident. The pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in the light of these observations and the few other comments on this subject published in the literature.
Five children, aged 3 to 11 years, treated with carbamazepine for epilepsy, had an acute aberrant reaction characterized by the onset of myoclonic, atypical absence and/or atonic (minor motor) seizures within a few days. When the carbamazepine was discontinued, two of the children returned to their former state very quickly, two had the minor motor seizures resolve in 3 and 6 months, and one had the seizures persist. The child in whom the seizures persisted was later found to have ceroid lipofuscinosis. The other children are doing well on other anticonvulsants.
Five clones that hybridized weakly with the human retinoblastoma (Rb) gene were obtained by screening a human genomic library in a non-stringent condition. The DNAs of two of these clones were partially sequenced and found to contain a region with considerable homology to part of the Rb gene. These two clones were found to contain L1 family repeating sequences. This finding is discussed in relation with possible functions of the L1 family. As the L1 family is transposable, the Rb gene may be inactivated by recombination at this homologous region. Another possibility related with the DNA binding properties of Rb and L1 family proteins is also discussed.
Five male Japanese patients with complex glycerol kinase deficiency (CGKD) and their relatives were studied clinically, cytogenetically, and molecular-genetically. All patients had muscular dystrophy or muscle weakness, mental retardation, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, and glycerol kinase deficiency. High-resolution GTG-banded chromosomes showed a microdeletion in the Xp21 region in all four patients examined and in all five mothers. Southern hybridizations, after digestions by restriction endonucleases, with various cloned DNAs (D2, 99-6, B24, C7, L1-4, cDMD13-14, J66-HI, P20, J-Bir, ERT87-30, ERT87-15, ERT87-8, ERT87-1, XJ-1. 1, 754, cx5. 7, and OTC-1) that are located around Xp21 also showed a deletion in the genome of all patients and mothers. Although the deletion differed in size among patients, a segment commonly absent was located between the genomic sequences corresponding to L1-4 and cDMD13-14. This finding indicated that the gene coding for glycerol kinase (GK) is located within this segment. A comparison of the clinical manifestations of the present five patients and reported CGKD or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients with DNA deletion suggests the existence of a certain gene responsible for gonadotropin deficiency (GTD). The result of the present study and results of previous studies suggest that genes for ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), DMD, and GK and putative genes responsible for congenital adrenal hypoplasia (AHC) and GTD are arranged from telomere to centromere as pter--GTD--AHC--GK--DMD--OTC--cen
Five members of a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein (CABP) subfamily with similarity to calmodulin.
Five members of a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein subfamily (CaBP), with 46-58% sequence similarity to calmodulin (CaM), were identified in the vertebrate retina. Important differences between these Ca(2+)-binding proteins and CaM include alterations within their second EF-hand loop that render these motifs inactive in Ca(2+) coordination and the fact that their central alpha-helixes are extended by one alpha-helical turn. CaBP1 and CaBP2 contain a consensus sequence for N-terminal myristoylation, similar to members of the recoverin subfamily and are fatty acid acylated in vitro. The patterns of expression differ for each of the various members. Expression of CaBP5, for example, is restricted to retinal rod and cone bipolar cells. In contrast, CaBP1 has a more widespread pattern of expression. In the brain, CaBP1 is found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and in the retina this protein is found in cone bipolar and amacrine cells. CaBP1 and CaBP2 are expressed as multiple, alternatively spliced variants, and in heterologous expression systems these forms show different patterns of subcellular localization. In reconstitution assays, CaBPs are able to substitute functionally for CaM. These data suggest that these novel CaBPs are an important component of Ca(2+)-mediated cellular signal transduction in the central nervous system where they may augment or substitute for CaM.
Five months after starting nifedipine (Adalat), two patients developed photodistributed facial telangiectasia, which became more noticeable with time. Neither patient complained of photosensitivity or flushing. Both patients reported a significant cosmetic improvement after discontinuing the drug. One commenced the closely related drug amlodipine 3 years later, with recurrence of telangiectasia. The photodistribution of the telangiectasia suggests a significant drug/light interaction.
Five patients receiving fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder or major depression developed akathisia. The typical fluoxetine-induced symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, purposeless movements of the feet and legs, and marked anxiety were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic-induced akathisia in the past reported that the symptoms of fluoxetine-induced akathisia were identical, although somewhat milder. Akathisia appeared to be a common side effect of fluoxetine and generally responded well to treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, dose reduction, or both. The authors suggest that fluoxetine-induced akathisia may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of fluoxetine-induced akathisia and tricyclic antidepressant-induced "jitteriness" may be identical.
Five patients with carcinoma developed thrombotic microangiopathy (characterized by renal insufficiency, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and usually thrombocytopenia) after treatment with cisplatin, bleomycin, and a vinca alkaloid. One patient had thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, three the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and one an apparent forme fruste of one of these disorders. Histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of intravascular coagulation, primarily affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and glomeruli. Because each patient was tumor-free or had only a small tumor at the onset of this syndrome, the thrombotic microangiopathy may have been induced by chemotherapy. Diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined, because renal failure may be ascribed to cisplatin nephrotoxicity and the anemia and thrombocytopenia to drug-induced bone marrow suppression.
Five patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) treated with lamotrigine (LTG) experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of myoclonic jerks (MJ). In three patients, LTG exacerbated MJ in a dose-dependent manner with early aggravation during titration. MJ disappeared when LTG dose was decreased by 25 to 50%. In two patients, LTG exacerbated MJ in a delayed but more severe manner, with myoclonic status that only ceased after LTG withdrawal.
Five patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension who had physiologic and biochemical evidence of severe autonomic dysfunction were included in the study. They all exhibited markedly reduced plasma catecholamines and plasma renin activity in both recumbent and upright positions and had marked hypersensitivity to the pressor effects of infused norepinephrine. Treatment with propanolol administered intravenously (1-5 mg) produced increases in supine and upright blood pressure in 4 of the 5 individuals with rises ranging from 11/6 to 22/11 mmHg. Chronic oral administration of propranolol (40-160 mg/day) also elevated the blood pressures of these individuals with increases in the order of 20-35/15-25 mmg being observed. In 1 patient, marked hypertension was induced by propranolol and the drug had to be withdrawn. It otherwise was well tolerated and no important side effects were observed. Treatment has been continued in 3 individuals for 6-13 months with persistence of the pressor effect, although there appears to have been some decrease in the degree of response with time. Hemodynamic measurements in 1 of the patients demonstrated an increase in total peripheral resistance and essentially no change in cardiac output following propranolol therapy. The studies suggest that propranolol is a useful drug in selected patients with severe idiopathic orthostatic hypotension.
Flestolol (ACC-9089) is a nonselective, competitive, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent, without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Flestolol is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half-life of approximately 6.5 minutes. This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms/kg/min. In long-term infusion studies, flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta-blocking dose (5 micrograms/kg/min) for up to seven days. Flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta-adrenergic blockade. Flestolol produced a dose-dependent attenuation of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of flestolol are similar to those of other beta blockers. In contrast with other beta blockers, flestolol-induced effects reverse rapidly (within 30 minutes) following discontinuation because of its short half-life. Flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. In patients with unstable angina, flestolol infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling chest pain. It is concluded that flestolol is a potent, well-tolerated, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Use of flestolol in the critical care setting is currently undergoing investigation.
Flestolol: an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent.
Flow cytometry and recombinant DNA techniques have been used to obtain reagents for a molecular analysis of the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). HindIII total-digest libraries were prepared in lambda phage Charon 21A from flow-sorted inverted duplicated no. 15 human chromosomes and propagated on recombination-proficient (LE392) and recBC-, sbcB- (DB1257) bacteria. Twelve distinct chromosome 15-specific probes have been isolated. Eight localized to the region 15q11----13. Four of these eight sublocalized to band 15q11. 2 and are shown to be deleted in DNA of one of two patients examined with the PWS. Heteroduplex analysis of two of these clones, which grew on DB1257 but not on LE392, revealed stem-loop structures in the inserts, indicative of inverted, repeated DNA elements. Such DNA repeats might account for some of the cloning instability of DNA segments from proximal 15q. Analysis of the genetic and physical instability associated with the repeated sequences we have isolated from band 15q11. 2 may elucidate the molecular basis for the instability of this chromosomal region in patients with the PWS or other diseases associated with chromosomal abnormalities in the proximal long arm of human chromosome 15

Flumazenil induces seizures and death in mixed cocaine-diazepam intoxications.
Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used to reverse sedation and respiratory depression induced by benzodiazepines. Seizures and cardiac arrhythmias have complicated its use in adult patients. Overdose patients who have coingested tricyclic antidepressants have a higher risk of these complications. Little information exists concerning adverse effects of flumazenil in children. We report the occurrence of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure in a pediatric patient following the administration of flumazenil.
Flunitrazepam 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg was given by the oral or i.m. routes to groups of volunteers and its effects compared. Plasma concentrations of the drug were estimated by gas-liquid chromatography, in a smaller number of the subjects. The most striking effect was sedation which increased with the dose, 2 mg producing deep sleep although the subjects could still be aroused. The effects of i.m. administration were apparent earlier and sometimes lasted longer than those following oral administration. Dizziness was less marked than sedation, but increased with the dose. There was pain on i.m. injection of flunitrazepam significantly more often than with isotonic saline. Plasma concentrations varied with dose and route and corresponded qualitatively with the subjective effects. The drug was still present in measurable quantities after 24 h even with the smallest dose.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with biotin-labeled probes mapping to 11p13 has been used for the molecular analysis of deletions of the WAGR (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) locus. We have detected a submicroscopic 11p13 deletion in a child with inherited aniridia who subsequently presented with Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney, only revealed at surgery. The mother, who has aniridia, was also found to carry a deletion including both the aniridia candidate gene (AN2) and the Wilms tumor predisposition gene (WT1). This is therefore a rare case of an inherited WAGR deletion. Wilms tumor has so far only been associated with sporadic de novo aniridia cases. We have shown that a cosmid probe for a candidate aniridia gene, homologous to the mouse Pax-6 gene, is deleted in cell lines from aniridia patients with previously characterized deletions at 11p13, while another cosmid marker mapping between two aniridia-associated translocation breakpoints (and hence a second candidate marker) is present on both chromosomes. These results support the Pax-6 homologue as a strong candidate for the AN2 gene. FISH with cosmid probes has proved to be a fast and reliable technique for the molecular analysis of deletions. It can be used with limited amounts of material and has strong potential for clinical applications..
Fluoxetine improves the memory deficits caused by the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil.
Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is gaining increased acceptance in the treatment of adolescent depression. Generally safe and well tolerated by adults, fluoxetine has been reported to induce mania. The cases of five depressed adolescents, 14-16 years of age, who developed mania during pharmacotherapy with fluoxetine, are reported here. Apparent risk factors for the development of mania or hypomania during fluoxetine pharmacotherapy in this population were the combination of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and affective instability; major depression with psychotic features; a family history of affective disorder, especially bipolar disorder; and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Further study is needed to determine the optimal dosage and to identify risk factors that increase individual vulnerability to fluoxetine induced mania in adolescents.

Focal cerebral ischemia in rats: effect of phenylephrine-induced hypertension during reperfusion.
Folate depletion has often been a problem in chronic antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. Carbamazepine (CBZ), a commonly used AED, has been implicated in some clinical studies. A rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic CBZ treatment on folate concentrations in the rat. In the course of developing this model, a common vehicle, propylene glycol, by itself in high doses, was found to exhibit protective properties against induced seizures and inhibited weight gain. Seizures induced by hexafluorodiethyl ether (HFDE) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by CBZ than seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES). Oral administration of CBZ as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg/kg was continuously protective against HFDE-induced seizures and was minimally toxic as measured by weight gain over 8 weeks of treatment. The CBZ levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals, however, were below those normally considered protective. This treatment with CBZ had no apparent adverse effect on folate concentrations in the rat, and, indeed, the folate concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment.
Following major intracranial surgery in a 35-year-old man, sodium pentothal was intravenously infused to minimize cerebral ischaemia. Intense vasospasm with threatened gangrene arose in the arm used for the infusion. Since the cranial condition precluded use of more usual methods, lidocaine was given intra-arterially, with careful cardiovascular monitoring, to counteract the vasospasm. The treatment was rapidly successful.
Following status epilepticus in the rat, dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly, and many of the new neurons appear to develop ectopically, in the hilar region of the hippocampal formation. It has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous seizures that ultimately develop after status epilepticus. However, the population has never been quantified, so it is unclear whether it is substantial enough to have a strong influence on epileptogenesis. To quantify this population, the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stereology at different times after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. The number of hilar neurons immunoreactive for Prox-1, a granule-cell-specific marker, was estimated using the optical fractionator method. The results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after status epilepticus is substantial, and stable over time. Interestingly, the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral seizures, because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hilus have more frequent behavioral seizures. The hilar ectopic granule cell population does not appear to vary systematically across the septotemporal axis, although it is associated with an increase in volume of the hilus. The results provide new insight into the potential role of ectopic hilar granule cells in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.
Following the birth of two infants with Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), a non-Jewish, Pennsylvania Dutch kindred was screened for TSD carriers using the biochemical assay. A high frequency of individuals who appeared to be TSD heterozygotes was detected (Kelly et al., 1975). Clinical and biochemical evidence suggested that the increased carrier frequency was due to at least two altered alleles for the hexosaminidase A alpha-subunit. We now report two mutant alleles in this Pennsylvania Dutch kindred, and one polymorphism. One allele, reported originally in a French TSD patient (Akli et al., 1991), is a GT-- > AT transition at the donor splice-site of intron 9. The second, a C-- > T transition at nucleotide 739 (Arg247Trp), has been shown by Triggs-Raine et al. (1992) to be a clinically benign " pseudodeficient " allele associated with reduced enzyme activity against artificial substrate. Finally, a polymorphism [G-- > A (759)], which leaves valine at codon 253 unchanged, is described .
Following unilateral 6-OHDA induced SN lesion, a transient period of contralateral rotation has been reported to precede the predominant ipsilateral circling. In order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion, on amphetamine-induced rotational behavior. Three days post lesion, most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion. Such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration-induced breakdown of the DA pool, or lesion-induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons. A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral rotation. However, regardless of the duration of recovery (and irrespective of either lesion volume, amphetamine dose, or post-lesion motor exercise), amphetamine-induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections. These findings suggest that amphetamine has an irreversible effect on the post-lesion DA pool contributing to contralateral rotation.
For genetic counseling and predictive testing in families with inherited breast-ovarian cancer, penetrances and expressions of the underlying mutations should be known. We have previously reported two BRCA1 founder mutations in the Norwegian population. Index cases for the present study were found two different ways through a series of consecutive ovarian cancers (n = 16) and through our family cancer clinic (n = 14). Altogether, 20 of the patients had BRCA1 1675delA, and 10 had 1135insA. Their relatives were described with respect to absence/presence of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Of 133 living female relatives, 83 (62%) were tested for the presence of a mutation. No difference, in penetrance and expression, between the two mutations were found, whereas differences according to method of ascertainment were seen. The overall findings were that disease started to occur at age 30 years and that by age 50 years 48% of the mutation-carrying women had experienced breast and/or ovarian cancer. More ovarian cancers than breast cancers were recorded. Both penetrance and expression (breast cancer vs. ovarian cancer) were different from those in reports of the Ashkenazi founder mutations. Whether the reported differences reflect true differences and/or methodological problems is discussed. An observed excess of mutation carriers could not be accounted for by methodological problems; possible explanations were a " true " low penetrance or preferential segregation..
For previously treated advanced breast cancer, there is no standard second-line therapy. Combination chemotherapy with mitoxantrone, high-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (MFL regimen) had been reported as an effective and well tolerated regimen. From October 1993 to November 1995, we treated 13 patients with previously chemotherapy-treated metastatic breast cancer by mitoxantrone, 12 mg/m2, on day 1 and continuous infusion of 5-FU, 3000 mg/m2, together with leucovorin, 300 mg/m2, for 48 h from day 1 to 2. Each course of chemotherapy was given every 4 weeks. Most of these patients had more than two metastatic sites, with lung metastasis predominant. Seven patients had been treated with anthracycline. Seven patients had previously received radiotherapy and seven had received hormone therapy. Median number of courses of MFL regimen given was six and the median cumulative dose of mitoxantrone was 68.35 mg/m2. One patient had complete response, seven had stable disease, none had partial response and five had progressive disease. The overall objective response rate was 7.6%. The median follow-up period was 14 months. Median survival was 16 months. Median progression-free survival was 5 months. A complete responder had relapse-free survival up to 17 months. Major toxicities were cardiotoxicity and leukopenia. Eight patients were dead in the last follow-up; two of them died of treatment-related toxicity. The MFL regimen achieves little palliative benefit and induces severe toxicity at a fairly high rate. Administration of this regimen to breast cancer patients who have been treated by chemotherapy and those with impaired heart function requires careful attention.
For sumatriptan, tightness in the chest caused by an unknown mechanism has been reported in 3-5% of users. We describe a 47-year-old woman with an acute myocardial infarction after administration of sumatriptan 6 mg subcutaneously for cluster headache. The patient had no history of underlying ischaemic heart disease or Prinzmetal's angina. She recovered without complications.
Force overflow and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.
Formation of coronary aneurysm is a rare complication of stenting with bare metal stents, but based on experimental studies drug-eluting stents may induce toxic effects on the vessel wall with incomplete stent apposition, aneurysm formation and with the potential of stent thrombosis or vessel rupture. We present a 43-year-old man who developed a coronary aneurysm in the right coronary artery 6 months after receiving a paclitaxel-eluting stent. The patient was asymptomatic and the aneurysm was detected in a routine control. Angiography and intracoronary ultrasound demonstrated lack of contact between stent and vessel wall in a 15-mm long segment with maximal aneurysm diameter of 6.0 mm. The patient was successfully treated with a graft stent.
Forty minutes after receiving a single starting dose of trazodone, a patient developed complete heart block. The case illustrates that, despite the results of earlier studies, trazodone's effect on cardiac conduction may be severe in individuals at risk for conduction delay.
Forty patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma treated with vincristine between 1984 and 1990 (cumulative dose 12 mg in 18-24 weeks) were investigated in order to evaluate the long term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system. The patients were interviewed with emphasis on neuropathic symptoms. Physical and quantitative sensory examination with determination of vibratory perception and thermal discrimination thresholds were performed, four to 77 months (median 34 months) after vincristine treatment. Twenty-seven patients reported neuropathic symptoms. In 13 of these 27 patients symptoms were still present at the time of examination. In these patients sensory signs and symptoms predominated. In the other 14 patients symptoms had been present in the past. Symptoms persisted maximally 40 months since cessation of therapy. There was no age difference between patients with and without complaints at the time of examination. Normal reflexes were found in two third of patients. Neuropathic complaints were not very troublesome on the long term. It is concluded that with the above mentioned vincristine dose schedule signs and symptoms of vincristine neuropathy are reversible for a great deal and prognosis is fairly good.

Four cases of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and one case of adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) have developed in a kindred over three generations demonstrating that AMN is a clinical variant of ALD. Pituitary-adrenal function studies were performed in 10 family members, including two affected males and four females identified as carriers of ALD/AMN. No pituitary-adrenal abnormality was found in the carriers. However, basal morning plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels were markedly elevated in the two males with ALD and AMN, despite the fact that they had no clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency and that morning plasma cortisol levels and their response to maximal exogenous ACTH stimulation appeared to be normal. In addition, the integrated 24-hour response to the administration were also subnormal in these two cases. Thus, people with ALD and AMN may have subclinical partial adrenocrotical insufficiency. No other endocrinologic dysfunction was identified..
Four cases of water intoxication in connection with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortions are described. The mechanism of water intoxication is discussed in regard to these cases. Oxytocin administration during midtrimester-induced abortions is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff, aware of the symptoms of water intoxication and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as asthenia, muscular irritability, or headaches. The oxytocin should be given only in Ringers lactate or, alternately, in Ringers lactate and a 5 per cent dextrose and water solutions. The urinary output should be monitored and the oxytocin administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases. The oxytocin should not be administered in excess of 36 hours. If the patient has not aborted by then the oxytocin should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance.
Four hundred two patients with suspected myocardial infarction seen within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms entered a double-blind randomized trial of lidocaine vs placebo. During the 1 hour after administration of the drug the incidence of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia among the 204 patients with acute myocardial infarction was low, 1.5%. Lidocaine, given in a 300 mg dose intramuscularly followed by 100 mg intravenously, did not prevent sustained ventricular tachycardia, although there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with warning arrhythmias between 15 and 45 minutes after the administration of lidocaine (p less than 0.05). The average plasma lidocaine level 10 minutes after administration for patients without a myocardial infarction was significantly higher than that for patients with an acute infarction. The mean plasma lidocaine level of patients on beta-blocking agents was no different from that in patients not on beta blocking agents. During the 1-hour study period, the incidence of central nervous system side effects was significantly greater in the lidocaine group, hypotension occurred in 11 patients, nine of whom had received lidocaine, and four patients died from asystole, three of whom had had lidocaine. We cannot advocate the administration of lidocaine prophylactically in the early hours of suspected myocardial infarction.
Four mutations--R778L, A874V, L1083F, and 2304delC--in the copper-transporting enzyme, P-type ATPase (ATP7B), were identified in Korean Patients with Wilson disease. Arg778Leu, the most frequently reported mutation of this enzyme, was found in six of eight unrelated patients studied, an allele frequency of 37. 5%, which is considerably higher than those in other Asian populations. The novel single nucleotide deletion, 2304delC, was found in one patient. Since a mutation at cDNA nucleotide 2302 (2302insC) had been previously described, this region of the ATP7B gene may be susceptible to gene rearrangements causing Wilson disease.
Four new G6PD variants have been characterized in individuals from Papua New Guinea. This study demonstrates that the previously reported Markham variant and the newly characterized Salata variant may be widely distributed in Papua New Guinea. Th data presented here together with those of previously published studies demonstrate a degree of heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency that is much higher than that in other regions of the world where G6PD deficiency is common..
Four novel PEPD alleles causing prolidase deficiency.
Four out of 23 consecutive patients treated with high-dose Ara-C for lymphomas in our institution developed a strikingly similar syndrome during the perfusion. It was characterized by the onset of fever, diarrhea, shock, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, weight gain and leukocytosis. Thorough bacteriological screening failed to provide evidence of infection. Sequential biological assays of IL-1, IL-2, TNF and PAF were performed during Ara-C infusion to ten patients, including the four who developed the syndrome. TNF and PAF activity was found in the serum of respectively two and four of the cases, but not in the six controls. As TNF and PAF are thought to be involved in the development of septic shock and adult respiratory distress syndrome, we hypothesize that high-dose Ara-C may be associated with cytokine release.
Four patients who were rendered comatose or stuporous by drug intoxication, but who were not hypoxic, are described. Three patients received high doses of chlormethiazole for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and one took a suicidal overdose of nitrazepam. The patient with nitrazepam overdose and two of those with chlormethiazole intoxication conformed to the criteria of 'alpha coma', showing non-reactive generalized or frontally predominant alpha activity in the EEG. The fourth patient who was unconscious after chlormethiazole administration exhibite generalized non-reactive activity in the slow beta range. All four recovered completely without neurological sequelae following the withdrawal of the offending agents. The similarities between the effects of structural lesions and pharmacological depression of the brain stem reticular formation are discussed. It is suggested that in both situations disturbed reticulo-thalamic interactions are important in the pathogenesis of alpha coma. It is concluded that when this electroencephalographic and behavioural picture is seen in drug intoxication, in the absence of significant hypoxaemia, a favourable outcome may be anticipated.
Four patients with rheumatoid arthritis developed heavy proteinuria after five to 12 months of treatment with D-penicillamine. Light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase, or no departure from normal. Electron microscopy, however, revealed subepithelial electron-dense deposits, fusion of epithelial cell foot processes, and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C3. The findings were similar to those in early membranous glomerulonephritis, differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early-acting complement components C1q and C4. It is tentatively concluded that complement was activated by the classical pathway.
Fourteen of 39 dialysis patients (36%) became hypercalcemic after switching to calcium carbonate as their principal phosphate binder. In order to identify risk factors associated with the development of hypercalcemia, indirect parameters of intestinal calcium reabsorption and bone turnover rate in these 14 patients were compared with results in 14 eucalcemic patients matched for age, sex, length of time on dialysis, and etiology of renal disease. In addition to experiencing hypercalcemic episodes with peak calcium values of 2.7 to 3.8 mmol/L (10.7 to 15.0 mg/dL), patients in the hypercalcemic group exhibited a significant increase in the mean calcium concentration obtained during 6 months before the switch, compared with the mean value obtained during the 7 months of observation after the switch (2.4 +/- 0.03 to 2.5 +/- 0.03 mmol/L [9.7 +/- 0.2 to 10.2 +/- 0.1 mg/dL], P = 0.006). In contrast, eucalcemic patients exhibited no change in mean calcium values over the same time period (2.3 +/- 0.05 to 2.3 +/- 0.05 mmol/L [9.2 +/- 0.2 to 9.2 +/- 0.2 mg/dL]). CaCO3 dosage, calculated dietary calcium intake, and circulating levels of vitamin D metabolites were similar in both groups. Physical activity index and predialysis serum bicarbonate levels also were similar in both groups. However, there was a significant difference in parameters reflecting bone turnover rates between groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Fragile X syndrome is a common cause of mental retardation involving loss of expression of the FMR1 gene. The role of FMR1 remains undetermined but the protein appears to be involved in RNA metabolism. Fmr1 knockout mice exhibit a phenotype with some similarities to humans, such as macroorchidism and behavioral abnormalities. As a step toward understanding the function of FMR1 and the determination of the potential for therapeutic approaches to fragile X syndrome, yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) transgenic mice were generated in order to determine whether the Fmr1 knockout mouse phenotype could be rescued. Several transgenic lines were generated that carried the entire FMR1 locus with extensive amounts of flanking sequence. We observed that the YAC transgene supported production of the human protein (FMRP) which was present at levels 10 to 15 times that of endogenous protein and was expressed in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. Macro-orchidism was absent in knockout mice carrying the YAC transgene indicating functional rescue by the human protein. Given the complex behavioral phenotype in fragile X patients and the mild phenotype previously reported for the Fmr1 knockout mouse, we performed a more thorough evaluation of the Fmr1 knockout phenotype using additional behavioral assays that had not previously been reported for this animal model. The mouse displayed reduced anxiety-related responses with increased exploratory behavior. FMR1 YAC transgenic mice overexpressing the human protein did produce opposing behavioral responses and additional abnormal behaviors were also observed. These findings have significant implications for gene therapy for fragile X syndrome since overexpression of the gene may harbor its own phenotype..
Fragile X syndrome without CCG amplification has an FMR1 deletion.
Fragile X syndrome, a common form of inherited mental retardation, is mainly caused by massive expansion of CGG triplet repeats located in the 5-untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation-1 (FMR1) gene. In patients with fragile X syndrome, the expanded CGG triplet repeats are hypermethylated and the expression of the FMR1 gene is repressed, which leads to the absence of FMR1 protein (FMRP) and subsequent mental retardation. FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. This protein has been implicated in protein translation as it is found associated with polyribosomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum. We discuss here the recent progress made towards understanding the molecular mechanism of CGG repeat expansion and physiological function (s) of FMRP. These studies will not only help to illuminate the molecular basis of the general class of human diseases with trinucleotide repeat expansion but also provide an avenue to understand aspects of human cognition and intelligence..
Fragments of the adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) cDNA from a patient with adolescent ALD were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned. Bidirectional sequencing of the entire coding ALD gene disclosed a cytosine to guanine transversion at nucleotide 1451 in exon five, resulting in substitution of proline 484 by arginine. Five of nine siblings of the patient, comprising two cerebral ALD, one adrenomyeloneuropathy, one Addison only as well as the symptomatic mother (all accumulating very long chain fatty acids) carried this mutation, which was not found in the unaffected persons, in five unrelated ALD patients, and in twenty controls. We propose that this missense mutation generated the disease per se as well as the metabolic defect; the different phenotypes, however, must have originated by means of additional pathogenetic factors..
Fragments of the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene from a patient with juvenile-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) were amplified by PCR and ligated into MP13 cloning vectors. Clones hybridizing with cDNA for human ARSA were selected, examined for appropriate size inserts, and used to prepare single-stranded phage DNA. Examination of the entire coding and most of the intronic sequence revealed two putative disease-related mutations. One, a point mutation in exon 3, resulted in the substitution of isoleucine by serine. Introduction of this alteration into the normal ARSA cDNA sequence resulted in a substantial decrease in ARSA activity on transient expression in cultured baby hamster kidney cells. About 5% of the control expression was observed, suggesting a small residual activity in the mutated ARSA. The second mutation, a G-to-A transition, occurred in the other allele and resulted in an altered splice-recognition sequence between exon 7 and the following intron. The mutation also resulted in the loss of a restriction site. Apparently normal levels of mRNA were generated from this allele, but no ARSA activity or immuno-cross-reactive material could be detected. A collection of DNA samples from known or suspected MLD patients, members of their families, and normal controls was screened for these mutations. Four additional individuals carrying each of the mutations were found among the nearly 100 MLD patients in the sample. Gene segregation in the original patients family was consistent with available clinical and biochemical data. No individuals homozygous for either of these two mutations were identified. However, combinations with other MLD mutations suggest that the point mutation in exon 3 does result in some residual enzyme activity and is associated with late-onset forms of the disease. The splice-site mutation following exon 7 produces late-infantile MLD when combined with other enzyme-null mutations, implying that it is completely silent enzymatically..
Frataxin deficiency is the primary cause of Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive cardiodegenerative and neurodegenerative disease. Frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that is widely conserved among eukaryotes. Genetic inactivation of the yeast frataxin homologue (Yfh1p) results in mitochondrial iron accumulation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Increased iron deposition and evidence of oxidative damage have also been observed in cardiac tissue and cultured fibroblasts from patients with FRDA. These findings indicate that frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from iron-induced formation of free radicals. The functional mechanism of frataxin, however, is still unknown. We have expressed the mature form of Yfh1p (mYfh1p) in Escherichia coli and have analyzed its function in vitro. Isolated mYfh1p is a soluble monomer (13, 783 Da) that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency to self-associate. Aerobic addition of ferrous iron to mYfh1p results in assembly of regular spherical multimers with a molecular mass of approximately 1. 1 MDa (megadaltons) and a diameter of 13 +/-2 nm. Each multimer consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester > 3, 000 atoms of iron. Titration of mYfh1p with increasing iron concentrations supports a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly. Sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent results in quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer, indicating that mYfh1p sequesters iron in an available form. In yeast mitochondria, native mYfh1p exists as monomer and a higher-order species with a molecular weight > 600, 000. After addition of (55) Fe to the medium, immunoprecipitates of this species contain > 16 atoms of (55) Fe per molecule of mYfh1p. We propose that iron-dependent self-assembly of recombinant mYfh1p reflects a physiological role for frataxin in mitochondrial iron sequestration and bioavailability..

Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common form of autosomal recessive ataxia. The disease locus was assigned to chromosome 9 and the disease gene, STM7/X25, has been isolated. To date most data suggest locus homogeneity in FRDA. We now provide strong evidence of a second FRDA locus. Studying two siblings with FRDA from two families we did not detect a mutation in STM7/X25. Haplotype analysis of the STM7/X25 region of chromosome 9 demonstrated that the relevant portion of chromosome 9 differs in the patients. Although the patients studied had typical FRDA, one sibpair had the uncommon symptom of retained tendon reflexes. In order to investigate whether retained tendon reflexes are characteristic of FRDA caused by the second locus, FRDA2, we studied an unrelated FRDA patient with retained tendon reflexes. The observation of typical mutations in STM7/X25 (GAA expansions) in this patient demonstrates that the two genetically different forms of FRDA cannot be distinguished clinically..
Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common inherited ataxia. About 98% of mutant alleles have an expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the affected gene, FRDA. The other 2% are point mutations. Of the 17 point mutations so far described, three appear to be more common. One of these is the G130V mutation in exon 4 of FRDA. G130V, when present with an expanded GAA repeat on the other allele, is associated with an atypical FRDA phenotype. Haplotype analysis was undertaken on the four families who have been described with this mutation. The results suggest a common founder for this mutation. Although marked differences in extragenic marker haplotypes were seen in one family, similar intragenic haplotyping suggests the same mutation founder for this family with the differences explicable by two recombination events..
Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common autosomal recessive ataxia, is caused in almost all cases by homozygous intronic expansions resulting in the loss of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein conserved through evolution, and involved in mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Yeast knockout models, and histological and biochemical data from patient heart biopsies or autopsies indicate that the frataxin defect causes a specific iron-sulfur protein deficiency and mitochondrial iron accumulation leading to the pathological changes. Affected human tissues are rarely available to further examine this hypothesis. To study the mechanism of the disease, we generated a mouse model by deletion of exon 4 leading to inactivation of the Frda gene product. We show that homozygous deletions cause embryonic lethality a few days after implantation, demonstrating an important role for frataxin during early development. These results suggest that the milder phenotype in humans is due to residual frataxin expression associated with the expansion mutations. Surprisingly, in the frataxin knockout mouse, no iron accumulation was observed during embryonic resorption, suggesting that cell death could be due to a mechanism independent of iron accumulation..
Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common of the inherited ataxias, is an autosomal recessive degenerative disorder, characterized clinically by onset before the age of 25 of progressive gait and limb ataxia, absence of deep tendon reflexes, extensor plantar responses, and loss of position and vibration sense in the lower limbs. FRDA is caused by a GAA triplet expansion in the first intron of the FRDA gene on chromosome 9q13 in 97% of patients. The FRDA gene encodes a widely expressed 210-aa protein, frataxin, which is located in mitochondria and is severely reduced in FRDA patients. Frataxin function is still unknown but the knockout of the yeast frataxin homologue gene (YFH1) showed a severe defect of mitochondrial respiration and loss of mtDNA associated with elevated intramitochondrial iron. Here we report in vivo evidence of impaired mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle of FRDA patients. Using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy we demonstrated a maximum rate of muscle mitochondrial ATP production (V (max)) below the normal range in all 12 FRDA patients and a strong negative correlation between mitochondrial V (max) and the number of GAA repeats in the smaller allele. Our results show that FRDA is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial disorder affecting oxidative phosphorylation and give a rationale for treatments aimed to improve mitochondrial function in this condition..
Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most frequently inherited ataxia, is due in the vast majority of cases to a large expansion of an intronic GAA repeat. Using linkage disequilibrium analysis based on haplotype data of seven polymorphic markers close to the frataxin gene, the age of FRDA founding mutational event (s) is estimated to be at least 682 +/-203 generations (95% confidence interval 564-801 g), a dating which is consistent with little or no negative selection and provides further evidence for an ancient spread of a pre-mutation (at-risk alleles) in western Europe..
Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the FRDA gene that encodes a 210-amino acid protein called frataxin. An expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the gene is present in more than 95% of mutant alleles. Of the 83 people we studied who have mutations in FRDA, 78 are homozygous for an expanded GAA repeat; the other five patients have an expansion in one allele and a point mutation in the other. Here we present a detailed clinical and genetic study of a subset of 51 patients homozygous for an expansion of the GAA repeat. We found a correlation between the size of the smaller of the two expanded alleles and age at onset, age into wheelchair, scoliosis, impaired vibration sense, and the presence of foot deformity. There was no significant correlation between the size of the smaller allele and cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, loss of proprioception, or bladder symptoms. The larger allele size correlated with bladder symptoms and the presence of foot deformity. The duration of disease is correlated with wheelchair use and the presence of diabetes, scoliosis, bladder symptoms and impaired proprioception, and vibration sense but no other complications studied..
Friedreich ataxia is usually caused by an expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the FRDA gene. Occasionally, a fully expanded allele has been found to arise from a premutation of 100 or less triplet repeats. We have examined the sperm DNA of a premutation carrier. This mans leucocyte DNA showed one normal allele and one allele of approximately 100 repeats. His sperm showed an expanded allele in a tight range centering on a size of approximately 320 trinucleotide repeats. His affected son has repeat sizes of 1040 and 540. These data suggest that expansion occurs in two stages, the first during meiosis followed by a second mitotic expansion. We also show that in all informative carrier father to affected child transmissions, with the notable exception of the premutation carrier, the expansion size decreases..
Friedreich ataxia, an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease, is the most common of the inherited ataxias. The recent discovery of the gene that is mutated in this condition, FRDA, has led to rapid advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of Friedreich ataxia. About 98% of mutant alleles have an expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the gene. This leads to reduced levels of the protein, frataxin. There is mounting evidence to suggest that Friedreich ataxia is the result of accumulation of iron in mitochondria leading to excess production of free radicals, which then results in cellular damage and death. Currently there is no known treatment that alters the natural course of the disease. The discovery of the FRDA gene and its possible function has raised hope that rational therapeutic strategies will be developed..
Friedreich ataxia: an overview.
From 1986 to 1998, 29 cancer patients who had 32 episodes of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were identified. None of the patients had decompensated liver disease. Onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy varied from 0.5 to 5 days (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.3 days) after the initiation of chemotherapy. Plasma ammonium level ranged from 248 to 2387 microg% (mean: 626 +/- 431 microg%). Among the 32 episodes, 26 (81%) had various degrees of azotemia, 18 (56%) occurred during bacterial infections and 14 (44%) without infection occurred during periods of dehydration. Higher plasma ammonium levels and more rapid onset of hyperammonemia were seen in 18 patients with bacterial infections (p=0.003 and 0.0006, respectively) and in nine patients receiving high daily doses (2600 or 1800 mg/m2) of 5-FU (p=0.0001 and < 0.0001, respectively). In 25 out of 32 episodes (78%), plasma ammonium levels and mental status returned to normal within 2 days after adequate management. In conclusion, hyperammonemic encephalopathy can occur in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5-FU. Azotemia, body fluid insufficiency and bacterial infections were frequently found in these patients. It is therefore important to recognize this condition in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5-FU.
From 1986 to February 1993, 40 children aged 2 months to 18 years (average age 10.4 +/- 5.8 years) underwent heart transplantation. Indications for transplantation were idiopathic cardiomyopathy (52%), congenital heart disease (35%) with and without prior repair (71% and 29%, respectively), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (5%), valvular heart disease (3%), and doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (5%). Patients were managed with cyclosporine and azathioprine. No prophylaxis with antilymphocyte globulin was used. Steroids were given to 39% of patients for refractory rejection, but weaning was always attempted and generally successful (64%). Five patients (14%) received maintenance steroids. Four patients died in the perioperative period and one died 4 months later. There have been no deaths related to rejection or infection. Average follow-up was 36 +/- 19 months (range 1 to 65 months). Cumulative survival is 88% at 5 years. In patients less than 7 years of age, rejection was monitored noninvasively. In the first postoperative month, 89% of patients were treated for rejection. Freedom from serious infections was 83% at 1 month and 65% at 1 year. Cytomegalovirus infections were treated successfully with ganciclovir in 11 patients. No impairment of growth was observed in children who underwent transplantation compared with a control population. Twenty-one patients (60%) have undergone annual catheterizations and no sign of graft atherosclerosis has been observed. Seizures occurred in five patients (14%) and hypertension was treated in 10 patients (28%). No patient was disabled and no lymphoproliferative disorder was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
From data collected in a North American Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) heterozygote screening program, the TSD carrier frequency among 46, 304 Jewish individuals was found to be. 0324 (1 in 31 individuals). This frequency is consistent with earlier estimates based on TSD incidence data. TSD carrier frequencies were then examined by single country and single region of origin in 28, 029 Jews within this sample for whom such data were available for analysis. Jews with Polish and/or Russian ancestry constituted 88% of this sample and had a TSD carrier frequency of. 0327. No TSD carriers were observed among the 166 Jews of Near Eastern origins. Relative to Jews of Polish and Russian origins, there was at least a twofold increase in the TSD carrier frequency in Jews of Austrian, Hungarian, and Czechoslovakian origins (P less than. 005). These findings suggest that the TSD gene proliferated among the antecedents of modern Ashkenazi Jewry after the Second Diaspora (70 A. D.) and before their major migrations to regions of Poland and Russia (before 1100 A. D.).
Fully developed cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis is characterized by nearly complete detachment of the urothelium, severe submucosal edema owing to damage to the microvascular bed and focal muscle necroses. The initial response to the primary attack by the cyclophosphamide metabolites seems to be fragmentation of the luminal membrane. This damages the cellular barrier against the hypertonic urine. Subsequent breaks in the lateral cell membranes of the superficial cells and in all the plasma membranes of the intermediate and basal cells, intercellular and intracellular edema and disintegration of the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes lead to progressive degeneration and detachment of the epithelial cells with exposure and splitting of the basal membrane. The morphological changes of the endothelial cells, which become more pronounced in the later stages of the experiment, the involvement of blood vessels regardless of their diameter and the location-dependent extent of the damage indicate a direct type of damage which is preceded by a mediator-induced increase in permeability, the morphological correlate of which is the formation of gaps in the interendothelial cell connections on the venules. These changes can be effectively prevented by mesna. The only sign of a possible involvement is the increase in the number of specific granules with a presumed lysosomal function in the superficial cells.

Further studies on the effects of certain irrigating fluids on the rat bladder for 18 hours are reported.

A high percentage of kanamycin-colistin and povidone-iodine irrigations were associated with erosive cystitis and suggested a possible complication with human usage. Picloxydine irrigations appeared to have a lower incidence of erosive cystitis but further studies would have to be performed before it could be recommended for use in urological procedures.
Fusidic acid is an antibiotic with T-cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of cyclosporin. Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Crohn's disease, a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusidic acid treatment in chronic active, therapy-resistant patients. Eight Crohn's disease patients were included. Fusidic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t.d.s. and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks. The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score. Five of 8 patients (63%) improved during fusidic acid treatment: 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks. There were no serious clinical side effects, but dose reduction was required in two patients because of nausea. Biochemically, an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases (63%), and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment. All reversed to pre-treatment levels after cessation of treatment. The results of this pilot study suggest that fusidic acid may be of benefit in selected chronic active Crohn's disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective. Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of fusidic acid at the cytokine level in inflammatory bowel disease, we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated.
Fusion genes resulting from alternative chromosomal translocations are overexpressed by gene-specific mechanisms in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) represent the single most important drug targets for medical therapy, and information from genome sequencing and genomic data bases has substantially accelerated their discovery. The lack of a systematic approach either to identify the function of a new GPCR or to associate it with a cognate ligand has added to the growing number of orphan receptors. In this work we provide a novel approach to this problem using a beta-arrestin2/green fluorescent protein conjugate (betaarr2-GFP). It provides a real-time and single cell based assay to monitor GPCR activation and GPCR-G protein-coupled receptor kinase or GPCR-arrestin interactions. Confocal microscopy demonstrates the translocation of betaarr2-GFP to more than 15 different ligand-activated GPCRs. These data clearly support the common hypothesis that the beta-arrestin binding of an activated receptor is a convergent step of GPCR signaling, increase by 5-fold the number of GPCRs known to interact with beta-arrestins, demonstrate that the cytosol is the predominant reservoir of biologically active beta-arrestins, and provide the first direct demonstration of the critical importance of G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation to the biological regulation of beta-arrestin activity and GPCR signal transduction in living cells. The use of betaarr2-GFP as a biosensor to recognize the activation of pharmacologically distinct GPCRs should accelerate the identification of orphan receptors and permit the optical study of their signal transduction biology intractable to ordinary biochemical methods.
G protein-coupled receptors such as the receptors for bradykinin are present in low copy numbers in most natural cells. To overcome the problems associated with the analysis of these receptors at the protein level, we used highly efficient expression systems such as the baculovirus/insect cell system. However, the structural and functional statuses of recombinant receptors have often remained elusive. We have expressed the two types of human kinin receptors, B1 and B2, in Sf9 cells. Both receptors are found on the surface of infected cells where they display the same pharmacological profiles as their cognate receptors of native cells. The functional analysis of kinin receptors coupled to the intracellular signaling pathways of Sf9 cells revealed differential patterns of ligand-induced phosphorylation for the two kinin receptors. The B1 receptor failed to undergo ligand-induced phosphorylation. However the B2 receptor showed selective phosphorylation of a minor 38 kDa band and lack of phosphorylation of a dominant 33 kDa band, indicating that only a fraction of the receptor protein is functionally linked to the kinase pathway. A striking discrepancy between the number of binding sites and the amount of receptor protein per cell (molar ratio of 1:20 to 1:1000) indicated that a significant portion of kinin receptors is associated with the intracellular compartments of Sf9 cells. Pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the heterogeneity of recombinant receptors is not due to proteolytic processing but likely reflects incomplete or lacking N-glycosylation. We conclude that the baculovirus/Sf9 system is suitable for the recombinant expression and functional analysis of kinin receptors though limitations of the system have to be considered.
G(olf) alpha is a G-protein originally believed to mediate signal transduction exclusively within the olfactory neuroepithelium and subsequently found to be a major stimulatory G-protein in the basal ganglia. Here we present evidence that G(olf) alpha is expressed in several other tissues. The human isoform of G(olf) alpha was isolated from two human insulinoma cDNA libraries. Comparison of the human sequence with rat G(olf) alpha shows 91% nucleotide identity (within the coding region) and 99% identity at the amino acid level. Northern and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that G(olf) alpha is expressed in all human insulinomas examined thus far as well as in normal pancreatic islets. G(olf) alpha mRNA was also detected in testis, retina, brain, and liver. Western blot analysis of various mouse tissues demonstrated that the level of G(olf) alpha protein in islets is lower than that in the olfactory neuroepithelium and other parts of the brain; its expression in retina, lung, and spleen was moderately higher than that in islets, and its expression in testis approached that in olfactory neuroepithelium. G(olf) alpha was also detected by immunohistochemistry in mouse islets, human insulinomas, the epithelial lining of mouse epididymis, photoreceptor cells of mouse retina, and mouse lung alveoli. These findings suggest a role for G(olf) alpha in a diverse population of cells located outside the olfactory neuroepithelium and central nervous system.

GM1-gangliosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of acid beta-galactosidase (GLB1). We report five new beta-galactosidase gene mutations in nine Italian patients and one fetus, segregating in seven unrelated families. Six of the eight patients with the infantile, severe form of the disease presented cardiac involvement, a feature rarely associated with GM1-gangliosidosis. Molecular analysis of the patients RNA and DNA identified two new RNA splicing defects, three new and three previously described amino acid substitutions. Interestingly, all patients with cardiac involvement were homozygous for one of these mutations R59H, Y591C, Y591N, or IVS14-2A > G. In contrast, all other patients were compound heterozygous for one of the following mutations R201H, R482H, G579D, IVS8 + 2T > C. Although we could not directly correlate the presence of cardiac abnormalities with specific genetic lesions, the mutations identified in patients with cardiomyopathy fell in the GLB1 cDNA region common to the lysosomal enzyme and the Hbeta-Gal-related protein, also known as the elastin binding protein (EBP). Consequently, both molecules are affected by the mutations, and they may contribute differently to the occurrence of specific clinical manifestations..
GT to AT transition at a splice donor site causes skipping of the preceding exon in phenylketonuria.
GTPases of the Rho family control a wide variety of cellular processes such as cell morphology, motility, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We report here the characterization of a new Rho member, which shares 85% and 78% amino acid similarity to TC10 and Cdc42, respectively. This GTPase, termed as TC10-like (TCL) is encoded by an unexpectedly large locus, made of five exons spanning over 85 kilobases on human chromosome 14. TCL mRNA is 2.5 kilobases long and is mainly expressed in heart. In vitro, TCL shows rapid GDP/GTP exchange and displays higher GTP dissociation and hydolysis rates than TC10. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and GST pull-down assays, we show that GTP-bound but not GDP-bound TCL protein directly interacts with Cdc42/Rac interacting binding domains, such as those found in PAK and WASP. Despite its overall similarity to TC10 and Cdc42, the constitutively active TCL mutant displays distinct morphogenic activity in REF-52 fibroblasts, producing large and dynamic F-actin-rich ruffles on the dorsal cell membrane. Interestingly, TCL morphogenic activity is blocked by dominant negative Rac1 and Cdc42 mutants, suggesting a cross-talk between these three Rho GTPases.
Galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of human galactose metabolism caused by deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). The molecular basis of this disorder is at present not well understood. We report here two missense mutations which result in low or undetectable enzymatic activity. First, we identified at nucleotide 591 a transition which substitutes glutamine 188 by arginine. The mutated glutamine is not only highly conserved in evolution (conserved also in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), but is also two amino acid residues downstream from the active site histidine-proline-histidine triad and results in about 10% of normal enzymatic activity. The arginine 188 mutation is the most common galactosemia mutation characterized to date. It accounts for one-fourth of the galactosemia alleles studied. Second, we report the substitution of arginine 333 by tryptophan, caused by a transition at nucleotide 1025. The area surrounding this missense mutation is the most highly conserved domain in the homologous enzymes from E. coli, yeast, and humans, and this mutation results in undetectable enzymatic activity, suggesting that this is a severe mutation. This second mutation appears to be rare, since it was found only in the patient we sequenced. Our data provide further evidence for the heterogeneity of galactosemia at the molecular level, heterogeneity which might be related to the variable clinical outcome observed in this disorder..
Galanthamine hydrobromide, a longer acting anticholinesterase drug, in the treatment of the central effects of scopolamine (Hyoscine).
Galanthamine hydrobromide, an anticholinesterase drug capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier, was used in a patient demonstrating central effects of scopolamine (hyoscine) overdosage. It is longer acting than physostigmine and is used in anaesthesia to reverse the non-depolarizing neuromuscular block. However, studies into the dose necessary to combating scopolamine intoxication are indicated.
Gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH), the active ingredient of the insecticide lindane, has been shown to decrease seizure threshold to pentylenetrazol (PTZ) 3 h after exposure to gamma-HCH and conversely increase threshold to PTZ-induced seizures 24 h after exposure to gamma-HCH (Vohland et al. 1981). In this study, the severity of response to other seizure-inducing agents was tested in mice 1 and 24 h after intraperitoneal administration of 80 mg/kg gamma-HCH. One hour after the administration of gamma-HCH, the activity of seizure-inducing agents was increased, regardless of their mechanism, while 24 h after gamma-HCH a differential response was observed. Seizure activity due to PTZ and picrotoxin (PTX) was significantly decreased; however, seizure activity due to 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), bicuculline (BCC), methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-B-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), or strychnine (STR) was not different from control. In vitro, gamma-HCH, pentylenetetrazol and picrotoxin were shown to inhibit 3H-TBOB binding in mouse whole brain, with IC50 values of 4.6, 404 and 9.4 microM, respectively. MPA, BCC, DMCM, and STR showed no inhibition of 3H-TBOB (t-butyl bicyclo-orthobenzoate) binding at concentrations of 100 micron. The pharmacological challenge data suggest that tolerance may occur to seizure activity induced by PTZ and PTX 24 h after gamma-HCH, since the response to only these two seizure-inducing agents is decreased. The in vitro data suggest that the site responsible for the decrease in seizure activity 24 h after gamma-HCH may be the GABA-A receptor-linked chloride channel.
Garcinielliptone FC (GFC) isolated from hexanic fraction seed extract of species Platonia insignis Mart. It is widely used in folk medicine to treat skin diseases in both humans and animals as well as the seed decoction has been used to treat diarrheas and inflammatory diseases. However, there is no research on GFC effects in the central nervous system of rodents. The present study aimed to evaluate the GFC effects at doses of 25, 50 or 75 mg/kg on seizure parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on amino acid (r-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamine, aspartate and glutathione) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in mice hippocampus after seizures. GFC produced an increased latency to first seizure, at doses 25mg/kg (20.12 + 2.20 min), 50mg/kg (20.95 + 2.21 min) or 75 mg/kg (23.43 + 1.99 min) when compared with seized mice. In addition, GABA content of mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase of 46.90% when compared with seized mice. In aspartate, glutamine and glutamate levels detected a decrease of 5.21%, 13.55% and 21.80%, respectively in mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 when compared with seized mice. Hippocampus mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase in AChE activity (63.30%) when compared with seized mice. The results indicate that GFC can exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of installation of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, as demonstrated by increase in latency to first seizure and decrease in mortality rate of animals. In conclusion, our data suggest that GFC may influence in epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in pilocarpine model by modulating the GABA and glutamate contents and of AChE activity in seized mice hippocampus. This compound may be useful to produce neuronal protection and it can be considered as an anticonvulsant agent.
Gardner syndrome in a boy with interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5.
Gastrointestinal abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been known for almost two centuries, but many aspects concerning their pathophysiology have not been completely clarified. The aim of this study was to characterize the oropharyngeal dynamics in PD patients with and without levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Fifteen dyskinetic, 12 nondyskinetic patients, and a control group were included. Patients were asked about dysphagia and evaluated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Parts II and III and the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Deglutition was assessed using modified barium swallow with videofluoroscopy. Nondyskinetic patients, but not the dyskinetic ones, showed less oropharyngeal swallowing efficiency (OPSE) for liquid food than controls (Dunnett, P = 0.02). Dyskinetic patients tended to have a greater OPSE than nondyskinetic (Dunnett, P = 0.06). Patients who were using a higher dose of levodopa had a greater OPSE and a trend toward a smaller oral transit time (Pearson's correlation, P = 0.01 and 0.08, respectively). Neither the report of dysphagia nor any of the PD severity parameters correlated to the videofluoroscopic variables. In the current study, dyskinetic patients performed better in swallowing function, which could be explained on the basis of a greater levodopa dose. Our results suggest a role for levodopa in the oral phase of deglutition and confirm that dysphagia is not a good predictor of deglutition alterations in PD.

Gaucher disease (GD) is an inherited deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase (EC 3. 1. 2. 45, gene symbol GBA). In type I GD, the CNS is not involved (nonneuronopathic), whereas in type II GD (acute neuronopathic) CNS involvement is early and rapidly progressive, while in type III GD (subacute neuronopathic) CNS involvement occurs later and is slowly progressive. The T6433C (L444P) substitution is prevalent in type GD II. It may occur alone as a single base-pair mutation but often is found as part of a complex allele containing additional GBA nucleotide substitutions, G6468C (A456P) and G6482C (V460V), without (recNciI) or with (recTL) G5957C (D409H). This complex allele is presumed to have formed by recombination (crossover, fusion) of the structural gene with the pseudogene, which contains the mutated sequences. Two complex alleles have never been demonstrated to coexist in any individual. We devised a selective PCR method for the specific amplification of the normal and/or fusion gene. Using this procedure we demonstrated the fusion gene in homozygous form for the first time, in a Macedonian/Ashkenazi Jewish GD type II fetus. Both parents were carriers of the recombination. This was confirmed by direct sequence analysis. A previous conceptus in this family was stillborn at 36 weeks, with features of severe type II GD. Neonates showing a severe clinical phenotype, analogous to the early neonatal lethal disease occurring in mice homozygous for a null allele produced by targeted disruption of GBA, have been described elsewhere, but the specific mutations in these cases have not yet been characterized.

Gene activation in eukaryotes is regulated by complex mechanisms in which the recruitment and assembly of the transcriptional machinery is directed by gene- and cell-type-specific DNA-binding proteins. When DNA is packaged into chromatin, the regulation of gene activation requires new classes of chromatin-targeting activity. In humans, a multisubunit cofactor functions in a chromatin-selective manner to potentiate synergistic gene activation by the transcriptional activators SREBP-1a and Sp1. Here we show that this activator-recruited cofactor (ARC) interacts directly with several different activators, including SREBP-1a, VP16 and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB, and strongly enhances transcription directed by these activators in vitro with chromatin-assembled DNA templates. The ARC complex consists of 16 or more subunits; some of these are novel gene products, whereas others are present in other multisubunit cofactors, such as CRSP, NAT and mammalian Mediator. Detailed analysis indicates that the ARC complex is probably identical to the nuclear hormone-receptor cofactor DRIP. Thus, ARC/DRIP is a large composite co-activator that belongs to a family of related cofactors and is targeted by different classes of activator to mediate transcriptional stimulation.

Generalized peeling skin disease is an autosomal-recessive ichthyosiform erythroderma characterized by lifelong patchy peeling of the skin. After genome-wide linkage analysis, we have identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in CDSN in a large consanguineous family with generalized peeling skin, pruritus, and food allergies, which leads to a complete loss of corneodesmosin. In contrast to hypotrichosis simplex, which can be associated with specific dominant CDSN mutations, peeling skin disease is characterized by a complete loss of CDSN expression. The skin phenotype is consistent with a recent murine Cdsn knockout model. Using three-dimensional human skin models, we demonstrate that lack of corneodesmosin causes an epidermal barrier defect supposed to account for the predisposition to atopic diseases, and we confirm the role of corneodesmosin as a decisive epidermal adhesion molecule. Therefore, peeling skin disease will represent a new model disorder for atopic diseases, similarly to Netherton syndrome and ichthyosis vulgaris in the recent past.

Genetic determinants of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in the general population are poorly understood. We previously described plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) deficiency due to an intron 14 G (+ 1) -to-A mutation (Int14 A) in several families with very high HDL-C levels in Japan. Subjects with HDL-C > or = 100 mg/dl (n = 130) were screened by PCR single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of the CETP gene. Two other mutations were identified by DNA sequencing or primer-mediated restriction map modification of PCR products a novel intron 14 splice donor site mutation caused by a T insertion at position + 3 from the exon14/intron14 boundary (Int14 T) and a missense mutation (Asp442 to Gly) within exon 15 (D442G). The Int14 T mutation was only found in one family. However, the D442G and Int14 A mutations were highly prevalent in subjects with HDL-C > or = 60 mg/dl, with combined allele frequencies of 9%, 12%, 21% and 43% for HDL-C 60-79, 80-99, 100-119, and > or = 120 mg/dl, respectively. Furthermore, prevalences of the D442G and Int14 A mutations were extremely high in a general sample of Japanese men (n = 236), with heterozygote frequencies of 7% and 2%, respectively. These two mutations accounted for about 10% of the total variance of HDL-C in this population. The phenotype in a genetic compound heterozygote (Int14 T and Int14 A) was similar to that of Int14 A homozygotes (no detectable CETP and markedly increased HDL-C), indicating that the Int14 T produces a null allele. In four D442G homozygotes, mean HDL-C levels (86 +/- 26 mg/dl) were lower than in Int14 A homozygotes (158 +/- 35 mg/dl), reflecting residual CETP activity in plasma. In 47 D442G heterozygotes, mean HDL-C levels were 91 +/- 23 mg/dl, similar to the level in D442G homozygotes, and significantly greater than mean HDL-C levels in Int14 A heterozygotes (69 +/- 15 mg/dl). Thus, the D442G mutation acts differently to the null mutations with weaker effects on HDL in the homozygous state and stronger effects in the heterozygotes, suggesting dominant expression of a partially defective allele. CETP deficiency, reflecting two prevalent mutations (D442G and Int14 A), is the first example of a genetic deficiency state which is sufficiently common to explain a significant fraction of the variation in HDL-C in the general population..
Genetic epidemiological evidence suggests that mutations in BRCA1 may be responsible for approximately one half of early onset familial breast cancer and the majority of familial breast/ovarian cancer. The recent cloning of BRCA1 allows for the direct detection of mutations, but the feasibility of presymptomatic screening for cancer susceptibility is unknown. We analyzed genomic DNA from one affected individual from each of 24 families with at least three cases of ovarian or breast cancer, using SSCP assays. Variant SSCP bands were subcloned and sequenced. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify sequence changes and to screen DNA from control individuals. Six frameshift and two missense mutations were detected in 10 different families. A frameshift mutation was detected in a male proband affected with both breast and prostate cancer. A 40-bp deletion was detected in a patient who developed intra-abdominal carcinomatosis 1 year after prophylactic oophorectomy. Mutations were detected throughout the gene, and only one was detected in more than a single family. These results provide further evidence that inherited breast and ovarian cancer can occur as a consequence of a wide array of BRCA1 mutations. These results suggests that development of a screening test for BRCA1 mutations will be technically challenging. The finding of a mutation in a family with male breast cancer, not previously thought to be related to BRCA1, also illustrates the potential difficulties of genetic counseling for individuals known to carry mutations..
Genetic hemochromatosis (GH) is believed to be a disease restricted to those of European ancestry. In northwestern Europe, > 80% of GH patients are homozygous for one mutation, the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at position 282 (C282Y) in the unprocessed protein. In a proportion of GH patients, two mutations are present, C282Y and H63D. The clinical significance of this second mutation is such that it appears to predispose 1% -2% of compound heterozygotes to expression of the disease. The distribution of the two mutations differ, C282Y being limited to those of northwestern European ancestry and H63D being found at allele frequencies > 5%, in Europe, in countries bordering the Mediterranean, in the Middle East, and in the Indian subcontinent. The C282Y mutation occurs on a haplotype that extends </= 6 Mb, suggesting that this mutation has arisen during the past 2, 000 years. The H63D mutation is older and does not occur on such a large extended haplotype, the haplotype in this case extending </= 700 kb. Here we report the finding of the H63D and C282Y mutations on new haplotypes. In Sri Lanka we have found H63D on three new haplotypes and have found C282Y on one new haplotype, demonstrating that these mutations have arisen independently on this island. These results suggest that the HFE gene has been the subject of selection pressure. These selection pressures could be due to infectious diseases, environmental conditions, or other genetic disorders such as anemia.

Genetically determined C3 deficiency in Brittany spaniel dogs shares a number of biochemical and clinical characteristics with the human disorder. In humans, the gene for C3 deficiency is a null gene that is allelic to the structural gene for C3 and is not linked to the major histocompatibility locus. The current study used allotype analysis of canine C3 in order to demonstrate that the gene for C3 deficiency in these dogs is also a null gene allelic to the structural gene for C3. In addition, preliminary pedigree analysis suggests that the gene for canine C3 deficiency is apparently not closely linked to the major histocompatibility complex of the dog. Thus, it appears that C3 deficiency in Brittany spaniel dogs not only shares biochemical and clinical features with C3 deficiency in humans, but also shares some genetic characteristics with the human disorder..

Genomic instability is a highly pleiotropic phenotype, which may reflect a variety of underlying mechanisms. Destabilization has been shown in some cases to involve mutational alteration or inactivation of trans-acting cellular factors, for example, p53 or mismatch repair functions. However, aspects of instability are not well explained by mutational inactivation of trans-acting factors, and other epigenetic and cis-acting mechanisms have recently been proposed. The trans and cis models result in divergent predictions for the distribution of instability-associated genetic alterations within the genome, and for the inheritance of genomic instability among sibling sub-clones of unstable parents. These predictions have been tested in this study primarily by tracking the karyotypic distribution of chromosomal rearrangements in clones and sub-clones exhibiting radiation-induced genomic instability; inheritance of mutator phenotypes was also analyzed. The results indicate that genomic instability is unevenly transmitted to sibling sub-clones, that chromosomal rearrangements within unstable clones are non-randomly distributed throughout the karyotype, and that the majority of chromosomal rearrangements associated with instability affect trisomic chromosomal segments. Observations of instability in trisomic regions suggests that in addition to promoting further alterations in chromosomal number, aneuploidy can affect the recovery of structural rearrangements. In summary, these findings cannot be fully explained by invoking a homogeneously distributed factor acting in trans, but do provide support for previous suggestions that genomic instability may in part be driven by a cis-acting mechanism.

Germ-line and somatic truncating mutations of the APC gene are thought to initiate colorectal tumor formation in familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome and sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis, respectively. Recently, an isoleucine-- > lysine polymorphism at codon 1307 (I1307K) of the APC gene has been identified in 6% -7% of the Ashkenazi Jewish population. To assess the risk of this common APC allelic variant in colorectal carcinogenesis, we have analyzed a large cohort of unselected Ashkenazi Jewish subjects with adenomatous polyps and. or colorectal cancer, for the APC I1307K polymorphism. The APC I1307K allele was identified in 48 (10. 1%) of 476 patients. Compared with the frequency in two separate population control groups, the APC I1307K allele is associated with an estimated relative risk of 1. 5-1. 7 for colorectal neoplasia (both P =. 01). Furthermore, compared with noncarriers, APC I1307K carriers had increased numbers of adenomas and colorectal cancers per patient (P =. 03), as well as a younger age at diagnosis. We conclude that the APC I1307K variant leads to increased adenoma formation and directly contributes to 3% -4% of all Ashkenazi Jewish colorectal cancer. The estimated relative risk for carriers may justify specific clinical screening for the 360, 000 Americans expected to harbor this allele, and genetic testing in the setting of long-term-outcome studies may impact significantly on colorectal cancer prevention in this population.
Germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 tumor-suppressor gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 contains a carboxyl-terminal domain (BRCT) that is shared with several other proteins involved in maintaining genome integrity. In an effort to understand the function of BRCA1, we sought to isolate proteins that interact with the BRCT domain. Purified BRCT polypeptide was used as a probe to screen a human placenta cDNA expression library by Far Western analysis. Here we report that BRCA1 interacts in vivo and in vitro with the Rb-binding proteins, RbAp46 and RbAp48, as well as with Rb. Moreover, the BRCT domain associates with the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. These results demonstrate that BRCA1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex, and therefore may explain the involvement of BRCA1 in multiple processes such as transcription, DNA repair, and recombination..
Germ-line mutations of the BRCA1 gene are responsible for a substantial proportion of families with multiple cases of early-onset breast and/or ovarian cancer. Since the isolation of BRCA1 last year, > 65 distinct mutations scattered throughout the coding region have been detected, making analysis of the gene time consuming and technically challenging. We have developed a multiplex heteroduplex analysis that is designed to analyze one-quarter of the coding sequence in a single-step screening procedure and that will detect approximately 50% of all BRCA1 mutations so far reported in breast/ovarian cancer families. We have used this technique to analyze BRCA1 in 162 families with a history of breast and/or ovarian cancer and identified 12 distinct mutations in 35 families..
Germ-line mutations of the BRCA1 gene predispose women to early-onset breast and ovarian cancer by compromising the genes presumptive function as a tumor suppressor. Although the biochemical properties of BRCA1 polypeptides are not understood, their expression pattern and subcellular localization suggest a role in cell-cycle regulation. When resting cells are induced to proliferate, the steady-state levels of BRCA1 increase in late G1 and reach a maximum during S phase. Moreover, in S phase cells, BRCA1 polypeptides are hyperphosphorylated and accumulate into discrete subnuclear foci termed " BRCA1 nuclear dots. " BRCA1 associates in vivo with a structurally related protein termed BARD1. Here we show that the steady-state levels of BARD1, unlike those of BRCA1, remain relatively constant during cell cycle progression. However, immunostaining revealed that BARD1 resides within BRCA1 nuclear dots during S phase of the cell cycle, but not during the G1 phase. Nevertheless, BARD1 polypeptides are found exclusively in the nuclear fractions of both G1- and S-phase cells. Therefore, progression to S phase is accompanied by the aggregation of nuclear BARD1 polypeptides into BRCA1 nuclear dots. This cell cycle-dependent colocalization of BARD1 and BRCA1 indicates a role for BARD1 in BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression.
Germ-line mutations of the tumor suppressor APC are implicated in attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC), a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). AAPC is recognized by the occurrence of < 100 colonic adenomas and a later onset of colorectal cancer (age > 40 years). The aim of this study was to assess genotype-phenotype correlations in AAPC families. By protein-truncation test (PTT) assay, the entire coding region of the APC gene was screened in affected individuals from 11 AAPC kindreds, and their phenotypic differences were examined. Five novel germ-line APC mutations were identified in seven kindreds. Mutations were located in three different regions of the APC gene (1) at the 5 end spanning exons 4 and 5, (2) within exon 9, and (3) at the 3 distal end of the gene. Variability in the number of colorectal adenomas was most apparent in individuals with mutations in region 1, and upper-gastrointestinal manifestations were more severe in them. In individuals with mutations in either region 2 or region 3, the average number of adenomas tended to be lower than those in individuals with mutations in region 1, although age at diagnosis was similar. In all AAPC kindreds, a predominance of right-sided colorectal adenomas and rectal polyp sparing was observed. No desmoid tumors were found in these kindreds. Our data suggest that, in AAPC families, the location of the APC mutation may partially predict specific phenotypic expression. This should help in the design of tailored clinical-management protocols in this subset of FAP patients..
Germfree (GF) Lobund strain Wistar (LW) rats, fed vegetable diet L-485, have developed prostate adenocarcinomas spontaneously (10% incidence) at average age 34 months. Conventional LW rats, implanted with testosterone at age 4 months, developed a higher incidence of prostate cancer after an average interval of 14 months: 24% had developed gross tumors, and 40% when it included microscopic tumors. Preliminary results indicate that testosterone-treated LW rats that were fed the same diet, which was supplemented with corn oil up to 20% fat, developed prostate cancer after intervals of 6-12 months. Aged GF Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats have not developed prostate cancer spontaneously. Conventional SD rats fed diet L-485 and treated with testosterone developed only prostatitis. Experimental designs should consider genetic susceptibility as a basic prerequisite for studies on experimental prostate cancer.

Germline mutation in APC at 5q21-22 results in the dominantly inherited syndrome adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Somatic mutation in this gene is an early event in colorectal tumourigenesis. Both types of mutation are concentrated in the 5 half of exon 15. We have used single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and heteroduplex analysis to screen for variants in this region of the gene in a total of 45 affected but unrelated individuals. Eighteen patients had no family history of the disease; of these 11 were classified as having a severe phenotype, based on an early age at presentation or cancer development. This compared with 6 of 27 familial cases. A 5 bp deletion at codon 1309 reported to occur in 10-15% of unselected APC patients worldwide, was found in 5 of the 18 new mutation cases and 4 of the 27 familial cases all nine were classed as severe. A further 3 new mutations and 1 familial mutation were located downstream from codon 1309, these individuals similarly being classed as phenotypically severe. In contrast all of the APC mutations detected in affected individuals with an average phenotype were located prior to codon 1309. The frequent association of a severe phenotype with fresh mutation may explain the apparent conflict of a high mutation rate (20-30%) in a condition, which on average, is lethal at a post-reproductive age..
Germline mutations are the major source of genetic variation that allows a species to evolve over time but at the cost of Mendelian disease and genetic predisposition to multifactorial diseases. Previous analyses have revealed that the pattern of germline mutations in the factor IX gene (F9) is similar among a variety of ethnically and geographically diverse populations and compatible with the ancient pattern that has shaped the mammalian genome. Here, we compare the pattern of germline mutation in a population of hemophilia B patients from Mainland China (n = 66) to that in U. S. Caucasians, Blacks, and Mexican Hispanics and stratify by disease severity and ethnicity. The similar pattern of germline mutation in all ethnic groups studied to date provides additional data compatible with the inference that endogenous processes predominate in germline mutations.
Germline mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for most cases of inherited breast and ovarian cancer . However, the function of the BRCA1 protein has remained elusive. We now show that BRCA1 encodes a 190-kD protein with sequence homology and biochemical analogy to the granin protein family. Interestingly, BRCA2 also includes a motif similar to the granin consensus at the C terminus of the protein. Both BRCA1 and the granins localize to secretory vesicles, are secreted by a regulated pathway, are post-translationally glycosylated and are responsive to hormones. As a regulated secretory protein, BRCA1 appears to function by a mechanism not previously described for tumour suppressor gene products..
Germline mutations in the 3' part of APC exon 15 do not result in truncated proteins and are associated with attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli.
Germline mutations in the ATM gene are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). In our study, we have determined the ATM mutation spectrum in 19 classical A-T patients, including some immigrant populations, as well as 12 of Dutch ethnic origin. Both the protein truncation test (PTT) and the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting (REF) method were used and compared for their detection efficiency, identifying 76% and 60% of the mutations, respectively. Most patients were found to be compound heterozygote. Seventeen mutations were distinct, of which 10 were not reported previously. Mutations are small deletions or point mutations frequently affecting splice sites. Moreover, a 16. 7-kb genomic deletion of the 3 end of the gene, most likely a result of recombination between two LINE elements, was identified. The most frequently found mutation, identified in three unrelated Turkish A-T individuals, was previously described to be a Turkish A-T founder mutation. The presence of a founder mutation among relatively small ethnic population groups in Western Europe could indicate a high carrier frequency in such communities. In patients of Dutch ethnic origin, however, no significant founder effect could be identified. The observed genetic heterogeneity including the relative high percentage of splice-site mutations had no reflection on the phenotype. All patients manifested classical A-T and increased cellular radioresistant DNA synthesis.
Germline mutations in the RB1 gene confer hereditary predisposition to retinoblastoma. We have performed a mutation survey of the RB1 gene in 232 patients with hereditary or non hereditary retinoblastoma. We systematically explored all 27 exons and flanking sequences as well as the promotor. All types of point mutations are represented and are found unequally distributed along the RB1 gene sequence. In the population we studied, exons 3, 8, 18 and 19 are preferentially altered. The range of frequency of detection of germline mutations is about 20%, indicating that other mechanisms of inactivation of RB1 should be involved. The spectrum of mutations presented here should help to improve the clinical management of retinoblastoma and to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to tumorigenesis..

Germline mutations in the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene are associated with abnormal urogenital development in Denys-Drash syndrome.
Germline mutations in the p16 and CDK4 genes have been reported in a subset of melanoma pedigrees, but their prevalence is not well known. We searched for such germline mutations in 48 French melanoma-prone families selected according to two major criteria families with at least three affected members (n = 20) or families with two affected members, one of them affected before the age of 50 (n = 28), and one additional minor criterion. Sixteen different p16 germline mutations were found in 21 families, while one germline mutation, Arg24His, was detected in the CDK4 gene. The frequency of p16 gene mutation in our sample (44%) is among the highest rates yet reported and the CDK4 mutation is the second mutation detected in this gene worldwide. In summary, our results show frequent involvement of the p16 gene in familial melanoma and confirm the role of the CDK4 gene as a melanoma-predisposing gene..
Germline mutations in the thyrotropin receptor gene cause non-autoimmune autosomal dominant hyperthyroidism.
Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, BRCA1, predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancers. Using a combination of affinity- and conventional chromatographic techniques, we have isolated a predominant form of a multiprotein BRCA1-containing complex from human cells displaying chromatin-remodeling activity. Mass spectrometric sequencing of components of this complex indicated that BRCA1 is associated with a SWI/SNF-related complex. We show that BRCA1 can directly interact with the BRG1 subunit of the SWI/SNF complex. Moreover, p53-mediated stimulation of transcription by BRCA1 was completely abrogated by either a dominant-negative mutant of BRG1 or the cancer-causing deletion in exon 11 of BRCA1. These findings reveal a direct function for BRCA1 in transcriptional control through modulation of chromatin structure..

Germline mutations of the BRCA1 gene in breast and ovarian cancer families provide evidence for a genotype-phenotype correlation.
Germline mutations of the Brca1 tumor suppressor gene predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers. To study mechanisms underlying BRCA1-related tumorigenesis, we derived mouse embryonic fibroblast cells carrying a targeted deletion of exon 11 of the Brca1 gene. We show that the mutant cells maintain an intact G1-S cell cycle checkpoint and proliferate poorly. However, a defective G2-M checkpoint in these cells is accompanied by extensive chromosomal abnormalities. Mutant fibroblasts contain multiple, functional centrosomes, which lead to unequal chromosome segregation, abnormal nuclear division, and aneuploidy. These data uncover an essential role of BRCA1 in maintaining genetic stability through the regulation of centrosome duplication and the G2-M checkpoint and provide a molecular basis for the role of BRCA1 in tumorigenesis..
Germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene result in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Patients with FAP typically develop hundreds to thousands of benign colorectal tumors and early-onset colorectal cancer. A subset of germline APC mutations results in an attenuated FAP (AFAP) phenotype, in which patients develop fewer tumors and develop them at an older age. Although a genotype-phenotype correlation between the locations of APC germline mutations and the development of AFAP has been well documented, the mechanism for AFAP has not been well defined. We investigated the mechanism for AFAP in patients carrying a mutant APC allele (APC (AS9)) that has a mutation in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9. APC (AS9) was found to down-regulate beta-catenin-regulated transcription, the major tumor-suppressor function of APC, as did the wild-type APC. Mutation analysis showed that both APC (AS9) and the wild-type APC alleles were somatically mutated in most colorectal tumors from these patients. Functional analysis showed that 4666insA, a common somatic mutation in APC (AS9) in these tumors, did not inactivate the wild-type APC. Our results indicate that carriers of APC (AS9) develop fewer colorectal tumors than do typical patients with FAP because somatic inactivation of both APC alleles is necessary for colorectal tumorigenesis. However, these patients develop colorectal tumors more frequently than does the general population because APC (AS9) is inactivated by mutations that do not inactivate the wild-type APC..
Germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene result in the hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Almost all APC mutations that have been identified are single-nucleotide alterations, small insertions, or small deletions that would truncate the protein product of the gene. No well-characterized intragenic rearrangement of APC has been described, and the prevalence of this type of mutation in FAP patients is not clear. We screened 49 potential FAP families and identified 26 different germline APC mutations in 30 families. Four of these mutations were genomic rearrangements resulting from homologous and nonhomologous recombinations mediated by Alu elements. Two of these four rearrangements were complex, involving deletion and insertion of nucleotides. Of these four rearrangements, one resulted in the deletion of exons 11 and 12 and two others resulted in either complete or partial deletion of exon 14. The fourth rearrangement grossly altered the sequence within intron 14. Although this rearrangement did not affect any coding sequence of APC at the genomic DNA level, it caused inappropriate splicing of exon 14. These rearrangements were initially revealed by analyzing cDNAs and could not have been identified by using mutation detection methods that screened each exon individually. The identification of a rearrangement that did not alter any coding exons yet affected the splicing further underscores the importance of using cDNA for mutation analysis. The identification of four genomic rearrangements among 30 mutations suggests that genomic rearrangements are frequent germline APC mutations..
Germline mutations of the human BRCA2 gene confer susceptibility to breast cancer. Although the function of the BRCA2 protein remains to be determined, murine cells homozygous for BRCA2 inactivation display chromosomal aberrations. We have isolated a 2 MDa BRCA2-containing complex and identified a structural DNA binding component, designated as BRCA2-Associated Factor 35 (BRAF35). BRAF35 contains a nonspecific DNA binding HMG domain and a kinesin-like coiled coil domain. Similar to BRCA2, BRAF35 mRNA expression levels in mouse embryos are highest in proliferating tissues with high mitotic index. Strikingly, nuclear staining revealed a close association of BRAF35/BRCA2 complex with condensed chromatin coincident with histone H3 phosphorylation. Importantly, antibody microinjection experiments suggest a role for BRCA2/BRAF35 complex in modulation of cell cycle progression.

Glomerular epithelial protein 1 (GLEPP1) is a podocyte receptor membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase located on the apical cell membrane of visceral glomerular epithelial cell and foot processes. This receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process. To better understand the utility of GLEPP1 as a marker of glomerular injury, the amount and distribution of GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were examined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RNase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat. Puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN, 20 mg/100g BW). Tissues were analyzed at 0, 5, 7, 11, 21, 45, 80 and 126 days after PAN injection so as to include both the acute phase of proteinuria associated with foot process effacement (days 5-11) and the chronic phase of proteinuria associated with glomerulosclerosis (days 45-126). At day 5, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were reduced from the normal range (265.2 +/- 79.6 x 10(6) moles/glomerulus and 100%) to 15% of normal (41.8 +/- 4.8 x 10(6) moles/glomerulus, p < 0.005). This occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1.8 +/- 1 to 99.0 +/- 61 mg/day (p < 0.001). In contrast, podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time. By day 11, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA had begun to return towards baseline. By day 45-126, at a time when glomerular scarring was present, GLEPP1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of GLEPP1 was not different from normal. We conclude that GLEPP1 expression, unlike podocalyxin, reflects podocyte injury induced by PAN. GLEPP1 expression may be a useful marker of podocyte injury.
Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a cytosolic enzyme encoded by a housekeeping X-linked gene whose main function is to produce NADPH, a key electron donor in the defense against oxidizing agents and in reductive biosynthetic reactions. Inherited G6PD deficiency is associated with either episodic hemolytic anemia (triggered by fava beans or other agents) or life-long hemolytic anemia. We show here that an evolutionary analysis is a key to understanding the biology of a housekeeping gene. From the alignment of the amino acid (aa) sequence of 52 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) species from 42 different organisms, we found a striking correlation between the aa replacements that cause G6PD deficiency in humans and the sequence conservation of G6PD two-thirds of such replacements are in highly and moderately conserved (50-99%) aa; relatively few are in fully conserved aa (where they might be lethal) or in poorly conserved aa, where presumably they simply would not cause G6PD deficiency. This is consistent with the notion that all human mutants have residual enzyme activity and that null mutations are lethal at some stage of development. Comparing the distribution of mutations in a human housekeeping gene with evolutionary conservation is a useful tool for pinpointing amino acid residues important for the stability or the function of the corresponding protein. In view of the current explosive increase in full genome sequencing projects, this tool will become rapidly available for numerous other genes..

Glucose-6-PHOSPHATE dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1.1. 1. 49) deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. Although greater than 400 variants have been described based on clinical and biochemical criteria, little is known about the molecular basis of these G6PD deficiencies. Recently, the gene that encodes human G6PD has been cloned and sequenced, which enables us to examine directly the heterogeneity of G6PD at the DNA level. During the past 10 years, we examined the G6PD activity in 21, 271 newborn Chinese infants (11, 400 males and 9, 871 females) and identified 314 (2. 8%) males and 246 (2. 5%) females having low G6PD activity. The G6PD gene from 10 randomly selected affected individuals and their relatives was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified, subcloned, and sequenced. Our results indicate that at least four types of mutation are responsible for the G6PD polymorphism in Taiwan. The first type of mutation (487 G----A) was found in an affected Chinese with a G to A change at nucleotide 487, which results in a (163) Gly to Ser substitution. The second type of mutation (493 A----G) is a novel mutation that has not been reported in any other ethnic group and was identified in two affected Chinese. This mutation causes an A to G change at nucleotide position 493, producing an (165) Asn to Asp substitution. Interestingly, the 487 G----A and 493 A----G mutations create Alu I and Ava II recognition sites, respectively, which enabled us to rapidly detect these two mutations by PCR/restriction enzyme (RE) digestion method. The third mutation (1376 G----T) was found in four affected Chinese. This mutation causes a G to T change at nucleotide position 1376 that results in an (459) Arg to Leu substitution. The 1376 G----T mutation seems to be the dominant allele that causes G6PD deficiency in Taiwan. Finally, two affected Chinese were identified as having the fourth mutation (1388 G----A). This mutation causes a G to A change at nucleotide 1388 that produces an (463) Arg to His substitution. Our studies provide the direct proof of the genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency in the Chinese populations of Taiwan and the PCR/RE digestion method is suitable for simultaneous detection of the 487 G----A and 493 A----G mutations.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency appears to be fairly common in Mexico. We have now examined the DNA of three previously reported electrophoretically fast Mexican G6PD variants, -G6PD Distrito Federal, G6PD Tepic, and G6PD Castilla. All three of these variants, believed on the basis of biochemical characterization and population origin to be unique, have the G----A transition at nucleotide 202 and the A----G transition at nucleotide 376, mutations that we now recognize to be characteristic of G6PD A-. Two other Mexican males with G6PD deficiency were found to have the same mutation. All five have the (NlaIII/FokI/PvuII/PstI) haplotype characteristic of G6PD A -in Africa. Since the PvuII + genotype seems to be rare in Europe, we conclude that all of these G6PD A - genes had their ancient origin in Africa, although in many of the Mexican patients with G6PD A -202A/376G the gene may have been imported more recently from Spain, where this variant, formerly known as G6PD Betica, is also prevalent..
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in RBCs was found significantly more frequently in 210 male cataractous patients than in 672 control subjects of Sardinian origin. The frequency of the deficiency was increasingly higher in presenile cataracts. In the G6PD-deficient group, the incidence of cortical and total cataracts was also increased. It is suggested that decrease of the G6PD activity in the lens, which accompanies its deficiency in the erythrocyte, might play a role in the cataracto-genesis of these patients. Moreover, G6PD deficiency should be added to other conditions, such as the galactosemic states and riboflavin deficiency, where cataracts represent a sensitive indicator of metabolic abnormalities of the RBC..
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was found in 3. 2% of the male population living in the urban area of Algiers. The deficient subjects originated from multiple geographic regions of Northern Algeria, with prevalence of individuals of Berber-Kabyle origin. Red blood cell G6PD was partially purified and characterized in deficient males from 17 families, and six different variants were found. Among them, only one, the Gd (-) Kabyle variant, had been previously described. It was detected in nine families. The other five variants were new Gd (-) Laghouat (four cases), Gd (-) Blida (one case), Gd (-) Thenia (one case), Gd (-) Titteri (one case), and Gd (-) Alger (two brothers). Strikingly, the common Mediterranean variant was not found. G6PD deficiency is heterogeneous in northern Algeria where autochtonous variants seem to prevail. The Kabyle variant may be common in this country.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the most common enzymopathy of humans, affects over 400 million people. The geographical correlation of its distribution with the historical endemicity of malaria suggests that this disorder has risen in frequency through natural selection by malaria. However, attempts to confirm that G6PD deficiency is protective in case-control studies of malaria have yielded conflicting results. Hence, for this X-linked disorder, it is unclear whether both male hemizygotes and female heterozygotes are protected or, as frequently suggested, only females. Furthermore, how much protection may be afforded is unknown. Here we report that, in two large case-control studies of over 2, 000 African children, the common African form of G6PD deficiency (G6PD A-) is associated with a 46-58% reduction in risk of severe malaria for both female heterozygotes and male hemizygotes. A mathematical model incorporating the measured selective advantage against malaria suggests that a counterbalancing selective disadvantage, associated with this enzyme deficiency, has retarded its rise in frequency in malaria-endemic regions. Although G6PD deficiency is now regarded as a generally benign disorder, in earlier environmental conditions it could have been significantly disadvantageous..
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) has been analyzed by gel electrophoresis and by quantitative assay in an unselected sample of 1524 schoolboys from the province of Matera (Lucania) in southern Italy. We have identified 43 subjects with a G6PD variant. Of these, 31 had severe G6PD deficiency, nine had mild to moderate deficiency, and three had a non-deficient electrophoretic variant. The overall rate of G6PD deficiency was 2. 6%. The frequency of G6PD deficiency, ranging from 7. 2% on the Ionian Coast to zero on the eastern side of the Lucanian Apennines, appears to be inversely related to the distance of each town examined from the Ionian Coast, suggesting that this geographic distribution may reflect, at least in part, gene flow from Greek settlers. Biochemical characterization has shown that most of the G6PD deficiency in this population is accounted for by G6PD Mediterranean. In addition, we have found several examples of two other known polymorphic variants (G6PD Cagliari and G6PD A-); three new polymorphic variants, G6PD Metaponto (class III), G6PD Montalbano (class III), and G6PD Pisticci (class IV); and two sporadic variants, G6PD Tursi (class III) and G6PD Ferrandina (class II). These data provide further evidence for the marked genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency within a relatively narrow geographic area and they prove the presence in the Italian peninsula of a gene (GdA-) regarded as characteristically African.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD); EC 1. 1. 1. 49 from thirty-six unrelated Spanish males was partially purified from blood, and the variants were characterized biochemically and electrophoretically according to the methods recommended by the world Health Organization. Subjects were from multiple geographic regions within Spain, and all suffered from hemolytic anemia, either acute (34 cases) or chronic nonspherocytic (2 cases). Almost all the variants studied presented residual erythrocyte G6PD activity ranging from 0 to 10% of normal, and five different mutants were responsible for the deficient phenotype. Three variants were similar to others previously described G6PD Mediterranean (11 cases), G6PD Athens-like (3 cases), and G6PD Union (2 cases). The remaining variants were different from the numerous variants already reported and have been considered as new mutants. Provisionally they are called G6PD Betica (19 cases) and G6PD Menorca (1 case). The present study constitutes the first attempt to characterize the deficient G6PD variants found in Spain and supplies new data on the relationship between molecular characteristics of deficient variants and their clinical manifestations. The most important findings can be summarized as follows (1) The Spanish population is characterized by an important heterogeneity in G6PD deficiency. (2) Although G6PD Mediterranean is very frequent, it presents a relatively high degree of polymorphism. (3) Favism has been observed associated with all kinds of variants described here. (4) G6PD Betica, which is the most frequent variant found in subjects of Southern Spanish origin, has been observed associated with favism in all cases except one.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; E. C. 1. 1. 1. 49) deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy; more than 300 different biochemical variants of the enzyme have been described. In many parts of the world the Mediterranean type of G6PD deficiency is prevalent. However, G6PD Mediterranean has come to be regarded as a generic term applied to similar G6PD mutations thought, however, to represent a somewhat heterogeneous group. A C----T mutation at nucleotide 563 of G6PD Mediterranean has been identified by Vulliamy et al., and the same mutation has been found by De Vita et al. in G6PD Mediterranean, G6PD Sassari, and G6PD Cagliari. The latter subjects had an additional mutation, at nucleotide 1311, that did not produce a coding change. We have examined genomic DNA of five patients--four of Spanish origin and one of Jewish origin--having enzymatically documented G6PD Mediterranean. All had both the mutation at nucleotide 563 and that at nucleotide 1311. A sixth sample, resembling G6PD Mediterranean kinetically but with a slightly rapid electrophoretic mobility, was designated G6PD Andalus and was found to have a different mutation, a G----A transition at nucleotide 1361, producing an arginine-to-histidine substitution. These studies suggest that G6PD Mediterranean is, after all, relatively homogeneous.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1. 1. 1. 49) -deficient red blood cells from male hemizygotes and female heterozygotes from the island of Sardinia were studied for their ability to support growth in vitro of the malaria-causing organism Plasmodium falciparum. Parasite growth was approximately one-third of normal in both hemi- and heterozygotes for G6PD deficiency. In Sardinians with the beta 0-thalassemia trait, parasite growth was normal except when G6PD deficiency occurred together with the thalassemia trait. The data support the hypothesis that G6PD deficiency may confer a selective advantage in a malarious area; the female heterozygote may be at a particular advantage because resistance to malaria equals that of male hemizygotes, but the risk of fatal hemolysis may be less. However, more female heterozygotes must be studied to confirm this hypothesis. No protective effect of beta 0-thalassemia trait could be demonstrated in vitro.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1. 1. 1. 49) deficiency is a common genetic abnormality affecting an estimated 400 million people worldwide. Clinical and biochemical analyses have identified many variants exhibiting a range of phenotypes, which have been well characterized from the hematological point of view. However, until now, their precise molecular basis has remained unknown. We have cloned and sequenced seven mutant G6PD alleles. In the nondeficient polymorphic African variant G6PD A we have found a single point mutation. The other six mutants investigated were all associated with enzyme deficiency. In one of the commonest, G6PD Mediterranean, which is associated with favism among other clinical manifestations, a single amino acid replacement was found (serine----phenylalanine) it must be responsible for the decreased stability and the reduced catalytic efficiency of this enzyme. Single point mutations were also found in G6PD Metaponto (Southern Italy) and in G6PD Ilesha (Nigeria), which are asymptomatic, and in G6PD Chatham, which was observed in an Indian boy with neonatal jaundice. In G6PD " Matera, " which is now known to be the same as G6PD A-, two separate point mutations were found, one of which is the same as in G6PD A. In G6PD Santiago, a de novo mutation (glycine----arginine) is associated with severe chronic hemolytic anemia. The mutations observed show a striking predominance of C----T transitions, with CG doublets involved in four of seven cases. Thus, diverse point mutations may account largely for the phenotypic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency.

Glucose/galactose malabsorption (GGM) is an autosomal recessive disease manifesting within the first weeks of life and characterized by a selective failure to absorb dietary glucose and galactose from the intestine. The consequent severe diarrhoea and dehydration are usually fatal unless these sugars are eliminated from the diet. Intestinal biopsies of GGM patients have revealed a specific defect in Na (+) -dependent absorption of glucose in the brush border. Normal glucose absorption is mediated by the Na +/glucose cotransporter in the brush border membrane of the intestinal epithelium. Cellular influx is driven by the transmembrane Na + electrochemical potential gradient; thereafter the sugar moves to the blood across the basolateral membrane via the facilitated glucose carrier. We have previously cloned and sequenced a Na +/glucose cotransporter from normal human ileum and shown that this gene, SGLT1, resides on the distal q arm of chromosome 22. We have now amplified SGLT1 complementary DNA and genomic DNA from members of a family affected with GGM by the polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the amplified products has revealed a single missense mutation in SGLT1 which cosegregates with the GGM phenotype and results in a complete loss of Na (+) -dependent glucose transport in Xenopus oocytes injected with this complementary RNA..

Glycerol as a correlate of impaired glucose tolerance: dissection of a complex system by use of a simple genetic trait.
Glycerol kinase (GK) represents the primary entry of glycerol into glucose and triglyceride metabolism. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and hypertriglyceridemia are associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The relationship between glycerol and the risk of IGT, however, is poorly understood. We therefore undertook the study of fasting plasma glycerol levels in a cohort of 1, 056 unrelated men and women of French-Canadian descent. Family screening in the initial cohort identified 18 men from five families with severe hyperglycerolemia (values above 2. 0 mmol/liter) and demonstrated an X-linked pattern of inheritance. Linkage analysis of the data from 12 microsatellite markers surrounding the Xp21. 3 GK gene resulted in a peak LOD score of 3. 46, centered around marker DXS8039. In addition, since all of the families originated in a population with a proven founder effect-the Saguenay Lac-St. -Jean region of Quebec-a common disease haplotype was sought. Indeed, a six-marker haplotype extending over a region of 5. 5 cM was observed in all families. Resequencing of the GK gene in family members led to the discovery of a N288D missense mutation in exon 10, which resulted in the substitution of a highly conserved asparagine residue by a negatively charged aspartic acid.
Glyceryl trinitrate induces attacks of migraine without aura in sufferers of migraine with aura.
Glycogenin is a self-glucosylating protein involved in the initiation phase of glycogen biosynthesis. A single mammalian gene had been reported to account for glycogen biogenesis in liver and muscle, the two major repositories of glycogen. We describe the characterization of novel forms of glycogenin, designated glycogenin-2 (GN-2), encoded by a second gene that is expressed preferentially in certain tissues, including liver, heart, and pancreas. Cloning of cDNAs encoding glycogenin-2 indicated the existence of multiple species, including three liver forms (GN-2alpha, GN-2beta, and GN-2gamma) generated in part by alternative splicing. Overall, GN-2 has 40-45% identity to muscle glycogenin but is 72% identical over a 200-residue segment thought to contain the catalytic domain. GN-2 expressed in Escherichia coli or COS cells is active in self-glucosylation assays, and self-glucosylated GN-2 can be elongated by skeletal muscle glycogen synthase. Antibodies raised against GN-2 produced in E. coli recognized proteins of Mr approximately 66,000 present in extracts of rat liver and in cultured H4IIEC3 hepatoma cells. In H4IIEC3 cells, most of the GN-2 was present as a free protein but some was covalently associated with glycogen fractions and was only released by treatment with alpha-amylase. H4IIEC3 cells also expressed the muscle form of glycogenin (glycogenin-1), which was attached to a chromatographically separable glycogen fraction.

Glycoprotein (GP)Ib-IX-V is one of the major transmembrane complexes present on the platelet surface. Its extracellular domain binds von Willebrand factor (vWF) and thrombin, while its intracellular domain associates tightly with the cytoskeleton through the actin-binding protein (ABP)-280, also known as filamin. In the present study, a full-length cDNA coding for a human ABP homologue has been cloned and sequenced. This protein was identified by the yeast two-hybrid screening procedure via its interaction with the intracellular domain of GPIbalpha. Initially, a 1.3-kb partial cDNA was isolated from a megakaryocyte-like cell line (K562) cDNA library followed by a full-length cDNA of 9.4 kb that was identified in a human placenta library. The full-length cDNA encoded a protein of 2,578 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 276 kD (ABP-276). The amino terminal 248 amino acids contained an apparent actin binding domain followed by 24 tandem repeats each containing about 96 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the protein shared a high degree of homology with human endothelial ABP-280 (70% identity) and chicken filamin (83% identity). However, the 32 amino acid Hinge I region in ABP-280 that contains a calpain cleavage site conferring flexibility on the molecule, was absent in the homologue. An isoform containing a 24 amino acid insertion with a unique sequence at the missing Hinge I region was also identified (ABP-278). This isoform resulted from alternative RNA splicing. ABP-276 and/or ABP-278 were present in all tissues examined, but the relative amount varied in that some tissue contained both forms, while other tissue contained predominately one or the other.

Golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a spontaneous, X-linked, progressively fatal disease of dogs and is also a homologue of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Two-thirds of DMD patients carry detectable deletions in their dystrophin gene. The defect underlying the remaining one-third of DMD patients is undetermined. Analysis of the canine dystrophin gene in normal and GRMD dogs has failed to demonstrate any detectable loss of exons. Here, we have demonstrated a RNA processing error in GRMD that results from a single base change in the 3 consensus splice site of intron 6. The seventh exon is then skipped, which predicts a termination of the dystrophin reading frame within its N-terminal domain in exon 8. This is the first example of dystrophin deficiency caused by a splice-site mutation..

Grape seed extract, primarily a mixture of proanthocyanidins, has been shown to modulate a wide-range of biological, pharmacological and toxicological effects which are mainly cytoprotective. This study assessed the ability of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) to prevent acetaminophen (AAP)-induced nephrotoxicity, amiodarone (AMI)-induced lung toxicity, and doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. Experimental design consisted of four groups: control (vehicle alone), GSPE alone, drug alone and GSPE+drug. For the cytoprotection study, animals were orally gavaged 100 mg/Kg GSPE for 7-10 days followed by i.p. injections of organ specific three drugs (AAP: 500 mg/Kg for 24 h; AMI: 50 mg/Kg/day for four days; DOX: 20 mg/Kg for 48 h). Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry (ALT, BUN and CPK), and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA (both endonuclease-dependent and independent) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and/or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues. Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP, AMI and DOX, provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes (ALT, BUN and CPK), and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation. Histopathological examination of kidney, heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of GSPE preexposure than in its presence. GSPE+drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery. Additionally, histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, all the drugs, such as, AAP, AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE. Since AAP, AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo, the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and/or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals. In addition, its' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute, which played a role in the chemoprevention process. Additionally, this may have been the first report on AMI-induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue. Taken together, these events undoubtedly establish GSPE's abundant bioavailability, and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo.
Groups of male and female inbred Leeds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0.5% or 1.0% paracetamol by weight for up to 18 months. At the 1.0% dosage level, 20% of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver, a statistically significant incidence. These rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration, the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rats. Papillomas of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all paracetamol-treated groups, and three rats bore bladder carcinomas. However, significant yields of bladder tumours were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage males. Additionally, 20 to 25% of paracetamol-treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium, which was not coincident with the presence of bladder calculi. A low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following paracetamol feeding. An electron microscope study of the livers of paracetamol-treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known hepatocarcinogens.

Gustatory hyperhidrosis is facial sweating usually associated with the eating of hot spicy food or even smelling this food. Current options of treatment include oral anticholinergic drugs, the topical application of anticholinergics or aluminum chloride, and the injection of botulinum toxin. Thirteen patients have been treated to date with 1.5% or 2% topical glycopyrrolate. All patients had gustatory hyperhidrosis, which interfered with their social activities, after transthroacic endoscopic sympathectomy, and which was associated with compensatory focal hyperhidrosis. After applying topical glycopyrrolate, the subjective effect was excellent (no sweating after eating hot spicy food) in 10 patients (77%), and fair (clearly reduced sweating) in 3 patients (23%). All had reported incidents of being very embarrassed whilst eating hot spicy foods. Adverse effects included a mildly dry mouth and a sore throat in 2 patients (2% glycopyrrolate), a light headache in 1 patient (1.5% glycopyrrolate). The topical application of a glycopyrrolate pad appeared to be safe, efficacious, well tolerated, and a convenient method of treatment for moderate to severe symptoms of gustatory hyperhidrosis in post transthoracic endoscopic sympathectomy or sympathicotomy patients, with few side effects.
HCC-1, a novel chemokine from human plasma.
HFE is an MHC-related protein that is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary hemochromatosis. HFE binds to transferrin receptor (TfR) and reduces its affinity for iron-loaded transferrin, implicating HFE in iron metabolism. The 2. 6 A crystal structure of HFE reveals the locations of hemochromatosis mutations and a patch of histidines that could be involved in pH-dependent interactions. We also demonstrate that soluble TfR and HFE bind tightly at the basic pH of the cell surface, but not at the acidic pH of intracellular vesicles. TfR HFE stoichiometry (2 1) differs from TfR transferrin stoichiometry (2 2), implying a different mode of binding for HFE and transferrin to TfR, consistent with our demonstration that HFE, transferrin, and TfR form a ternary complex.
HFE is the protein product of the gene mutated in the autosomal recessive disease hereditary hemochromatosis (Feder, J. N., Gnirke, A., Thomas, W., Tsuchihashi, Z., Ruddy, D. A., Basava, A., Dormishian, F., Domingo, R. J., Ellis, M. C., Fullan, A., Hinton, L. M., Jones, N. L., Kimmel, B. E., Kronmal, G. S., Lauer, P., Lee, V. K., Loeb, D. B., Mapa, F. A., McClelland, E., Meyer, N. C., Mintier, G. A., Moeller, N., Moore, T., Morikang, E., Prasss, C. E ., Quintana, L., Starnes, S. M ., Schatzman, R. C ., Brunke, K. J ., Drayna, D. T., Risch, N. J ., Bacon, B. R ., and Wolff, R. R . (1996) Nat. Genet. 13, 399-408). At the cell surface, HFE complexes with transferrin receptor (TfR), increasing the dissociation constant of transferrin (Tf) for its receptor 10-fold (Gross, C. N ., Irrinki, A., Feder, J. N ., and Enns, C. A . (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 22068-22074; Feder, J. N., Penny, D. M., Irrinki, A., Lee, V. K., Lebron, J. A., Watson, N., Tsuchihashi, Z., Sigal, E., Bjorkman, P. J., and Schatzman, R. C. (1998) Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci. U S A 95, 1472-1477). HFE does not remain at the cell surface, but traffics with TfR to Tf-positive internal compartments (Gross et al., 1998). Using a HeLa cell line in which the expression of HFE is controlled by tetracycline, we show that the expression of HFE reduces 55Fe uptake from Tf by 33% but does not affect the endocytic or exocytic rates of TfR cycling. Therefore, HFE appears to reduce cellular acquisition of iron from Tf within endocytic compartments. HFE specifically reduces iron uptake from Tf, as non-Tf-mediated iron uptake from Fe-nitrilotriacetic acid is not altered. These results explain the decreased ferritin levels seen in our HeLa cell system and demonstrate the specific control of HFE over the Tf-mediated pathway of iron uptake. These results also have implications for the understanding of cellular iron homeostasis in organs such as the liver, pancreas, heart, and spleen that are iron loaded in hereditary hemochromatotic individuals lacking functional HFE.

Haematological adverse reactions associated with fatal outcome are rare during treatment with ciprofloxacin. A 30-year old Caucasian man reported with abdominal pain and jaundice after 3-day administration of oral ciprofloxacin for a suspect of urinary tract infection. Clinical evaluations suggested an initial diagnosis of severe thrombocytopenia and haemolysis. The patient progressively developed petechiae and purpura on thorax and lower limbs. Despite pharmacological and supportive interventions, laboratory parameters worsened and the patient died 17 hours after admission. An accurate autopsy revealed most organs with diffuse petechial haemorrhages. No signs of bone marrow depression were found. No thrombi or signs of microangiopathies were observed in arterial vessels. Blood and urine cultures did not show any bacterial growth. This case report shows that ciprofloxacin may precipitate life-threatening thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia, even in the early phases of treatment and without apparent previous exposures.

Hemochromatosis, the inherited disorder of iron metabolism, leads, if untreated, to progressive iron overload and premature death. The hemochromatosis gene, HFE, recently has been identified, and characterization of this gene has shown that it contains two mutations that result in amino acid substitutions-cDNA nucleotides 845 G-- > A (C282Y) and 187 C-- > G (H63D). Although hemochromatosis is common in Caucasians, affecting > = 1/300 individuals of northern European origin, it has not been recognized in other populations. The present study used PCR and restriction-enzyme digestion to analyze the frequency of the 845 G-- > A and 187 C-- > G mutations in HLA-typed samples from non-Caucasian populations, comprising Australian Aboriginal, Chinese, and Pacific Islanders. Results showed that the 845 G-- > A mutation was present in these populations (allele frequency 0. 32%), and, furthermore, it was always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that 845 G-- > A may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture. 187 C-- > G was present at an allele frequency of 2. 68% in the two populations analyzed (Australian Aboriginal and Chinese). In the Australian Aboriginal samples, 187 C-- > G was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that it was introduced by recent admixture. In the Chinese samples analyzed, 187 C-- > G was present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes, showing this mutation to be widespread and likely to predate the more genetically restricted 845 G-- > A mutation.
Hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of dronedarone and amiodarone in animals with a healed myocardial infarction.
Hemodynamic effects and histamine release by bolus injection of 0.35 mg/kg of d-tubocurarine were studied in 24 patients. H1- and H2-histamine antagonists or placebo were given before dosing with d-tubocurarine in a randomized double-blind fashion to four groups: group 1--placebo; group 2--cimetidine, 4 mg/kg, plus placebo; group 3--chlorpheniramine, 0.1 mg/kg, plus placebo; and group 4--cimetidine plus chlorpheniramine. Histamine release occurred in most patients, the highest level 2 minutes after d-tubocurarine dosing. Group 1 had a moderate negative correlation between plasma histamine change and systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.58; P less than 0.05) not present in group 4. Prior dosing with antagonists partially prevented the fall in systemic vascular resistance. These data demonstrate that the hemodynamic changes associated with d-tubocurarine dosing are only partially explained by histamine release. Thus prior dosing with H1- and H2-antagonists provides only partial protection.

Hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with ingestion of quinine.
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome following quinine ingestion is a newly described phenomenon, with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature. We describe a 5th case. The reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of quinine. Treatment has included use of plasma exchange, prednisone, aspirin, and dipyridamole. The patients have all regained some degree of renal function. However, it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the improvement. Quinine-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome probably occurs more often than is recognized. It is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further quinine exposure, since the reaction seems to be recurrent.
Hemorrhagic cystitis complicating bone marrow transplantation.
Hemorrhagic cystitis is a major potential toxicity of ifosfamide that can be prevented by administering mesna along with the cytotoxic agent. Mesna is generally administered by the intravenous route, although experience with oral delivery of the drug has increased. The continuous subcutaneous administration of mesna has the advantage of not requiring intravenous access. In addition, subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary mesna concentrations, such as in a patient taking oral mesna who experiences severe ifosfamide-induced emesis and is unable to absorb the drug. Limited clinical experience with continuous subcutaneous mesna administration suggests it is a safe, practical, and economic method of drug delivery that permits ifosfamide to be administered successfully in the outpatient setting.
Hemorrhagic cystitis is a potentially serious complication of high-dose cyclophosphamide therapy administered before bone marrow transplantation. As standard practice at our institution, patients who are scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant are treated prophylactically with forced hydration and bladder irrigation. In an attempt to obviate the inconvenience of bladder irrigation, we conducted a feasibility trial of uroprophylaxis with mesna, which neutralizes the hepatic metabolite of cyclophosphamide that causes hemorrhagic cystitis. Of 97 patients who received standard prophylaxis, 4 had symptomatic hemorrhagic cystitis. In contrast, two of four consecutive patients who received mesna uroprophylaxis before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had severe hemorrhagic cystitis for at least 2 weeks. Because of this suboptimal result, we resumed the use of bladder irrigation and forced hydration to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis.
Heparan sulphate-associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane were studied in rats 8 months after induction of diabetes by streptozotocin and in age- adn sex-matched control rats, employing the cationic dye cuprolinic blue. Morphometric analysis at the ultrastructural level was performed using a computerized image processor. The heparan sulphate specificity of the cuprolinic blue staining was demonstrated by glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes, showing that pretreatment of the sections with heparitinase abolished all staining, whereas chondroitinase ABC had no effect. The majority of anionic sites (74% in diabetic and 81% in control rats) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane. A minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna, and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane (p<0.001 and p<0.01 for diabetic and control rats, respectively). Diabetic rats progressively developed albuminuria reaching 40.3 (32.2-62.0) mg/24 h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals (0.8 (0.2-0.9) mg/24 h, p<0.002). At the same time, the number of heparan sulphate anionic sites and the total anionic site surface (number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19% (p<0.021) and by 26% (p<0.02), respectively. Number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane (lamina densa and lamina rara interna) were not significantly changed. We conclude that in streptozotocin-diabetic rats with an increased urinary albumin excretion, a reduced heparan sulphate charge barrier/density is found at the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane.
Heparin is a commonly implemented anticoagulant used to treat critically ill patients. Recently, a number of commercial lots of heparin products were found to be contaminated with an oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS) derivative that could elicit a hypotensive response in pigs following a single high-dose infusion. Using both contaminated heparin products and the synthetically produced derivative, we showed that the OSCS produces dose-dependent hypotension in pigs. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for this contaminant appears to be approximately 1mg/kg, corresponding to a contamination level of approximately 3%. We also demonstrated that OSCS can be identified in heparin products using a simple, inexpensive, commercially available heparin enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit that has a limit of detection of approximately 0.1%, well below the NOEL. This kit may provide a useful method to test heparin products for contamination with oversulfated GAG derivatives.
Heparin, first used to prevent the clotting of blood in vitro, has been clinically used to treat thrombosis for more than 50 years. Although several new anticoagulant drugs are in development, heparin remains the anticoagulant of choice to treat acute thrombotic episodes. The clinical effects of heparin are meritorious, but side effects do exist. Bleeding is the primary untoward effect of heparin. Major bleeding is of primary concern in patients receiving heparin therapy. However, additional important untoward effects of heparin therapy include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, heparin-associated osteoporosis, eosinophilia, skin reactions, allergic reactions other than thrombocytopenia, alopecia, transaminasemia, hyperkalemia, hypoaldosteronism, and priapism. These side effects are relatively rare in a given individual, but given the extremely widespread use of heparin, some are quite common, particularly HITT and osteoporosis. Although reasonable incidences of many of these side effects can be "softly" deduced from current reports dealing with unfractionated heparin, at present the incidences of these side effects with newer low molecular weight heparins appear to be much less common. However, only longer experience will more clearly define the incidence of each side effect with low molecular weight preparations.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) remains under-recognized despite its potentially devastating outcomes. It begins when heparin exposure stimulates the formation of heparin-platelet factor 4 antibodies, which in turn triggers the release of procoagulant platelet particles. Thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that follow comprise the 2 hallmark traits of HIT, with the former largely responsible for significant vascular complications. The prevalence of HIT varies among several subgroups, with greater incidence in surgical as compared with medical populations. HIT must be acknowledged for its intense predilection for thrombosis and suspected whenever thrombosis occurs after heparin exposure. Early recognition that incorporates the clinical and serologic clues is paramount to timely institution of treatment, as its delay may result in catastrophic outcomes. The treatment of HIT mandates an immediate cessation of all heparin exposure and the institution of an antithrombotic therapy, most commonly using a direct thrombin inhibitor. Current "diagnostic" tests, which primarily include functional and antigenic assays, have more of a confirmatory than diagnostic role in the management of HIT. Special attention must be paid to cardiac patients who are often exposed to heparin multiple times during their course of treatment. Direct thrombin inhibitors are appropriate, evidence-based alternatives to heparin in patients with a history of HIT, who need to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. As heparin remains one of the most frequently used medications today with potential for HIT with every heparin exposure, a close vigilance of platelet counts must be practiced whenever heparin is initiated.

Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and immune serum globulin (ISG) were examined in a randomized, double-blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing type B hepatitis after needle-stick exposure to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG)-positive donors. Clinical hepatitis developed in 1.4% of HBIG and in 5.9% of ISG recipients (P = 0.016), and seroconversion (anti-HBs) occurred in 5.6% and 20.7% of them respectively (P less than 0.001). Mild and transient side-effects were noted in 3.0% of ISG and in 3.2% of HBIG recipients. Available donor sera were examined for DNA polymerase (DNAP) and e antigen and antibody (HBeAg; anti-HBE). Both DNAP and HBeAg showed a highly statistically significant correlation with the infectivity of HBsAg-positive donors. Hepatitis B immune globulin remained significantly superior to ISG in preventing type B hepatitis even when the analysis was confined to these two high-risk subgroups. The efficacy of ISG in preventing type B hepatitis cannot be ascertained because a true placebo group was not included.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which causes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, remains a major health problem in Asian countries. Recent development of vaccine for prevention is reported to be successful in reducing the size of chronically infected carriers, although the standard medical therapies have not been established up to now. In this report, we encountered a patient with decompensated HBV-related cirrhosis who exhibited the dramatic improvements after antiviral therapy. The patient was a 50-year-old woman. Previous conventional medical treatments were not effective for this patient, thus this patient had been referred to our hospital. However, the administration of lamivudine, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, for 23 months dramatically improved her liver severity. During this period, no drug resistant mutant HBV emerged, and the serum HBV-DNA level was continuously suppressed. These virological responses were also maintained even after the antiviral therapy was discontinued. Moreover, both hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen were observed to have disappeared in this patient. The administration of lamivudine to patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, like our present case, should be considered as an initial medical therapeutic option, especially in countries where liver transplantation is not reliably available.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Cancer patients who are chronic carriers of HBV have a higher hepatic complication rate while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT) and this has mainly been attributed to HBV reactivation. In this study, cancer patients who have solid and hematological malignancies with chronic HBV infection received the antiviral agent lamivudine prior and during CT compared with historical control group who did not receive lamivudine. The objectives were to assess the efficacy of lamivudine in reducing the incidence of HBV reactivation, and diminishing morbidity and mortality during CT. Two groups were compared in this study. The prophylactic lamivudin group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic lamivudine treatment. The historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent CT without prophylactic lamivudine. They were followed up during and for 8 weeks after CT. The outcomes were compared for both groups. Of our control group (n= 50), 21 patients (42%) were established hepatitis. Twelve (24%) of them were evaluated as severe hepatitis. In the prophylactic lamivudine group severe hepatitis were observed only in 1 patient (2.7%) of 37 patients (p < 0.006). Comparison of the mean ALT values revealed significantly higher mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values in the control group than the prophylactic lamivudine group; 154:64 (p < 0.32). Our study suggests that prophylactic lamivudine significantly decreases the incidence of HBV reactivation and overall morbidity in cancer patients during and after immunosuppressive therapy. Further studies are needed to determine the most appropriate nucleoside or nucleotide analogue for antiviral prophylaxis during CT and the optimal duration of administration after completion of CT.
Hepatitis and renal tubular acidosis after anesthesia with methoxyflurane.
Hepatoblastoma is a rare malignant tumor of the liver that occurs in children at an average age of 2 to 3 years. Epidemiologic studies have shown an increased frequency of this tumor type in families affected by adenomatous polyposis coli. In addition to the epidemiologic data, molecular genetic studies suggest that inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor may be involved in hepatoblastoma tumorigenesis. A major function of APC is the downregulation of beta-catenin, a transcription-activating protein with oncogenic potential. In an ongoing immunohistochemical study of beta-catenin expression in sporadic cases of tumor types that are associated with adenomatous polyposis coli, we observed increased beta-catenin levels in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei of three investigated hepatoblastomas. Sequencing of exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) revealed an activating mutation in one of the tumor samples. Our data indicate for the first time that beta-catenin accumulation may play a role in the development of hepatoblastoma and that activating mutations of the beta-catenin gene may substitute biallelic APC inactivation in this tumor type.

Hepatoblastoma is a rare neoplasm of infants and children only recently documented in association with hereditary adenomatous polyposis of the colon [Kingston et al., 1983]. We report four children with hepatoblastoma from four unrelated families with Gardner syndrome (GS). One child, now 19 years old, survived after a resection of a hepatoblastoma in infancy and recently was found to have GS. He has an associated odontoma and pigmented ocular fundus lesions, both of which have been shown to be clinical markers of GS. Many individuals in these four GS families, both affected and at risk, have osteomatous jaw lesions and pigmented ocular fundus lesions. A search for colonic polyps should be made in families of infants and children with hepatoblastoma. If the child survives, he or she should be monitored for the later appearance of colonic polyps. The finding of jaw lesions and/or pigmented ocular fundus lesions in relatives at risk are indications of the possible presence of the GS gene.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activator is a serine protease responsible for proteolytic activation of HGF in response to tissue injury and thus plays an important role in the regulation of biological functions of HGF in regenerating tissue. We previously purified an inhibitor of HGF activator (HGF activator inhibitor type 1, HAI-1) from the conditioned medium of a human stomach carcinoma cell line MKN45 and cloned its cDNA. HAI-1 is a novel member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. In the present study, we purified a second type of HGF activator inhibitor (HAI-2) from the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells and molecularly cloned its cDNA. The cDNA sequence revealed that HAI-2 is derived from a precursor protein of 252 amino acids and contains two Kunitz domains, indicating that HAI-2 is also a member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. The primary translation product of HAI-2 has a hydrophobic sequence in the COOH-terminal region, suggesting that, like HAI-1, HAI-2 is produced in a membrane-associated form and secreted in a proteolytically truncated form. Because HAI-2 and HAI-1 are potent inhibitors specific for HGF activator, they may be involved in regulation of proteolytic activation of HGF in injured tissues.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor-6: associations between genetic variability and type II diabetes and between genetic variability and estimates of insulin secretion.
Hepatocyte tight junctions (TJs), the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces, play a key role in bile formation. Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in cholestasis, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze-fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information. Recently, several TJ-associated proteins like ZO-1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized. Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability. We used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol (EE) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation (BDL) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage. Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double-immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO-1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope. In control rats, immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion. In contrast, 7H6 and ZO-1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL. Immunostaining for 7H6, not ZO-1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL. After EE treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule. This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and EE treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability.

Hereditary coproporphyria (HC) is an acute hepatic porphyria with autosomal dominant inheritance caused by deficient activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO). Clinical manifestations of the disease are characterized by acute attacks of neurological dysfunction often precipitated by drugs, fasting, cyclical hormonal changes, or infectious diseases. Skin photosensitivity may also be present. The seven exons, the exon/intron boundaries and part of 3 noncoding sequence of the CPO gene were systematically analyzed by an exon-by-exon denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) strategy followed by direct sequencing in seven unrelated heterozygous HC patients from France, Holland, and Czech Republic. Seven novel mutations and two new polymorphisms were detected. Among these mutations two are missense (G197W, W427R), two are nonsense (Q306X, Q385X), two are small deletions (662de14bp; 1168del3bp removing a glycine at position 390), and one is a splicing mutation (IVS1-15c-- > g) which creates a new acceptor splice site. The pathological significance of the point mutations G197W, W427R, and the in-frame deletion 390delGly were assessed by their respective expression in a prokaryotic system using site-directed mutagenesis. These mutations resulted in the absence or a dramatic decrease of CPO activity. The two polymorphisms were localized in noncoding part of the gene 1) a C/G polymorphism in the promotor region, 142 bp upstream from the transcriptional initiation site (-142C/G), and 2) a 6 bp deletion polymorphism in the 3 noncoding part of the CPO gene, 574 bp downstream of the last base of the normal termination codon (+ 574 delATTCTT). Five intragenic dimorphisms are now well characterized and the high degree of allelic heterogeneity in HC is demonstrated with seven new different mutations making a total of nineteen CPO gene defects reported so far..
Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by a deficiency of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO) caused by a mutation in the CPO gene. Only 11 mutations of the gene have been reported in HCP patients. We report another mutation in a Japanese family. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism and direct sequence analyses demonstrated a C to T substitution in exon 1 of the CPO gene at nucleotide position 85, which lies in the putative presequence for targeting to mitochondria. This mutation changes the codon for glutamine to a termination codon at amino acid position 29. MaeI restriction analysis showed two other carriers in the family. The C-T mutation is located within a recently proposed putative alternative translation initiation codon (TIC-1), supporting that TIC-1 is the real TIC rather than TIC-2..

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by tissue iron deposition secondary to excessive dietary iron absorption. We recently reported that HFE, the protein defective in HH, was physically associated with the transferrin receptor (TfR) in duodenal crypt cells and proposed that mutations in HFE attenuate the uptake of transferrin-bound iron from plasma by duodenal crypt cells, leading to up-regulation of transporters for dietary iron. Here, we tested the hypothesis that HFE-/- mice have increased duodenal expression of the divalent metal transporter (DMT1). By 4 weeks of age, the HFE-/- mice demonstrated iron loading when compared with HFE +/+ littermates, with elevated transferrin saturations (68. 4% vs. 49. 8%) and elevated liver iron concentrations (985 micrograms vs. 381 micrograms). By using Northern blot analyses, we quantitated duodenal expression of both classes of DMT1 transcripts one containing an iron responsive element (IRE), called DMT1 (IRE), and one containing no IRE, called DMT1 (non-IRE). The positive control for DMT1 up-regulation was a murine model of dietary iron deficiency that demonstrated greatly increased levels of duodenal DMT1 (IRE) mRNA. HFE-/- mice also demonstrated an increase in duodenal DMT1 (IRE) mRNA (average 7. 7-fold), despite their elevated transferrin saturation and hepatic iron content. Duodenal expression of DMT1 (non-IRE) was not increased, nor was hepatic expression of DMT1 increased. These data support the model for HH in which HFE mutations lead to inappropriately low crypt cell iron, with resultant stabilization of DMT1 (IRE) mRNA, up-regulation of DMT1, and increased absorption of dietary iron.
Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive genetic disorder of iron metabolism. The HFE candidate gene encoding an HLA class I-like protein involved in HH was identified in 1996. Two missense mutations have been described C282Y, accounting for 80% to 90% of HH chromosomes, and H63D, which is associated with a milder form of the disease representing 40% to 70% of non-C282Y HH chromosomes. We report here on the analysis of C282Y, H63D, and the 193A-- > T substitution leading to the S65C missense substitution in a large series of probands and controls. The results confirm that the C282Y substitution was the main mutation involved in hemochromatosis, accounting for 85% of carrier chromosomes, whereas the H63D substitution represented 39% of the HH chromosomes that did not carry the C282Y mutation. In addition, our screening showed that the S65C substitution was significantly enriched in probands with at least one chromosome without an assigned mutation. This substitution accounted for 7. 8% of HH chromosomes that were neither C282Y nor H63D. This enrichment of S65C among HH chromosomes suggests that the S65C substitution is associated with the mild form of hemochromatosis.
Hereditary hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT) is an autosomal dominant disease (OMIM 145001) that has recently been mapped to chromosomal region 1q21-q32 (HRPT2). Here we report two families with HPT-JT syndrome in which adult renal hamartomas or cystic kidney disease were prominent associated features, possibly representing a new phenotypic variant of the HPT-JT syndrome. In the first family, renal lesions were present in five out of six affected individuals, whereas HPT and JT were seen in four and two cases, respectively. In the second family, JT was found in three of the five affected individuals and two affected members also exhibited polycystic kidney disease. The possibility of the latter cosegregating as a separate autosomal dominant gene can not be ruled out. A sex-dependent penetrance of primary HPT, resulting in predominantly male-affected cases was evident in the two families. Twenty microsatellite markers in the HRPT2 region were typed, in addition to markers in the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 1 and 2 regions at 11q13 and 10q11. The disease in these two kindreds was linked to five markers in the 1q21-q32 region (logarithm-of-odds scores 3. 2-4 2-4. 2), whereas linkage to the MEN1 and MEN2 regions was excluded. Meiotic recombinations detected in affected individuals placed the locus telomeric of D1S215, thus narrowing the HRPT2 region from > 60 to approximately 34 centimorgans. Loss of heterozygosity was studied in seven renal hamartomas from two affected individuals in the first family, as well as in a jaw tumor and a parathyroid tumor from the second family. All renal hamartomas showed loss of heterozygosity at the 1q21-q32 region. The losses invariably involved the wild type allele derived from the unaffected parent, suggesting the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene in this region
Hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation (HPD; dopa-responsive dystonia, DRD) have been recently found to be caused by a genetic defect in the GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) gene. In this study, we quantified the mRNA level of GCH1 in phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated mononuclear blood cells from one Japanese family that do not have a mutation in the coding region or splice junctions of the gene. The results showed that the amounts of the GCH1 mRNA were decreased to about 40% of the normal level in both patients and carriers. In addition, we found that the GCH1 mRNA was transcribed from only one allele, indicating that the other allele was in an inactive state. These results suggest that some novel mutations should exist on one of the alleles in some unknown region of the GCH1 gene, and may decrease the GCH1 mRNA causing the HPD/DRD symptoms..

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are thought to influence the structure of hnRNA and participate in the processing of hnRNA to mRNA. The hnRNP U protein is an abundant nucleoplasmic phosphoprotein that is the largest of the major hnRNP proteins (120 kDa by SDS-PAGE). HnRNP U binds pre-mRNA in vivo and binds both RNA and ssDNA in vitro. Here we describe the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the hnRNP U protein, the determination of its amino acid sequence and the delineation of a region in this protein that confers RNA binding. The predicted amino acid sequence of hnRNP U contains 806 amino acids (88,939 Daltons), and shows no extensive homology to any known proteins. The N-terminus is rich in acidic residues and the C-terminus is glycine-rich. In addition, a glutamine-rich stretch, a putative NTP binding site and a putative nuclear localization signal are present. It could not be defined from the sequence what segment of the protein confers its RNA binding activity. We identified an RNA binding activity within the C-terminal glycine-rich 112 amino acids. This region, designated U protein glycine-rich RNA binding region (U-gly), can by itself bind RNA. Furthermore, fusion of U-gly to a heterologous bacterial protein (maltose binding protein) converts this fusion protein into an RNA binding protein. A 26 amino acid peptide within U-gly is necessary for the RNA binding activity of the U protein. Interestingly, this peptide contains a cluster of RGG repeats with characteristic spacing and this motif is found also in several other RNA binding proteins. We have termed this region the RGG box and propose that it is an RNA binding motif and a predictor of RNA binding activity.

Heterozygous germ-line mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes lead to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The disease susceptibility of individuals who constitutionally lack both wild-type alleles is unknown. We have identified three offspring in a hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer family who developed hematological malignancy at a very early age, and at least two of them displayed signs of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). DNA sequence analysis and allele-specific amplification in two siblings revealed a homozygous MLH1 mutation (C676T-- > Arg226Stop). Thus, a homozygous germ-line MLH1 mutation and consequent mismatch repair deficiency results in a mutator phenotype characterized by leukemia and/or lymphoma associated with neurofibromatosis type 1..
Heterozygous loss of Six5 in mice is sufficient to cause ocular cataracts.
Heterozygous mutations encoding abnormal forms of the death receptor Fas dominantly interfere with Fas-induced lymphocyte apoptosis in human autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome. This effect, rather than depending on ligand-induced receptor oligomerization, was found to stem from ligand- independent interaction of wild-type and mutant Fas receptors through a specific region in the extracellular domain. Preassociated Fas complexes were found in living cells by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between variants of green fluorescent protein. These results show that formation of preassociated receptor complexes is necessary for Fas signaling and dominant interference in human disease..
Heterozygous mutations in the CD95 (APO-1/Fas) receptor occur in most individuals with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and dominantly interfere with apoptosis by an unknown mechanism. We show that local or global alterations in the structure of the cytoplasmic death domain from nine independent ALPS CD95 death-domain mutations result in a failure to bind the FADD/MORT1 signaling protein. Despite heterozygosity for the abnormal allele, lymphocytes from ALPS patients showed markedly decreased FADD association and a loss of caspase recruitment and activation after CD95 crosslinking. These data suggest that intracytoplasmic CD95 mutations in ALPS impair apoptosis chiefly by disrupting death-domain interactions with the signaling protein FADD/MORT1..
High dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI.
High doses of inhaled salbutamol produce substantial improvements in airway response in patients with asthma, and are associated with dose-dependent systemic beta-adrenoceptor responses. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether tachyphylaxis occurs during prolonged treatment with high dose inhaled salbutamol. Twelve asthmatic patients (FEV1, 81 +/- 4% predicted), requiring only occasional inhaled beta-agonists as their sole therapy, were given a 14-day treatment with high dose inhaled salbutamol (HDS), 4,000 micrograms daily, low dose inhaled salbutamol (LDS), 800 micrograms daily, or placebo (PI) by metered-dose inhaler in a double-blind, randomized crossover design. During the 14-day run-in and during washout periods, inhaled beta-agonists were withheld and ipratropium bromide was substituted for rescue purposes. At the end of each 14-day treatment, a dose-response curve (DRC) was performed, and airway (FEV1, FEF25-75) chronotropic (HR), tremor, and metabolic (K, Glu) responses were measured at each step (from 100 to 4,000 micrograms). Treatment had no significant effect on baseline values. There were dose-dependent increases in FEV1 and FEF25-75 (p less than 0.001), and pretreatment with HDS did not displace the DRC to the right. DRC for HR (p less than 0.001), K (p less than 0.001), and Glu (p less than 0.005) were attenuated after treatment with HDS compared with PI. There were also differences between HDS and LDS for HR (p less than 0.001) and Glu (p less than 0.05) responses. Frequency and severity of subjective adverse effects were also reduced after HDS: tremor (p less than 0.001), palpitations (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the present study, the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose-urethane. Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol, pindolol, labetalol and atenolol, as well as after clonidine, but not after hexamethonium or carbachol. Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methylatropine or previously vagotomised. These results are compatible with interference by isoniazid with GABAergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone. Such interference could be exerted centrally, possibly at the nucleus ambiguus, or peripherally at the sinus node.

High frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is known to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease. AIM: We studied the effect of high frequency STN stimulation in 23 patients. METHOD: Twenty-three patients suffering from severe Parkinson's disease (Stages III-V on Hoehn and Yahr scale) and, particularly bradykinesia, rigidity, and levodopa-induced dyskinesias underwent bilateral implantation of electrodes in the STN. Preoperative and postoperative assessments of these patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up, in "on" and "off" drug conditions, was carried out using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr staging, England activities of daily living score and video recordings. RESULTS: After one year of electrical stimulation of the STN, the patients' scores for activities of daily living and motor examination scores (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts II and III) off medication improved by 62% and 61% respectively (p<0.0005). The subscores for the akinesia, rigidity, tremor and gait also improved. (p<0.0005). The average levodopa dose decreased from 813 mg to 359 mg. The cognitive functions remained unchanged. Two patients developed device-related complications and two patients experienced abnormal weight gain. CONCLUSION: Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation is an effective treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease. It reduces the severity of "off" phase symptoms, improves the axial symptoms and reduces levodopa requirements. The reduction in the levodopa dose is useful in controlling drug-induced dyskinesias.
High incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension associated with appetite suppressants in Belgium.
High level expression of the nm23-H1 gene, which encodes for a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, has been found to correlate with diminished metastasis in some tumors but not in others. We have previously identified the protein product of the nm23-H1 gene in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels and have designated it p19/nm23. In neuroblastoma, higher levels of p19/nm23, which are associated with amplification of the N-myc oncogene, large tumor mass, and metastasis, were observed in advanced stage tumors compared with limited stage disease. Because of the variable expression of nm23-H1 in different tumors, we have investigated the relationship between amounts of the protein and cell proliferation. The levels of p19/nm23 were compared between resting and mitotically stimulated normal human PBLs and in leukemia cells. The amount of p19/nm23 increased in normal lymphocytes in response to mitotic stimulation and paralleled the increase in DNA synthesis. In leukemia cells obtained from patients with different subtypes of acute leukemia, p19/nm23 levels were also increased relative to resting normal lymphocytes. Treatment of mitotically stimulated lymphocytes with cyclosporin, which inhibits proliferation, blocked the increase in p19/nm23; treatment of the leukemia cell line HL-60 with dimethylsulfoxide, which induces terminal differentiation, resulted in diminished levels of p19/nm23. Our data therefore provide evidence that nm23-H1 expression is related to cell proliferative activity..
High levels of D-serine are found in mammalian brain, where it is an endogenous agonist of the strichinine-insensitive site of N-methyl D-aspartate type of glutamate receptors. D-serine is enriched in protoplasmic astrocytes that occur in gray matter areas of the brain and was shown to be synthesized from L-serine. We now report cloning and expression of human serine racemase, an enzyme that catalyses the synthesis of D-serine from L-serine. The enzyme displays a high homology to the murine serine racemase. It contains a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate attachment sequence similar to bacterial biosynthetic threonine dehydratase. Northern-blot analysis show high levels of human serine racemase in areas known to contain large amounts of endogenous D-serine, such as hippocampus and corpus callosum. Robust synthesis of D-serine was detected in cells transfected with human serine racemase, demonstrating the conservation of D-amino acid metabolism in humans. Serine racemase may be a therapeutic target in psychiatric diseases as supplementation of D-serine greatly improves schizophrenia symptoms. We identify the human serine racemase genomic structure and show that the gene encompasses seven exons and localizes to chromosome 17q13.3. Identification of the intron-exon boundaries of the human serine racemase gene will be useful to search for mutations in neuropsychiatric disorders.

High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is an important treatment for Burkitt lymphoma, but can cause hepatic and renal toxicity when its clearance is delayed. We report a case of acute renal failure after HD-MTX therapy in a patient with ileostomy, The patient was a 3-year-old boy who had received a living-related liver transplantation for congenital biliary atresia. At day 833 after the transplantation, he was diagnosed with PTLD (post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, Burkitt-type malignant lymphoma). During induction therapy, he suffered ileal perforation and ileostomy was performed. Subsequent HD-MTX therapy caused acute renal failure that required continuous hemodialysis. We supposed that intravascular hypovolemia due to substantial drainage from the ileostoma caused acute prerenal failure. After recovery of his renal function, we could safely treat the patient with HD-MTX therapy by controlling drainage from ileostoma with total parenteral nutrition.

High-resolution analyses of complex chromosome rearrangements (CCR) have demonstrated in individuals with abnormal phenotypes that not all seemingly balanced CCRs based on G-banding are completely balanced at breakpoint level. Here we report on an apparently balanced de novo CCR involving chromosomes 2, 3 and 5 present in a 6-month-old girl. She was referred for genetic evaluation because of severe psychomotor retardation, distinctive dysmorphic features and microcephaly. A 1Mb resolution array-CGH analysis of DNA from the patient revealed a deletion of about 6Mb for chromosome 2. FISH analysis showed that the deletion interval found in band 2q22 mapped at the translocation breakpoint, and that the ZFHX1B gene, which is known to be involved in the Mowat-Wilson syndrome, is located within the deletion interval. To our knowledge this is the first case of a complex chromosomal rearrangement associated with Mowat-Wilson syndrome. Our data illustrate the important role for high-resolution investigation of apparently balanced chromosome rearrangements in patients with unexplained psychomotor retardation and/or other clinical features, and should contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in chromosome rearrangement.
Higher optical density of an antigen assay predicts thrombosis in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is implicated in cardiomyopathy (CM) and in elevated plasma lactate (LA) in AIDS through mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction. To determine mitochondrial events from HAART in vivo, 8-week-old hemizygous transgenic AIDS mice (NL4-3Delta gag/pol; TG) and wild-type FVB/n littermates were treated with the HAART combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir or vehicle control for 10 days or 35 days. At termination of the experiments, mice underwent echocardiography, quantitation of abundance of molecular markers of CM (ventricular mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic factor [ANF] and sarcoplasmic calcium ATPase [SERCA2]), and determination of plasma LA. Myocardial histologic features were analyzed semiquantitatively and results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. After 35 days in the TG + HAART cohort, left ventricular mass increased 160% by echocardiography. Molecularly, ANF mRNA increased 250% and SERCA2 mRNA decreased 57%. Biochemically, LA was elevated (8.5 +/- 2.0 mM). Pathologically, granular cytoplasmic changes were found in cardiac myocytes, indicating enlarged, damaged mitochondria. Findings were confirmed ultrastructurally. No changes were found in other cohorts. After 10 days, only ANF was elevated, and only in the TG + HAART cohort. Results show that cumulative HAART caused mitochondrial CM with elevated LA in AIDS transgenic mice.
Hippocampal integrity is essential for cognitive functions. On the other hand, induction of metallothionein (MT) by ZnSO(4) and its role in neuroprotection has been documented. The present study aimed to explore the effect of MT induction on carmustine (BCNU)-induced hippocampal cognitive dysfunction in rats. A total of 60 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups (15/group): The control group injected with single doses of normal saline (i.c.v) followed 24 h later by BCNU solvent (i.v). The second group administered ZnSO(4) (0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline, i.c.v, once) then BCNU solvent (i.v) after 24 h. Third group received BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) 24 h after injection with normal saline (i.c.v). Fourth group received a single dose of ZnSO(4) (0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline, i.c.v) then BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) after 24 h. The obtained data revealed that BCNU administration resulted in deterioration of learning and short-term memory (STM), as measured by using radial arm water maze, accompanied with decreased hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. Also, BCNU administration increased serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), hippocampal MT and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents as well as caspase-3 activity in addition to histological alterations. ZnSO(4) pretreatment counteracted BCNU-induced inhibition of GR and depletion of GSH and resulted in significant reduction in the levels of MDA and TNFalpha as well as the activity of caspase-3. The histological features were improved in hippocampus of rats treated with ZnSO(4) + BCNU compared to only BCNU-treated animals. In conclusion, MT induction halts BCNU-induced hippocampal toxicity as it prevented GR inhibition and GSH depletion and counteracted the increased levels of TNFalpha, MDA and caspase-3 activity with subsequent preservation of cognition.
Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or congenital intestinal aganglionosis, is a relatively common disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the nerve plexuses of the lower digestive tract, resulting in intestinal obstruction in neonates. Mutations in genes of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) signaling pathways have been shown to be associated in HSCR patients. In this study, we collected genomic DNA samples from 55 HSCR patients in central Taiwan and analyzed the coding regions of the RET and EDNRB genes by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. In the 55 patients, an A to G transition was detected in two (identical twin brothers). The mutation was at the end of RET exon 19 at codon 1062 (Y1062C), a reported critical site for the signaling pathways. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in exons 2, 7, 11, 13, and 15 of RET and exon 4 of EDNRB in the HSCR patients or controls were detected. The differences between patients and controls in allele distribution of the five RET polymorphic sites were statistically significant. The most frequent genotype encompassing exons 2 and 13 SNPs (the polymorphic sites with the highest percentage of heterozygotes) was AA/GG in patients, which was different from the AG/GT in the normal controls. Transmission disequilibrium was observed in exons 2, 7, and 13, indicating nonrandom association of the susceptibility alleles with the disease in the patients. This study represents the first comprehensive genetic analysis of HSCR disease in Taiwan.
Histamine antagonists and d-tubocurarine-induced hypotension in cardiac surgical patients.
Histidinemia. Classical and atypical form in siblings.
Histone acetylation plays a key role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Recently, histone acetylation and deacetylation were found to be catalyzed by structurally distinct, multisubunit complexes that mediate, respectively, activation and repression of transcription. Here, we identify SAP30 as a novel component of the human histone deacetylase complex that includes Sin3, the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, histone binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48, as well as other polypeptides. Moreover, we describe a SAP30 homolog in yeast that is functionally related to Sin3 and the histone deacetylase Rpd3. The human SAP30 complex is active in deacetylating core histone octamers, but inactive in deacetylating nucleosomal histones due to the inability of the histone binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48 to gain access to nucleosomal histones. These results define SAP30 as a component of a histone deacetylase complex conserved among eukaryotic organisms.
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a relatively chemosensitive malignancy. However, for those who relapse, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant is the treatment of choice which relies on adequate disease control with salvage chemotherapy. Regimens commonly used often require inpatient administration and can be difficult to deliver due to toxicity. Gemcitabine and cisplatin have activity in HL, non-overlapping toxicity with first-line chemotherapeutics, and may be delivered in an outpatient setting. In this retrospective single-centre analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory HL treated with gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) day (D)1, D8 and D15; methylprednisolone 1,000 mg D1-5; and cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) D15, every 28 days (GEM-P) were included. Demographic, survival, response and toxicity data were recorded. Forty-one eligible patients were identified: median age 27. One hundred and twenty-two cycles of GEM-P were administered in total (median 3 cycles; range 1-6). Twenty of 41 (48 %) patients received GEM-P as second-line treatment and 11/41 (27 %) as third-line therapy. Overall response rate (ORR) to GEM-P in the entire cohort was 80 % (complete response (CR) 37 %, partial response 44 %) with 14/15 CR confirmed as a metabolic CR on PET and ORR of 85 % in the 20 second-line patients. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were haematological: neutropenia 54 % and thrombocytopenia 51 %. Median follow-up from the start of GEM-P was 4.5 years. Following GEM-P, 5-year progression-free survival was 46 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 30-62 %) and 5-year overall survival was 59 % (95 % CI, 43-74 %). Fourteen of 41 patients proceeded directly to autologous transplant. GEM-P is a salvage chemotherapy with relatively high response rates, leading to successful transplantation in appropriate patients, in the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL.
Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a nuclear serine/threonine kinase of the subfamily of dual-specificity Yak1-related kinase proteins. HIPK2 was first described as a homeodomain-interacting protein kinase acting as a corepressor for homeodomain transcription factors. More recently, it was reported that HIPK2 plays a role in p53-mediated cellular apoptosis and could also participate in the regulation of the cell cycle. US11 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of several processes related to the survival of cells submitted to environmental stresses by mechanisms that are not fully elucidated. In an attempt to better understand the multiple functions of US11, we identified cellular binding partners of this protein by using the yeast two-hybrid system. We report that US11 interacts with HIPK2 through the PEST domain of HIPK2 and that this interaction occurs also in human cells. This interaction modifies the subcellular distribution of HIPK2 and protects the cell against the HIPK2-induced cell growth arrest.
Homeodomain-interacting protein kinases, a novel family of co-repressors for homeodomain transcription factors.
Homologues of a protein originally isolated from snake venom and frog skin secretions are present in many vertebrate species. They contain 80-90 amino acids, 10 of which are cysteines with identical spacing. Various names have been given to these proteins, such as mamba intestinal protein 1 (MIT1), Bv8 (Bombina variegata molecular mass approximately 8 kDa), prokineticins and endocrine-gland vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF). Their amino-terminal sequences are identical, and so we propose that the sequence of their first four residues, AVIT, is used as a name for this family. From a comparison of the sequences, two types of AVIT proteins can be discerned. These proteins seem to be distributed widely in mammalian tissues and are known to bind to G-protein-coupled receptors. Members of this family have been shown to stimulate contraction of the guinea pig ileum, to cause hyperalgesia after injection into rats and to be active as specific growth factors. Moreover, the messenger RNA level of one of these AVIT proteins changes rhythmically in the region of the brain known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This shows that members of this new family of small proteins are involved in diverse biological processes.

HumHtrA2 or Omi is a recently described member of a novel family of mammalian serine proteases homologous to the Escherichia coli htrA gene product. Although the physiological function of members of this new family is unclear, the current understanding is that as well as being involved with the degradation aberrantly folded proteins during conditions of cellular stress, they may possess a chaperone-like role under normal conditions. In this report we describe the overexpression of humHtrA2 in two heterologous systems comparing the merits of each. We found that molecular analysis of processing events in Sf9 cells allowed us to revisit E. coli expression systems which were initially unsuccessful. Using E. coli we were able to produce milligram amounts of >90% pure recombinant enzyme as determined by SDS-PAGE gels. By means of fluorescently labeled substrates alpha- and beta-casein and zymography, the proteolytic activity of recombinant HumHtrA2 was also demonstrated.
Human 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (MPG protein) initiates base excision repair by severing the glycosylic bond of numerous damaged bases. In comparison, homologues of the Rad23 proteins (hHR23) and the hXPC protein are involved in the recognition of damaged bases in global genome repair, a subset of nucleotide excision repair. In this report, we show that the hHR23A and -B also interact with the MPG protein and can serve as accessory proteins for DNA damage recognition in base excision repair. Furthermore, the MPG.hHR23 protein complex elevates the rate of MPG protein-catalyzed excision from hypoxanthine-containing substrates. This increased excision rate is correlated with a greater binding affinity of the MPG protein-hHR23 protein complex for damaged DNA. These data suggest that the hHR23 proteins function as universal DNA damage recognition accessory proteins in both of these major excision repair pathways.
Human 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase exists in four isoforms, which belong to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and are named AKR1C1-AKR1C4. The properties of AKR1C3 have not been fully characterized compared to the other isoforms. In addition, a cDNA that shows more than 99% homology with AKR1C3 cDNA has been cloned from human myeloblasts. We have here expressed and purified a recombinant enzyme (designated as DBDH) from this cDNA. DBDH oxidized xenobiotic alicyclic alcohols and 3alpha- or 17beta-hydroxy-5beta-androstanes, and catalyzed the reversible conversion between prostaglandin D2 and 9alpha,11beta-prostaglandin F2 more efficiently than that of 3alpha- or 17beta-hydroxysteroids:the respective Km values were 0.6 and 6.8 microM, and kcat/Km values were about 1,000 min-1.mM-1. Anti-inflammatory drugs highly inhibited the enzyme. The recombinant AKR1C3 prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of DBDH also showed the same properties as the wild-type DBDH. Analyses of expression of mRNAs for DBDH and AKR1C3 by reverse transcription-PCR indicated that only one mRNA species for DBDH is expressed in 33 human specimens of liver, kidney, lung, brain, heart, spleen, adrenal gland, small intestine, placenta, prostate, and testis. These results suggest that AKR1C3 acts as prostaglandin D2 11-ketoreductase, and that its principal gene in the human has a coding region represented by DBDH cDNA.
Human C1qRp is identical with CD93 and the mNI-11 antigen but does not bind C1q.
Human DNA helicase II (HDH II) is a novel ATP-dependent DNA unwinding enzyme, purified to apparent homogeneity from HeLa cells, which (i) unwinds exclusively DNA duplexes, (ii) prefers partially unwound substrates and (iii) proceeds in the 3' to 5' direction on the bound strand. HDH II is a heterodimer of 72 and 87 kDa polypeptides. It shows single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity, as well as double-stranded DNA binding capacity. All these activities comigrate in gel filtration and glycerol gradients, giving a sedimentation coefficient of 7.4S and a Stokes radius of approximately 46 A, corresponding to a native molecular weight of 158 kDa. The antibodies raised in rabbit against either polypeptide can remove from the solution all the activities of HDH II. Photoaffinity labelling with [alpha-32P]ATP labelled both polypeptides. Microsequencing of the separate polypeptides of HDH II and cross-reaction with specific antibodies showed that this enzyme is identical to Ku, an autoantigen recognized by the sera of scleroderma and lupus erythematosus patients, which binds specifically to duplex DNA ends and is regulator of a DNA-dependent protein kinase. Recombinant HDH II/Ku protein expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli cells showed DNA binding and helicase activities indistinguishable from those of the isolated protein. The exclusively nuclear location of HDH II/Ku antigen, its highly specific affinity for double-stranded DNA, its abundance and its newly demonstrated ability to unwind exclusively DNA duplexes, point to an additional, if still unclear, role for this molecule in DNA metabolism.
Human DNA helicase II: a novel DNA unwinding enzyme identified as the Ku autoantigen.
Human Daxx is a protein that functions, in part, as a transcriptional co-repressor through its interaction with a growing number of nuclear, DNA-associated proteins. To determine the mechanism by which hDaxx represses transcription, we used conventional chromatography to isolate endogenous hDaxx. We determined that hDaxx has an apparent molecular weight of 360 kDa, which is consistent with the fact that multiple domains of hDaxx are required for transcriptional repression and suggests that hDaxx associates with multiple proteins. Using co-fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that hDaxx associates with proteins that are critical for transcriptional repression, such as histone deacetylase II, constituents of chromatin such as core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, and Dek, a chromatin-associated protein reported to change the topology of DNA in chromatin in vitro. We also demonstrate a requirement for the SPT domain and the first paired amphipathic helix of hDaxx for its association with histone deacetylase II and acetylated histone H4, respectively. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that the association of hDaxx with chromatin-related proteins is dependent on the post-translational phosphorylation status of hDaxx. A working model for the repressive action of hDaxx through its association with chromatin related proteins is presented.

Human cDNAs for cytosolic and mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) were cloned by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli glyA mutant with a human cDNA library. The cDNA for the cytosolic enzyme encodes a 483-residue protein of M(r) 53,020. The cDNA for the mitochondrial enzyme encodes a mature protein of 474 residues of M(r) 52,400. The deduced protein sequences share a high degree of sequence identity to each other (63%), and the individual isozymes are highly homologous to the analogous rabbit liver cytosolic (92% identity) and mitochondrial (97% identity) SHMT isozymes (Martini, F., Angelaccio, S., Pascarella, S., Barra, D., Bossa, F., and Schirch, V. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5499-5509; Martini, F., Maras, B., Tanci, P., Angelaccio, S., Pascarella, S., Barra, D., Bossa, F., and Schirch, V. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8509-8519). SHMT is a highly conserved protein with the human isozymes retaining about 43% sequence identity with the E. coli protein. The human cytosolic and mitochondrial SHMT genes were localized to chromosome regions 17p11.2 and 12q13, respectively. The high degree of nucleotide sequence identity between the two isozymes, and the presence of keratin genes in both chromosomal regions, is consistent with these regions of chromosome 12 and 17 arising by a duplication event.

Human corneal GlcNac 6-O-sulfotransferase and mouse intestinal GlcNac 6-O-sulfotransferase both produce keratan sulfate.
Human corneal N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase (hCGn6ST) has been identified by the positional candidate approach as the gene responsible for macular corneal dystrophy (MCD). Because of its high homology to carbohydrate sulfotransferases and the presence of mutations of this gene in MCD patients who lack sulfated keratan sulfate in the cornea and serum, hCGn6ST protein is thought to be a sulfotransferase that catalyzes sulfation of GlcNAc in keratan sulfate. In this report, we analyzed the enzymatic activity of hCGn6ST by expressing it in cultured cells. A lysate prepared from HeLa cells transfected with an intact form of hCGn6ST cDNA or culture medium from cells transfected with a secreted form of hCGn6ST cDNA showed an activity of transferring sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc of synthetic oligosaccharide substrates in vitro. When hCGn6ST was expressed together with human keratan sulfate Gal-6-sulfotransferase (hKSG6ST), HeLa cells produced highly sulfated carbohydrate detected by an anti-keratan sulfate antibody 5D4. These results indicate that hCGn6ST transfers sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc in keratan sulfate. Amino acid substitutions in hCGn6ST identical to changes resulting from missense mutations found in MCD patients abolished enzymatic activity. Moreover, mouse intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase had the same activity as hCGn6ST. This observation suggests that mouse intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase is the orthologue of hCGn6ST and functions as a sulfotransferase to produce keratan sulfate in the cornea.
Human corticotropin-releasing hormone (hCRH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) are known to stimulate ventilation after i.v. administration in humans. In a placebo-controlled, single-blind study we aimed to clarify if both peptides act by altering central chemosensitivity. Two subsequent CO2-rebreathing tests were performed in healthy young volunteers. During the first test 0.9% NaCl was given i.v.; during the second test 200 micrograms of hCRH (n = 12) or 400 micrograms of TRH (n = 6) was administered i.v. Nine subjects received 0.9% NaCl i.v. during both rebreathing manoeuvres. The CO2-response curves for the two tests were compared within the same subject. In the hCRH group a marked parallel shift of the CO2-response curve to the left was observed after hCRH (P < 0.01). The same effect occurred following TRH but was less striking (P = 0.05). hCRH and TRH caused a reduction in the CO2 threshold. The CO2-response curves in the control group were nearly identical. The results indicate an additive effect of both releasing hormones on the hypercapnic ventilatory response in humans, presumably independent of central chemosensitivity.

Human embryonal kinase 2 (HEK2) is a protein-tyrosine kinase that is a member of the EPH family of receptors. Transcripts for HEK2 have a wide tissue distribution. Recently, a still growing family of ligands, which we have named LERKs, for ligands of the eph-related kinases, has been isolated. In order to analyze functional effects between the LERKs and the HEK2 receptor, we expressed HEK2 cDNA in an interleukin-3-dependent progenitor cell line 32D that grows as single cells in culture. Within the group of LERKs, LERK-2 and -5 were shown to bind to HEK2. Membrane-bound and soluble forms of LERK-2 were demonstrated to signal through HEK2 as judged by receptor phosphorylation. Coincubation of HEK2 and LERK-2 expressing cells induced cell-cell adhesion and formation of cell aggregates. This interaction could be inhibited by preincubation of HEK2 expressing cells with soluble LERK-2. Coexpression of HEK2 and LERK-2 in 32D cells showed reduced kinase activity and autophosphorylation of HEK2 compared with the juxtacrine stimulation, which seems to be due to a reduced sensitivity of the receptor.
Human endothelial cells (EC) costimulate CD4(+) memory T cell activation through CD58-CD2 interactions. In this study we tested the hypothesis that EC activate distinct costimulatory pathways in T cells that target specific transcription factors. AP-1, composed of fos and jun proteins, is a critical effector of TCR signaling and binds several sites in the IL-2 promoter. EC augment c-fos promoter activity in T cells; however, deletion analysis reveals no transcription factor binding sites in the promoter uniquely responsive to EC costimulation. Overexpression of AP-1 proteins in T cells augments the activity of an AP-1-luciferase reporter gene equally in the absence or the presence of EC costimulation. Interestingly, EC stimulate a similar 2- to 3-fold up-regulation of AP-1, NF-AT, NF-kappaB, and NF-IL-2-luciferase reporters. CD2 mAbs completely block EC effects on all of these pathways, as well as costimulation of IL-2 secretion. We conclude that EC costimulation through CD2 does not trigger a single distinct costimulatory pathway in T cells, but rather, it amplifies several pathways downstream of the TCR. Indeed, we find that early EC costimulation acts " upstream " of the TCR by promoting lipid raft aggregation, thus amplifying TCR signaling. Soluble CD2 mAbs block EC-induced raft aggregation, whereas cross-linking CD2 promotes aggregation. These data are consistent with the critical role of CD2 in organizing the T cell-APC contact zone.

Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) is a febrile tick-borne illness caused by a recently discovered intracellular bacterium remarkable for its tropism for professionally phagocytic neutrophils. Monoclonal antibodies against the P-selectin binding domain of the leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand, PSGL-1, prevented HGE cell binding and infection, as did enzymatic digestion of PSGL-1. Furthermore, simultaneous neoexpression in nonsusceptible cells of complementary DNAs for both PSGL-1 and its modifying alpha-(1,3) fucosyltransferase, Fuc-TVII, allowed binding and infection by HGE. Thus, the HGE bacterium specifically bound to fucosylated leukocyte PSGL-1. Selectin mimicry is likely central to the organism's unique ability to target and infect neutrophils.

Human malignant brain tumors have a poor prognosis in spite of surgery and radiation therapy. Cubic phases consist of curved biocontinuous lipid bilayers, separating two congruent networks of water channels. Used as a host for cytotoxic drugs, the gel-like matrix can easily be applied to the walls of a surgical resection cavity. For human glioblastoma recurrences, the feasibility, safety, and short-term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study. A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a glioblastoma multiforme underwent re-resection and received an intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin cubic phases in different dosages. Six of the patients received more than 15 mg paclitaxel and suffered from moderate to severe brain edema, while the remaining patients received only a total of 15 mg paclitaxel. In the latter group, brain edema was markedly reduced and dealt medically. Intracavitary chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma using cubic phases is feasible and safe, yet the clinical benefit remains to be examined in a clinical phase II study.

Human nuclei contain three different RNA polymerases: polymerases I, II, and III. Each polymerase is a multi-subunit enzyme with 12-17 subunits. The localization of these subunits is limited by the paucity of antibodies suitable for immunofluorescence. We now describe eight different monoclonal antibodies that react specifically with RPB6 (also known as RPA20, RPB14.4, or RPC20), RPB8 (RPA18, RPB17, or RPC18), RPC32, or RPC39 and which are suitable for such studies. Each antibody detects one specific band in immunoblots of nuclear extracts; each also immunoprecipitates large complexes containing many other subunits. When used for immunofluorescence, antibodies against the subunits shared by all three polymerases (i.e., RPB6, RPB8) gave a few bright foci in nucleoli and nucleoplasm, as well as many fainter nucleoplasmic foci; all the bright foci were generally distinct from speckles containing Sm antigen. Antibodies against the two subunits found only in polymerase III (i.e., RPC32, RPC39) gave a few bright and many faint nucleoplasmic foci, but no nucleolar foci. Growth in two transcriptional inhibitors-5, 6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole and actinomycin D-led to the redistribution of each subunit in a characteristic manner.

Human orythrocytes that are homozygous for the Duarte enzyme variant of galactosemia (D/D) have a characteristic isoform on isoelectric focusing and 50% reduction in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) enzyme activity. The Duarte biochemical phenotype has a molecular genotype of N314D/N314D. The characteristic Duarte isoform is also associated with a variant called the " Los Angeles (LA) phenotype, " which has increased GALT enzyme activity. We evaluated GALT enzyme activity and screened the GALT genes of 145 patients with one or more N314D-containing alleles. We found seven with the LA biochemical phenotype, and all had a 1721C-- > T transition in exon 7 in cis with the N314D missense mutation. The 1721C-- > T transition is a neutral polymorphism for leucine at amino acid 218 (L218L). In pedigree analyses, this 1721C-- > T transition segregated with the LA phenotype of increased GALT activity in three different biochemical phenotypes (LA/N, LA/G, and LA/D). To determine the mechanism for increased activity of the LA variant, we compared GALT mRNA, protein abundance, and enzyme thermal stability in lymphoblast cell lines of D and LA phenotypes with comparable genotypes. GALT protein abundance was increased in LA compared to D alleles, but mRNA was similar among all genotypes. When LA/D and D/D GALT biochemical phenotypes were compared to N/N GALT phenotypes, both had 50%, as compared to 21%, reduction in GALT activity in the wild type (N/N) after exposure at identical initial enzyme activity to 50 degrees C for 15 min. We conclude that the codon change N314D in cis with the base-pair transition 1721C-- > T produces the LA variant of galactosemia and that this nucleotide change increases GALT activity by increasing GALT protein abundance without increasing transcription or decreasing thermal lability. A favorable codon bias for the mutated codon with consequently increased translation rates is postulated as the mechanism..
Human p32, interacts with B subunit of the CCAAT-binding factor, CBF/NF-Y, and inhibits CBF-mediated transcription activation in vitro.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with the majority of cervical cancers and encode a transforming protein, E6, that interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. Because E6 has p53-independent transforming activity, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for other E6-binding proteins. One such protein, E6BP, interacted with cancer-associated HPV E6 and with bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) E6. The transforming activity of BPV-1 E6 mutants correlated with their E6BP-binding ability. E6BP is identical to a putative calcium-binding protein, ERC-55, that appears to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Huntington disease (HD) has been shown to be associated with an expanded CAG repeat within a novel gene on 4p16. 3 (IT15). A total of 30 of 1, 022 affected persons (2. 9% of our cohort) did not have an expanded CAG in the disease range. The reasons for not observing expansion in affected individuals are important for determining the sensitivity of using repeat length both for diagnosis of affected patients and for predictive testing programs and may have biological relevance for the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying HD. Here we show that the majority (18) of the individuals with normal sized alleles represent misdiagnosis, sample mix-up, or clerical error. The remaining 12 patients represent possible phenocopies for HD. In at least four cases, family studies of these phenocopies excluded 4p16. 3 as the region responsible for the phenotype. Mutations in the HD gene that are other than CAG expansion have not been excluded for the remaining eight cases; however, in as many as seven of these persons, retrospective review of these patients clinical features identified characteristics not typical for HD. This study shows that on rare occasions mutations in other, as-yet-undefined genes can present with a clinical phenotype very similar to that of HD
Huntington disease (HD) is a severe autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder associated with a novel gene (IT15). Recently, we reported the cloning of Hdh, the murine homologue of IT15. Here, using an interspecific backcross, we have mapped both Hdh and the mouse homologue of human alpha-adducin (Add1), a membrane-associated cytoskeletal protein gene. Both of these genes map in the same position on mouse chromosome 5 in a region associated with ancestral chromosomal rearrangements and show no recombination with D5H4S43, D5H4S115, and D5H4S62, the murine homologues of D4S43, D4S115, and D4S62, respectively. Further mapping studies of humans, mice, and other mammalian species should reveal the nature of the rearrangements affecting this chromosomal segment during mammalian evolution..
Huntington disease (HD) is caused by expansion of a glutamine repeat in the amino-terminal region of huntingtin. Despite its widespread expression, mutant huntingtin induces selective neuronal loss in striatal neurons. Here we report that, in mutant mice expressing HD repeats, the production and aggregation of N-terminal huntingtin fragments preferentially occur in HD-affected neurons and their processes and axonal terminals. N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin form aggregates and induce neuritic degeneration in cultured striatal neurons. N-terminal mutant huntingtin also binds to synaptic vesicles and inhibits their glutamate uptake in vitro. The specific processing and accumulation of toxic fragments of N-terminal huntingtin in HD-affected striatal neurons, especially in their neuronal processes and axonal terminals, may contribute to the selective neuropathology of HD..

Hydrogen cyanamide is a plant growth regulator used in agriculture to induce bud break in fruit trees. Contact with the skin can result in percutaneous absorption of the substance that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and can induce acetaldehyde syndrome in case of alcohol use. The purpose of this report is to describe two cases of a disulfiram-like syndrome following occupational exposure to hydrogen cyanamide. The first case involved a 59-year-old man who used Dormex, which contains hydrogen cyanamide, without protection after consuming a large amount of alcohol during a meal. In less than 1 hour after the ingestion of alcohol, he developed malaise with flushing of the face, tachycardia, and dyspnea. Manifestations regressed spontaneously under surveillance in the hospital. The second case occurred in a 55-year-old farmer following cutaneous contact with Dormex. Five hours after exposure, he developed disulfiram-like syndrome with flushing, tachycardia, and arterial hypotension after consuming three glasses of wine. The patient recovered spontaneously in 3 hours under surveillance in the hospital. These cases confirm the necessity of avoiding alcohol consumption as recommended in the instructions for use of Dormex and of preventing cutaneous contact during use.

Hyperkalemia associated with sulindac therapy.
Hyperkalemia has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAID) such as indomethacin. Several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of sulindac, owing to its lack of interference with renal prostacyclin synthesis. We describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6.1 to 6.9 mEq/l developed within 3 to 8 days of sulindac administration. In all of them normal serum potassium levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping sulindac. As no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly, this course of events is suggestive of a cause-and-effect relationship between sulindac and hyperkalemia. These observations indicate that initial hopes that sulindac may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other NSAID are probably not justified.

Hyperprolactinemia can reduce fertility and libido. Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen-induced LH surge. Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol. Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid-induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge. Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors (PRL-R) and components of prolactin's signaling pathway. To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL-R expression and sensitivity to prolactin, we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin-induced STAT5 activation. Lastly, we measured PRL-R and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1 and -3 and CIS, which reflect the level of prolactin signaling) mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol. Sulpiride induced only SOCS-1 in the medial preoptic area, where GnRH neurons are regulated, but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus, PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels were also induced. Estradiol enhanced these effects on SOCS-3 and CIS. Interestingly, estradiol also induced PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels independently. These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid-dependent manner. They also provide evidence for estradiol-dependent and brain region-specific regulation of PRL-R expression and signaling responses by prolactin.

Hypertension in neuroblastoma induced by imipramine.
Hypertension is a well-known finding in some patients with neuroblastoma. However, it has not previously been described in association with the use of Imipramine. We report the occurrence of severe hypertension (blood pressure 190/160) in a 4-year-old girl with neuroblastoma who was given Imipramine to control a behavior disorder. It was determined later that this patient's tumor was recurring at the time of her hypertensive episode. Since she had no blood pressure elevation at initial diagnosis and none following discontinuation of the Imipramine (when she was in florid relapse), we believe that this drug rather than her underlying disease alone caused her hypertension. The mechanism for this reaction is believed to be increased levels of vasoactive catecholamines due to interference of their physiologic inactivation by Imipramine. From this experience, we urge extreme caution in the use of tricyclic antidepressants in children with active neuroblastoma.
Hypertensive response during dobutamine stress echocardiography.
Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder, which is characterized by periodic attacks of muscle weakness associated with a decrease in the serum potassium level. A major disease-causing gene for HypoPP has been identified as CACNA1S, which encodes the skeletal muscle calcium channel alpha-subunit with four transmembrane domains (I-IV), each with six transmembrane segments (S1-S6). To date, all CACNA1S mutations identified in HypoPP patients are located within the voltage-sensor S4 segment. In this study we report a novel CACNA1S mutation in a new region of the protein, the S3 segment of domain III. We characterized a four-generation South American family with HypoPP. Genetic analysis identified a novel V876E mutation in all HypoPP patients in the family, but not in normal family members or 160 control people. Clinical analysis indicates that mutation V876E is associated with a severe outcome as characterized by a very early age of onset, complete penetrance and a severe prognosis including death. These results identify a new mutation in CACNA1S and expand the spectrum of CACNA1S mutations associated with HypoPP.
Hypokalemia, sometimes severe, was observed in some L-dopa-treated parkinsonian patients. The influence of L-dopa on the renal excretion of potassium was studied in 3 patients with hypokalemia and in 5 normokalemic patients by determination of renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, plasma concentration of potassium and sodium as well as urinary excretion of potassium, sodium and aldosterone. L-Dopa intake was found to cause an increased excretion of potassium, and sometimes also of sodium, in the hypokalemic but not in the normokalemic patients. This effect on the renal function could be prohibited by the administration of a peripheral dopa decarbodylase inhibitor. It is not known why this effect occurred in some individuals but not in others, but our results indicate a correlation between aldosterone production and this renal effect of L-dopa.

Hypoxanthine--guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) is a purine salvage enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate and guanine to guanosine monophosphate. Previous studies of mutant HPRT proteins analyzed at the molecular level have shown a significant heterogeneity. This investigation further verifies this heterogeneity and identifies insertions, deletions, and point mutations. The direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified product of reverse-transcribed HPRT mRNA enabled the rapid identification of the mutations found in 17 previously uncharacterized cell lines derived from patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome..
Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT; EC2. 4. 2. 8), which functions in the metabolic salvage of purines, is encoded by an X-linked gene in man. Partial HPRT deficiencies are associated with gouty arthritis, while absence of activity results in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (L-N). L-N patients fail to reproduce and the heterozygous state appears to confer no selective advantage. Thus, Haldanes principle predicts that new mutations at the hprt locus must occur frequently in order for L-N syndrome to be maintained in the population. This constant introduction of new mutations would be expected to result in a heterogeneous collection of genetic lesions, some of which may be novel. As we report here, the mutations in the hprt gene of seven L-N patients, selected from an initial survey of 28 patients, have been characterized and all were found to be distinctly different, as predicted. The origin of one unusual mutation has been identified by analysis of DNA from four generations of family members. Further molecular analysis of the origin of new mutations at the hprt locus should aid in resolving the issue of an apparent difference in the frequency of hprt mutations in males and females

IFI 16 is an interferon-inducible nucleoprotein expressed by human monocytes. IFI 16 and a related mouse protein, p202, control cellular proliferation by binding and modulating the functions of cell cycle regulatory factors including p53 and the retinoblastoma gene product, pRb. In this study, we examined IFI 16 expression in myeloid precursor cells cultured in vitro in colony-forming assays using granulocyte (G-) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-) colony-stimulating factor (CSF). IFI 16 was expressed in 100% of CD34+ cells isolated from human bone marrow. When the CD34+ cells were induced to differentiate, two sub-populations of cells were identified by two-color cytofluorography: the CD14+ (monocytoid) cells all expressed IFI 16, whereas the CD14- (polymorphonuclear precursor) cells did not. The strongest expression of IFI 16 was in the cells staining brightest for CD14, whereas depletion of CD14+ monocytoid cells from mixed monocytic/granulocytic cultures largely abolished IFI 16-stained cells. Furthermore, in eight independent colony-forming assays, the number of IFI 16+ cells correlated closely with the numbers of monocyte precursors identified morphologically (R2 = 0.99), but was unrelated to the numbers of myelocytes, promyelocytes, and metamyelocytes; nor was IFI 16 expressed by erythroid or eosinophil precursors. We conclude that IFI 16 is expressed in CD34+ and monocytoid daughter cells, but is rapidly and markedly down-regulated at the corresponding stages of polymorphonuclear and erythroid development. This differential expression of IFI 16 in myeloid precursor subpopulations and its perceived molecular properties are consistent with a possible role in regulating myelopoiesis.
IFN-induced protein of 10 kDa (IP-10), monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig), and IFN-inducible T-cell alpha-chemoattractant (I-TAC) belong to the non-glutamate-leucine-arginine motif CXC chemokine family and act solely through the CXCR3 receptor for potent attraction of T lymphocytes. In this study, we evaluated the capacity of the T cell-derived cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 to modulate IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC in cultured human keratinocytes and CXCR3 expression in T cells from allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). IL-4, but not IL-10 or IL-17, significantly up-regulated IFN-gamma- or TNF-alpha-induced IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC mRNA accumulation in keratinocytes and increased the levels of IP-10 and Mig in keratinocyte supernatants. Immunohistochemistry of skin affected by ACD revealed that >70% of infiltrating cells were reactive for CXCR3 and that CXCR3 staining colocalized in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Nickel-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lines established from ACD skin produced IFN-gamma and IL-4 and expressed moderate to high levels of CXCR3. Finally, CXCR3 agonistic chemokines released by stimulated keratinocytes triggered calcium mobilization in skin-derived nickel-specific CD4+ T cells and promoted their migration, with supernatant from keratinocyte cultures stimulated with IFN-gamma and IL-4 attracting more efficaciously than supernatant from keratinocytes activated with IFN-gamma alone. In conclusion, IL-4 exerts a proinflammatory function on keratinocytes by potentiating IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha induction of IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC, which in turn may determine a prominent recruitment of CXCR3+ T lymphocytes at inflammatory reaction sites.
IL-1 receptor antagonist attenuates MAP kinase/AP-1 activation and MMP1 expression in UVA-irradiated human fibroblasts induced by culture medium from UVB-irradiated human skin keratinocytes.
IL-10-related T cell-derived inducible factor (IL-TIF or IL-21) is a new cytokine structurally related to IL-10 and originally identified in the mouse as a gene induced by IL-9 in T cells and mast cells. Here, we report the cloning of the human IL-TIF cDNA, which shares 79% amino acid identity with mouse IL-TIF and 25% identity with human IL-10. Recombinant human IL-TIF was found to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription factors-1 and -3 in several hepatoma cell lines. IL-TIF stimulation of HepG2 human hepatoma cells up-regulated the production of acute phase reactants such as serum amyloid A, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and haptoglobin. Although IL-10 and IL-TIF have distinct activities, antibodies directed against the beta chain of the IL-10 receptor blocked the induction of acute phase reactants by IL-TIF, indicating that this chain is a common component of the IL-10 and IL-TIF receptors. Similar acute phase reactant induction was observed in mouse liver upon IL-TIF injection, and IL-TIF expression was found to be rapidly increased after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, suggesting that this cytokine contributes to the inflammatory response in vivo.
IL-17E, a novel proinflammatory ligand for the IL-17 receptor homolog IL-17Rh1.
IL-2 is the major autocrine and paracrine growth factor produced by T cells upon T cell stimulation. The inducible expression of IL-2 is highly regulated by multiple transcription factors, particularly AP-1, which coordinately activate the promoter. Described here is the ability of the novel basic leucine zipper protein p21SNFT to repress AP-1 activity and IL-2 transcription. A detailed analysis of the repression by p21SNFT repression on the IL-2 promoter distal NF-AT/AP-1 site demonstrates that it can bind DNA with NF-AT and Jun, strongly suggesting that it represses NF-AT/AP-1 activity by competing with Fos proteins for Jun dimerization. The importance of this repression is that p21SNFT inhibits the trans-activation potential of protein complexes that contain Jun, thereby demonstrating an additional level of control for the highly regulated, ubiquitous AP-1 transcription factor and the IL-2 gene.
IL-22 is an IL-10 homologue that binds to and signals through the class II cytokine receptor heterodimer IL-22RA1/CRF2-4. IL-22 is produced by T cells and induces the production of acute-phase reactants in vitro and in vivo, suggesting its involvement in inflammation. Here we report the identification of a class II cytokine receptor designated IL-22RA2 (IL-22 receptor-alpha 2) that appears to be a naturally expressed soluble receptor. IL-22RA2 shares amino acid sequence homology with IL-22RA1 (also known as IL-22R, zcytor11, and CRF2-9) and is physically adjacent to IL-20Ralpha and IFN-gammaR1 on chromosome 6q23.3-24.2. We demonstrate that IL-22RA2 binds specifically to IL-22 and neutralizes IL-22-induced proliferation of BaF3 cells expressing IL-22 receptor subunits. IL-22RA2 mRNA is highly expressed in placenta and spleen by Northern blotting. PCR analysis using RNA from various tissues and cell lines showed that IL-22RA2 was expressed in a range of tissues, including those in the digestive, female reproductive, and immune systems. In situ hybridization revealed the dominant cell types expressing IL-22RA2 were mononuclear cells and epithelium. Because IL-22 induces the expression of acute phase reactants, IL-22RA2 may play an important role as an IL-22 antagonist in the regulation of inflammatory responses.

IMPLICATIONS: This case documents a patient who developed dizziness with downbeating nystagmus while receiving a relatively large dose of IV patient-controlled analgesia morphine. Although there have been case reports of epidural morphine with these symptoms and signs, this has not been previously documented with IV or patient-controlled analgesia morphine.
IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Fluoropyrimidines, in particular 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), have been the mainstay of treatment for several solid tumors, including colorectal, breast and head and neck cancers, for > 40 years. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This article reviews the pharmacology and efficacy of capecitabine with a special emphasis on its safety. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader will gain better insight into the safety of capecitabine in special populations such as patients with advanced age, renal and kidney disease. We also explore different dosing and schedules of capecitabine administration. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-FU and was developed to fulfill the need for a more convenient therapy and provide an improved safety/efficacy profile. It has shown promising results alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in colorectal, breast, pancreaticobiliary, gastric, renal cell and head and neck cancers. The most commonly reported toxic effects of capecitabine are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome. Capecitabine has a well-established safety profile and can be given safely to patients with advanced age, hepatic and renal dysfunctions.
INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) significantly increases the morbidity and mortality of patients. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the protective effects of isotonic sodium chloride with sodium bicarbonate infusion and isotonic sodium chloride infusion with diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, in preventing CIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included patients who were administered 30-60 mL of iodinated contrast agent for percutaneous coronary angiography (PCAG), all with creatinine values between 1.1 and 3.1 mg/dL. Patients were divided into three groups and each group had 20 patients. The first group of patients was administered isotonic sodium chloride; the second group was administered a solution that of 5% dextrose and sodium bicarbonate, while the third group was administered isotonic sodium chloride before and after the contrast injection. The third group received an additional injection of diltiazem the day before and first 2 days after the contrast injection. All of the patients' plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels were measured on the second and seventh day after the administration of intravenous contrast material. RESULTS: The basal creatinine levels were similar for all three groups (p > 0.05). Among a total of 60 patients included in the study, 16 patients developed acute renal failure (ARF) on the second day after contrast material was injected (26.6%). The number of patients who developed ARF on the second day after the injection in the first group was five (25%), in the second group was six (30%) and the third group was five (25%) (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between isotonic sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and isotonic sodium chloride with diltiazem application in prevention of CIN.
INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 7% of hospitalized and 66% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. It increases mortality, hospital length of stay, and costs. The aim of this study was to investigate, whether there is an association between adherence to guidelines (standard operating procedures (SOP)) for potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics and the occurrence of AKI. METHODS: This study was carried out as a prospective, clinical, non-interventional, observational study. Data collection was performed over a total of 170 days in three ICUs at Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin. A total of 675 patients were included; 163 of these had therapy with vancomycin, gentamicin, or tobramycin; were >18 years; and treated in the ICU for >24 hours. Patients with an adherence to SOP >70% were classified into the high adherence group (HAG) and patients with an adherence of <70% into the low adherence group (LAG). AKI was defined according to RIFLE criteria. Adherence to SOPs was evaluated by retrospective expert audit. Development of AKI was compared between groups with exact Chi2-test and multivariate logistic regression analysis (two-sided P <0.05). RESULTS: LAG consisted of 75 patients (46%) versus 88 HAG patients (54%). AKI occurred significantly more often in LAG with 36% versus 21% in HAG (P = 0.035). Basic characteristics were comparable, except an increased rate of soft tissue infections in LAG. Multivariate analysis revealed an odds ratio of 2.5-fold for LAG to develop AKI compared with HAG (95% confidence interval 1.195 to 5.124, P = 0.039). CONCLUSION: Low adherence to SOPs for potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics was associated with a higher occurrence of AKI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN54598675.

INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic-associated hepatotoxicity is rare. With widespread use of antimicrobial agents, however, hepatic injury occurs frequently, and among adverse drug reactions, idiosyncratic reactions are the most serious. CASE SUMMARY: A 25-year-old male patient, with a height of 175 cm and weight of 72 kg presented to Marmara University Hospital Emergency Department, Istanbul, Turkey, with 5 days' history of jaundice, malaise, nausea, and vomiting. He had been prescribed telithromycin 400 mg/d PO to treat an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days prior. Admission laboratory tests were as follows: alanine aminotransferase, 67 U/L (reference range, 10-37 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 98 U/L (10-40 U/L); alkaline phosphatase, 513 U/L (0-270 U/L); gamma-glutamyltransferase, 32 U/L (7-49 U/L); amylase, 46 U/L (0-220 U/L); total bilirubin, 20.1 mg/dL (0.2-1.0 mg/dL); direct bilirubin, 14.8 mg/dL (0-0.3 mg/dL); and albumin, 4.7 mg/dL (3.5-5.4 mg/dL). No toxin, alcohol, or other drugs were reported. The patient had suffered a previous episode of "acute hepatitis of unknown origin," that occurred after telithromycin usage. Both incidents occurred within a year. DISCUSSION: Telithromycin is the first of the ketolide antibacterials to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use. It has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe hepatic dysfunction. Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, telithromycin was the probable cause of acute hepatitis in this patient, and pathological findings suggested drug-induced toxic hepatitis. Recurrence of hepatitis attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed telithromycin the second time. CONCLUSION: Here we report a case of acute hepatitis probably associated with the administration of telithromycin.
INTRODUCTION: Cocaine use has been associated with neurovascular complications, including arterial vasoconstriction and vasculitis. However, there are few studies of angiographic effects of cocaine on human cerebral arteries. Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with cocaine-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who underwent angiography shortly after cocaine use. METHODS: We screened patients with SAH retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for cocaine or its metabolites. Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with SAH who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter. Qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with positive cocaine toxicology were compared to 26 controls. There were no significant differences between groups in the mean diameters of the intradural internal carotid, sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral, precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral, or basilar arteries (p greater than 0.05 for all comparisons, unpaired t-tests). There also were no significant differences between groups when expressing diameters as the sum of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral + sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral + supraclinoid internal carotid artery + basilar artery divided by the diameter of the petrous internal carotid artery (p greater than 0.05, unpaired t-tests). Qualitative assessments showed two arterial irregularities in the distal vasculature in each group. CONCLUSION: No quantitative evidence for narrowing of large cerebral arteries or qualitative angiographic evidence for distal narrowing or vasculitis could be found in patients who underwent angiography after aneurysmal SAH associated with cocaine use.
INTRODUCTION: Confusion is an adverse drug reaction frequently observed with valproic acid. Some case reports are published in the literature but no systematic study from a sample of patients has been published. We performed this study in order to describe the main characteristics of this adverse drug reaction. METHODS: Using the French Pharmacovigilance database, we selected the cases of confusion reported since 1985 with valproic acid. RESULTS: 272 cases of confusion were reported with valproic acid: 153 women and 119 men. Confusion mostly occurred during the two first weeks following valproic acid exposure (39.7%). It was "serious" for almost 2/3 of the patients (62.5%) and its outcome favourable in most of the cases (82%). The occurrence of this ADR was more frequent in patients aged between 61 and 80 years. CONCLUSION: This work shows that confusion with valproic acid is a serious, rather frequent but reversible adverse drug reaction. It occurs especially in older patients and during the first two weeks of treatment.
INTRODUCTION: Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens. In high doses, its nonhematological dose-limiting toxicity is cardiomyopathy. STUDY DESIGN: We combined paclitaxel, melphalan and high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin in a triple sequential high-dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy-responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96-h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high-dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure (CHF) and the following pretreatment characteristics: presence of electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, age, hypertension, prior cardiac history, smoking, diabetes mellitus, prior use of anthracyclines, and left-sided chest irradiation. RESULTS: Six of 61 women (10%) developed clinically reversible grade 3 CHF following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31%. Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide-related cardiac toxicity (10%) is comparable to previous recorded literature. Older age was significantly correlated with the CHF development; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing CHF of 45 and 59, respectively. No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of these findings, oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients. Routine EKG monitoring during infusional cyclophosphamide did not predict CHF development.
INTRODUCTION: Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP 1A2) is responsible for more than 90% of caffeine clearance. A polymorphic variant of CYP1A2 (-163C>A) (rs762551) is associated with high CYP1A2 inducibility. Both caffeine and its main metabolite, paraxanthine, may be neuroprotective. The association between caffeine intake and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in fast and slow caffeine metabolizers has not been compared. OBJECTIVE: In a case-control study, we analyzed the relationship between caffeine intake and risk of PD in both fast and slow caffeine metabolizers. METHODS: All the study participants were recruited prospectively, and interviewed for information on the amount and duration of caffeine intake. Genotyping of the CYP1A2 variant was carried out using the allelic discrimination method. RESULTS: Out of 1000 participants who were initially screened, 886 consisting of 418 PD and 468 race, sex and age matched controls were included. No evidence existed to suggest any association between CYP1A2 and the onset of PD (P=0.08). A significant association was seen between caffeine intake and the onset of PD (P=2.01x10(-5)), with the odds ratio for moderate and high drinkers at 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50-1.00] and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.34-0.65), respectively against the low drinkers. Multivariate analysis revealed no evidence of any interaction effects of caffeine with CYP1A2 (P=0.956). CONCLUSION: The association between caffeine intake and risk of PD was similarly observed in both fast and slow caffeine metabolizers, supporting experimental evidence in animal models that both caffeine and its major metabolite, paraxanthine, are neuroprotective.
INTRODUCTION: Diazinon Yis one of the most broadly used organophosphorus insecticides in agriculture. It has been shown that exposure to diazinon may interfere with lipid metabolism. Moreover, the hypolipidemic effect of crocin has been established. Earlier studies revealed the major role of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) expression. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the regulation of lipid metabolism, ERK and LDLr expression in the liver of rats exposed to subacute diazinon. Furthermore ameliorating effect of crocin on diazinon induced disturbed cholesterol homeostasis was studied. METHODS: 24 Rats were divided into 4 groups and received following treatments for 4 weeks; Corn oil (control), diazinon (15mg/kg per day, orally) and crocin (12.5 and 25mg/kg per day, intraperitoneally) in combination with diazinon (15 mg/kg). The levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL in blood of rats were analyzed. Moreover mRNA levels of LDLr and ERK1/2 as well as protein levels of total and activated forms of ERK1/2 in rat liver were evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: Our data showed that subacute exposure to diazinon significantly increased concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL. Moreover diazinon decreased ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation and LDLr transcript. Crocin reduced inhibition of ERK activation and diazinon-induced hyperlipemia and increased levels of LDLr transcript. CONCLUSIONS: Crocin may be considered as a novel protective agent in diazinon-induced hyperlipemia through modulating of ERK pathway and increase of LDLr expression.
INTRODUCTION: Ethambutol is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia, and can be associated with permanent visual loss. We report 3 cases which presented with bitemporal hemianopia. CLINICAL PICTURE: Three patients with ethambutol-associated toxic optic neuropathy are described. All 3 patients had loss of central visual acuity, colour vision (Ishihara) and visual field. The visual field loss had a bitemporal flavour, suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm. TREATMENT: Despite stopping ethambutol on diagnosis, visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months. Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases. In the third case, visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale. OUTCOME: All 3 patients had some permanent loss of visual function. CONCLUSIONS: Ethambutol usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow-up. The author postulates that in cases of ethambutol associated chiasmopathy, ethambutol may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm.
INTRODUCTION: Intoxications with carbachol, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist are rare. We report an interesting case investigating a (near) fatal poisoning. METHODS: The son of an 84-year-old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in Alzheimer's disease. The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound 'carbamylcholin'; that is, carbachol. He bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy, and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg. Carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Minutes after oral administration, the patient developed nausea, sweating and hypotension, and finally collapsed. Bradycardia, cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred. Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline (epinephrine), atropine and furosemide was successful. On hospital admission, blood pressure of the intubated, bradyarrhythmic patient was 100/65 mmHg. Further signs were hyperhidrosis, hypersalivation, bronchorrhoea, and severe miosis; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio-ventricular dissociation. High doses of atropine (up to 50 mg per 24 hours), adrenaline and dopamine were necessary. The patient was extubated 1 week later. However, increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation. Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction. One week later, the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward. On the next day he died, probably as a result of heart failure. Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3.6 and 1.9 mg/l carbachol, respectively. The corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg/l. CONCLUSION: This case started with a media report in a popular newspaper, initiated by published, peer-reviewed research on herbals, and involved human failure in a case history, medical examination and clinical treatment. For the first time, an analytical method for the determination of carbachol in plasma and urine has been developed. The analysed carbachol concentration exceeded the supposed serum level resulting from a therapeutic dose by a factor of 130 to 260. Especially in old patients, intensivists should consider intoxications (with cholinergics) as a cause of acute cardiovascular failure.
INTRODUCTION: Many substances that form methemoglobin (MHb) effectively counter cyanide (CN) toxicity. Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN poisoning, it has been proposed that a stable, long-acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment. Using this rationale, the 8-aminoquinoline WR242511, a potent long-lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs, was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment. METHODS: In this study, WR242511 was administered intravenously (IV) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3.5 and/or 7.0 mg/kg; a single male also received WR242511 orally (PO) at 7.0 mg/kg. Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure. RESULTS: The selected doses of WR242511, which produced significant methemoglobinemia in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere, produced very little MHb (mean < 2.0%) in the rhesus monkey. Furthermore, transient hemoglobinuria was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of WR242511 (3.5 or 7.0 mg/kg), and 2 lethalities occurred (one IV and one PO) following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. Myoglobinuria was also observed following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed liver and kidney toxicity, with greater severity in the orally-treated animal. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate direct and/or indirect drug-induced toxicity. It is concluded that WR242511 should not be pursued as a pretreatment for CN poisoning unless the anti-CN characteristics of this compound can be successfully dissociated from those producing undesirable toxicity.
INTRODUCTION: Mutations in the genes encoding collagen VI (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) cause Bethlem myopathy (BM) and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD). BM is a relatively mild dominantly inherited disorder with proximal weakness and distal joint contractures. UCMD is an autosomal recessive condition causing severe muscle weakness with proximal joint contractures and distal hyperlaxity. METHODS: We developed a method for rapid direct sequence analysis of all 107 coding exons of the COL6 genes using single condition amplification/internal primer (SCAIP) sequencing. We have sequenced all three COL6 genes from genomic DNA in 79 patients with UCMD or BM. RESULTS: We found putative mutations in one of the COL6 genes in 62% of patients. This more than doubles the number of identified COL6 mutations. Most of these changes are consistent with straightforward autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance. However, some patients showed changes in more than one of the COL6 genes, and our results suggest that some UCMD patients may have dominantly acting mutations rather than recessive disease. DISCUSSION: Our findings may explain some or all of the cases of UCMD that are unlinked to the COL6 loci under a recessive model. The large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms which we generated in the course of this work may be of importance in determining the major phenotypic variability seen in this group of disorders.
INTRODUCTION: The CYP2E1 enzyme is responsible for the metabolic activation of several procarcinogens into reactive metabolites that result in carcinogenesis. The genetic polymorphisms that modify these enzymatic activities may be associated with upper aerodigestive tract cancer risk. METHODS: This hospital-based study evaluated CYP2E1*1B, CYP2E1*5B and CYP2E1*6 polymorphisms in 408 histopathologically confirmed cases and 220 population-based controls using PCR-RFLP methods. RESULTS: The multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated no significant differences between groups for all three polymorphisms when analyzed separately. However, the gene-environment interactions analyses revealed significant interactions among tobacco smokers (11-20 pack years), 20-40 pack years and > 40 pack years), regular tobacco chewers and alcoholics carrying CYP2E1*1B mutant genotypes. Similarly, CYP2E1*6 polymorphisms resulted in significant interactions among tobacco smokers (> 40 pack years) and regular tobacco chewers on the multiplicative scale. CONCLUSION: The significant gene-environment interactions observed for CYP2E1*1B and CYP2E1*6 polymorphic genotypes may confer a substantial risk for upper aerodigestive tract cancers among Indians.
INTRODUCTION: The ability to read facial expressions is essential for normal human social interaction. The aim of the present study was to conduct the first investigation of facial expression recognition performance in recreational cocaine users. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups, comprised of 21 cocaine naive participants (CN), 30 occasional cocaine (OC), and 48 regular recreational cocaine (RC) users, were compared. An emotional facial expression (EFE) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions (happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust) was administered. Mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were derived. Participants were also assessed with the "Eyes task" to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the Symptom CheckList-90-Revised to measure psychopathology. RESULTS: There were no group differences in psychopathology or "eyes task" performance, but the RC group, who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the OC group, exhibited impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to the OC and CN groups. The RC group also correctly identified anger, fear, happiness, and surprise, more slowly than CN, but not OC participants. The OC group was slower than CN when correctly identifying disgust. The selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy manifested by the RC group cannot be explained by the subacute effects of cocaine, or ecstasy, because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impaired. Possible parallels between RC users and psychopaths with respect to impaired fear recognition, amygdala dysfunction, and etiology are discussed.
INTRODUCTION: The possible anxiogenic effects of fluoroquinolones, namely ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, were investigated in adult Charles Foster albino rats of either sex, weighing 150-200 g. METHODS: The drugs were given orally, in doses of 50 mg/kg for five consecutive days and the experiments were performed on the fifth day. The tests included open-field exploratory behaviour, elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze, social interaction and novelty-suppressed feeding latency behaviour. RESULTS: The results indicate that ciprofloxacin- and norfloxacin-treated rats showed anxious behaviour in comparison to control rats in all the parameters studied. However, ciprofloxacin- and norfloxacin-treated rats did not differ significantly from each other in various behavioural parameters. CONCLUSION: The present experimental findings substantiate the clinically observed anxiogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin.

Identification of the FMR1 gene and the repeat-amplification mechanism causing fragile X syndrome led to development of reliable DNA-based diagnostic methods, including Southern blot hybridization and PCR. Both methods are performed on DNA isolated from peripheral blood cells and measure the repeat size in FMR1. Using an immunocytochemical technique on blood smears, we recently developed a novel test for identification of patients with fragile X syndrome. This method, also called " antibody test, " uses monoclonal antibodies against the FMR1 gene product (FMRP) and is based on absence of FMRP in patients cells. Here we describe a new diagnostic test to identify male patients with fragile X syndrome, on the basis of lack of FMRP in their hair roots. Expression of FMRP in hair roots was studied by use of an FMRP-specific antibody test, and the percentage of FMRP-expressing hair roots in controls and in male fragile X patients was determined. Control individuals showed clear expression of FMRP in nearly every hair root, whereas male fragile X patients lacked expression of FMRP in almost all their hair roots. Mentally retarded female patients with a full mutation showed FMRP expression in only some of their hair roots (< 55%), and no overlap with normal female controls was observed. The advantages of this test are (1) plucking of hair follicles does no appreciable harm to the mentally retarded patient, (2) hairs can be sent in a simple envelope to a diagnostic center, and (3) the result of the test is available within 5 h of plucking. In addition, this test enabled us to identify two fragile X patients who did not show the full mutation by analysis of DNA isolated from blood cells..

Idiopathic subjective tinnitus (IST) is one of the most obscure otological pathologies. This paper presents the results of treating IST by intratympanic instillation of lignocaine (lidocaine) 2 per cent through a grommet, for five weekly courses. Fifty-two patients suffering from intractable tinnitus entered this therapeutic trial, but only nine finished all five courses. In one patient, the tinnitus was almost completely abolished, but in all the nine patients the decompensated tinnitus changed to a compensated one. We suggest this mode of treatment for patients that were previously treated by drugs, acupuncture and biofeedback, with disappointing results. Patients should be warned about the side effects of vertigo and vomiting, which subsides gradually with every new instillation, and that the tinnitus may not disappear but will be alleviated, enabling them to cope more easily with the disease and lead a more normal life.
If untreated, hemochromatosis can cause serious illness and early death, but the disease is still substantially under-diagnosed. The cornerstone of screening and case detection is the measurement of serum transferrin saturation and the serum ferritin level. Once the diagnosis is suspected, physicians must use serum ferritin levels and hepatic iron stores on liver biopsy specimens to assess patients for the presence of iron overload. Liver biopsy is also used to establish the presence or absence of cirrhosis, which can affect prognosis and management. A DNA-based test for the HFE gene is commercially available, but its place in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis is still being evaluated. Currently, the most useful role for this test is in the detection of hemochromatosis in the family members of patients with a proven case of the disease. It is crucial to diagnose hemochromatosis before hepatic cirrhosis develops because phlebotomy therapy can avert serious chronic disease and can even lead to normal life expectancy..
Ifosfamide (IFO) is an alkylating nitrogen mustard, administrated as an antineoplasmic agent. It is characterized by its intense urotoxic action, leading to hemorrhagic cystitis. This side effect of IFO raises the requirement for the co-administration with sodium 2-sulfanylethanesulfonate (Mesna) aiming to avoid or minimize this effect. IFO and Mesna were administrated separately on rabbit's lymphocytes in vivo, which were later developed in vitro. Cytogenetic markers for sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), proliferation rate index (PRI) and Mitotic Index were recorded. Mesna's action, in conjunction with IFO reduces the frequency of SCEs, in comparison with the SCEs recordings obtained when IFO is administered alone. In addition to this, when high concentrations of Mesna were administered alone significant reductions of the PRI were noted, than with IFO acting at the same concentration on the lymphocytes. Mesna significantly reduces IFO's genotoxicity, while when administered in high concentrations it acts in an inhibitory fashion on the cytostatic action of the drug.

IgA, the predominant isotype in secretions, mediates the neutralization and removal of environmental antigens from mucosal sites. Although cell surface receptors for the Fc region of IgA (Fc alpha R) have been implicated in a variety of immune effector mechanisms, the molecular features of Fc alpha R remain only marginally characterized. In this report, we describe the isolation of a clone from a myeloid cell line cDNA library that directs the expression of a cell surface molecule with IgA binding specificity. The cDNA encodes a peptide of Mr 30,000 including a putative transmembrane region with features atypical of conventional membrane-anchored proteins. Databank searches indicate that the human myeloid cell Fc alpha R sequence is unique, is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, and is related to Fc receptors for IgG (Fc gamma RI, II, and III) and IgE (Fc epsilon RI).

Immune escape variants of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) represent an emerging clinical challenge, because they can be associated with vaccine escape, HBV reactivation, and failure of diagnostic tests. Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals. We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants, the sG145R and sP120T mutants, on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment-associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine (LAM) and/or HBeAg negativity. Replication-competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120T and LAM resistance (rtM204I or rtL180M/rtM204V) were generated on an HBeAg-positive and an HBeAg-negative background with precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutants. The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of LAM-resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild-type HBV, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication. Although the sP120T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion, it did not enhance the replication of LAM-resistant clones. However, the concomitant occurrence of HBeAg negativity (PC/BCP), sP120T, and LAM resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild-type HBV. In all clones with combined immune escape and LAM resistance mutations, the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro. These findings reveal the differential impact of immune escape variants on the replication and drug susceptibility of complex HBV mutants, supporting the need of close surveillance and treatment adjustment in response to the selection of distinct mutational patterns.
Immune hemolytic anemia due to a drug-adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins. We describe a patient who developed anemia while receiving intravenous cefotetan. Cefotetan-dependent antibodies were detected in the patient's serum and in an eluate prepared from his red blood cells. The eluate also reacted weakly with red blood cells in the absence of cefotetan, suggesting the concomitant formation of warm-reactive autoantibodies. These observations, in conjunction with clinical and laboratory evidence of extravascular hemolysis, are consistent with drug-induced hemolytic anemia, possibly involving both drug-adsorption and autoantibody formation mechanisms. This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of hemolytic reactions to all cephalosporins.
Immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine alterations in the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in bladder pathways following acute and chronic irritation of the urinary tract of the rat. Chemical cystitis was induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP) which is metabolized to acrolein, an irritant eliminated in the urine. Injection of CYP (n = 10, 75 mg/kg, i.p.) 2 hours prior to perfusion (acute treatment) of the animals increased Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) in neurons in the dorsal commissure, dorsal horn, and autonomic regions of spinal segments (L1-L2 and L6-S1) which receive afferent inputs from the bladder, urethra, and ureter. Fos-IR in the spinal cord was not changed in rats receiving chronic CYP treatment (n = 15, 75 mg/kg, i.p., every 3rd day for 2 weeks). In control animals and in animals treated acutely with CYP, only small numbers of NOS-IR cells (0.5-0.7 cell profiles/sections) were detected in the L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Chronic CYP administration significantly (P < or = .002) increased bladder weight by 60% and increased (7- to 11-fold) the numbers of NOS-immunoreactive (IR) afferent neurons in the L6-S1 DRG. A small increase (1.5-fold) also occurred in the L1 DRG, but no change was detected in the L2 and L5 DRG. Bladder afferent cells in the L6-S1 DRG labeled by Fluorogold (40 microliters) injected into the bladder wall did not exhibit NOS-IR in control animals; however, following chronic CYP administration, a significant percentage of bladder afferent neurons were NOS-IR: L6 (19.8 +/- 4.6%) and S1 (25.3 +/- 2.9%). These results indicate that neuronal gene expression in visceral sensory pathways can be upregulated by chemical irritation of afferent receptors in the urinary tract and/or that pathological changes in the urinary tract can initiate chemical signals that alter the chemical properties of visceral afferent neurons.
Immunogenetic analysis of a homozygous C2-deficient individual and family members demonstrated linkage of HLA-A25, B18 and C2o. HLA-D typing showed that 5 members typed with homozygous Dw2 typing cells from an individual with C2 deficiency but not with Dw2 typing cells from 2 individuals with normal C2. The homozygous C2-deficient propositus and brother were HLA-A and B homozygous but heterozygous at the HLA-D and glyoxalase I loci. Therefore, in this family, the C2o gene is linked with two distinct haplotypes HLA-A25, B18, Dw2, GLO1 and HLA-A25, B18, D unknown, GL02. These results could be explained by an ancestral recombinant event, which occurred between the C2o locus and HLA-D locus in which C2o segregated with HLA-B. This would suggest that the locus for the C2o gene maps between HLA-B and HLA-D on the sixth chromosome..

Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against neurofilament (NF) proteins of middle and high molecular weight class, NF-M and NF-H, was used to study axonal injury in the borderzone of focal lesions in rats. Focal injury in the cortex was produced by infusion of lactate at acid pH or by stab caused by needle insertion. Infarcts in substantia nigra pars reticulata were evoked by prolonged pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Immunohistochemical staining for NFs showed characteristic terminal clubs of axons in the borderzone of lesions. Differences in the labelling pattern occurred with different antibodies which apparently depended on molecular weight class of NFs and phosphorylation state. These immunohistochemical changes of NFs can serve as a marker for axonal damage in various experimental traumatic or ischemic lesions.
Immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic terminal damage. In this study, we examined the roles of lipopolysaccharide, a pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factor, treatment in modulating the methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity. Lipopolysaccharide pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or methamphetamine-elicited hyperthermia three days later. Such systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment mitigated methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in a dose-dependent manner. As the most potent dose (1 mg/kg) of lipopolysaccharide was administered two weeks, one day before or after the methamphetamine dosing regimen, methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions remained unaltered. Moreover, systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment (1 mg/kg) attenuated local methamphetamine infusion-produced dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in the striatum, indicating that the protective effect of lipopolysaccharide is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of methamphetamine. We concluded a critical time window for systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment in exerting effective protection against methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity.

Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil (alkylating agents), azathioprine (purine analogue), and methotrexate (folic acid analogue). There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped. Since adverse reactions are frequent, less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year. Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects, those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it. Patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cyclophosphamide therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder. There have been several long-term studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and the incidence of most of the common cancers is not increased. Data on the possible increased risk of malignancy in rheumatoid arthritis are still being collected, and until further information is available, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly alkylating agents, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life-threatening complications.

Imprinting in the 15q11-q13 region involves an imprinting centre (IC), mapping in part to the promoter and first exon of SNRPN. Deletion of this IC abolishes local paternally derived gene expression and results in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We have created two deletion mutations in mice to understand PWS and the mechanism of this IC. Mice harbouring an intragenic deletion in Snrpn are phenotypically normal, suggesting that mutations of SNRPN are not sufficient to induce PWS. Mice with a larger deletion involving both Snrpn and the putative PWS-IC lack expression of the imprinted genes Zfp127 (mouse homologue of ZNF127), Ndn and Ipw, and manifest several phenotypes common to PWS infants. These data demonstrate that both the position of the IC and its role in the coordinate expression of genes is conserved between mouse and human, and indicate that the mouse is a suitable model system in which to investigate the molecular mechanisms of imprinting in this region of the genome..
Improved outcomes among patients with head and neck carcinomas require investigations of new drugs for induction therapy. Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single-agent paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) reported a 37% response rate in patients with head and neck cancer, and the paclitaxel/cisplatin combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in ovarian cancer patients. We initiated a phase I/II trial to determine the response and toxicity of escalating paclitaxel doses combined with fixed-dose cisplatin with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable head and neck carcinoma. To date, 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial. Primary tumor sites were oropharynx, 10 patients; hypopharynx, four; larynx, two; oral cavity, three; unknown primary, two; and nasal cavity and parotid gland, one each. Of 20 patients evaluable for toxicity, four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease. Treatment, given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles, consisted of paclitaxel by 3-hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of cisplatin (75 mg/m2). The dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses, and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits. At the time of this writing, dose level 4 (260, 270, and 280 mg/m2) is being evaluated; three patients from this level are evaluable. With paclitaxel doses of 200 mg/m2 and higher, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d is given (days 4 through 12). Of 18 patients evaluable for response, seven (39%) achieved a complete response and six (33%) achieved a partial response. Three patients had no change and disease progressed in two. The overall response rate is 72%. Eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery/radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy. Two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses. Alopecia, paresthesias, and arthralgias/myalgias have occurred frequently, but with one exception (a grade 3 myalgia) they have been grade 1 or 2. No dose-limiting hematologic toxicity has been seen. Paclitaxel/cisplatin is an effective first-line regimen for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer and continued study is warranted. Results thus far suggest no dose-response effect for paclitaxel doses above 200 mg/m2.

Improving glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment with radio-chemotherapy remains a challenge. Topotecan is an attractive option as it exhibits growth inhibition of human glioma as well as brain penetration. The present study assessed the combination of radiotherapy (60 Gy/30 fractions/40 days) and topotecan (0.9 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 on weeks 1, 3 and 5) in 50 adults with histologically proven and untreated GBM. The incidence of non-hematological toxicities was low and grade 3-4 hematological toxicities were reported in 20 patients (mainly lymphopenia and neutropenia). Partial response and stabilization rates were 2% and 32%, respectively, with an overall time to progression of 12 weeks. One-year overall survival (OS) rate was 42%, with a median OS of 40 weeks. Topotecan in combination with radiotherapy was well tolerated. However, while response and stabilization concerned one-third of the patients, the study did not show increased benefits in terms of survival in patients with unresectable GBM.
In 16 families with myotonic dystrophy (DM) a novel approach based on use of allele-specific oligonucleotides has been employed to study the linkage relationship between the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene and DM. Synthetic oligonucleotides, designed to discriminate between APOE alleles epsilon 3 and epsilon 4, enabled us to distinguish heterozygous carriers in a hybridization assay. In a subset of families, the relevant segment of the APOE gene was enzymatically amplified to increase the sensitivity of the method. For DM and APOE, a maximum lod score (zmax of 7. 47 was obtained at a recombination frequency (theta) of 0. 047 (male theta = female theta). No recombination (maximum lod score of 5. 61 at theta = 0. 0) was found between APOE and the apolipoprotein CII (APOC2) gene. These results suggest that, in addition to APOC2, APOE is a useful marker for presymptomatic DM diagnosis.
In 1992, Xie et al. identified a cDNA sequence in the expression cloning search for the kappa opioid receptor. When the cDNA was expressed in Cos-7 cells, binding of opioid compounds was observed to be of low affinity and without kappa, mu, or delta selectivity [Xie, G.-X., Miyajima, A. and Goldstein, A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 4124-4128]. This cDNA was highly homologous to the human neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptor sequence, and displayed lower homology to NK-1 and NK-2 sequences. This sequence was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express neurokinin receptors naturally, and ligand binding and second messenger characteristics were compared with a human NK-3 receptor. The NK-3 receptor homolog bound [3H] senktide with a Kd of 39 nM, similar to that of the NK-3 receptor. The rank order of tachykinin peptides competing for [3H]senktide binding at the NK-3 receptor homolog was [MePhe7]neurokinin B > senktide > substance P = neurokinin A > neurokinin B. This cell line also bound [125I-MePhe7]neurokinin B; however, neurokinin B was an effective competitor. Tachykinin peptides stimulated both inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and arachidonic acid release at NK-3 and NK-3 receptor homolog cell lines, with similar rank orders of potency of [MePhe7] neurokinin B = neurokinin B = senktide > NKA = substance P. These results indicate that expression of the NK-3 receptor homolog cDNA in the Chinese hamster ovary cell system induces the expression of a receptor site with many similarities but certain key differences from that of the human NK-3 receptor. The results are discussed with reference to the existence of a novel human tachykinin receptor.
In 2-8% of patients with mental retardation, small copy number changes in the subtelomeric region are thought to be the underlying cause. As detection of these genomic rearrangements is labour intensive using FISH, we constructed and validated a high-density BAC/PAC array covering the first 5 Mb of all subtelomeric regions and applied it in our routine screening of patients with idiopathic mental retardation for submicroscopic telomeric rearrangements. The present study shows the efficiency of this comprehensive subtelomere array in detecting terminal deletions and duplications but also small interstitial subtelomeric rearrangements, starting from small amounts of DNA. With our array, the size of the affected segments, at least those smaller than 5 Mb, can be determined simultaneously in the same experiment. In the first 100 patient samples analysed in our diagnostic practice by the use of this comprehensive telomere array, we found three patients with deletions in 3p, 10q and 15q, respectively, four patients with duplications in 9p, 12p, 21q and Xp, respectively, and one patient with a del 6q/dup 16q. The patients with del 3p and 10q and dup 12p had interstitial rearrangements that would have been missed with techniques using one probe per subtelomeric region chosen close to the telomere.
In 28 families with G6PD deficiency living in 3 settlements of Shekii district of Azerbaijan 11 G6PD variants of II and III classes differing by kinetic properties were identified according WHO program. 9 of them are characterized with the same electrophoretic mobility. Comparison of G6PD spectra in two subpopulations and in a mixed group permits to make a conclusion about existence of common and rare G6PD alleles in examined population. They distribute by gene drift supported by natural selection. Among 7 samples of G6PD with normal and increased activity two new variants of IV class -- Nukha and Bash-Kungut -- were found..
In 35 patients (ages 20 to 86 yr) receiving cimetidine therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of cimetidine by high-pressure liquid chromatography and for creatinine. Cimetidine clearance decreased with age. The extrapolated 6-hr serum concentration of cimetidine per unit dose, after intravenous cimetidine, increased with age of the patients. The ratio of cimetidine clearance to creatinine clearance (Rc) averaged 4.8 +/- 2.0, indicating net tubular secretion for cimetidine. Rc seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of cimetidine, suggesting that secretion of cimetidine is a saturable process. There was only one case of dementia possibly due to cimetidine (with a drug level of 1.9 microgram/ml 6 hr after a dose) in a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had cimetidine levels above 1.25 microgram/ml. Thus, high cimetidine levels alone do not always induce dementia.
In 5 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone (MP) therapy (1 g daily for 2 or 3 consecutive days), a decline in pulse rate was observed, most pronounced on day 4. In one of the 5 patients the bradycardia was associated with complaints of substernal pressure. Reversal to normal heart rate was found on day 7. Electrocardiographic registrations showed sinus bradycardia in all cases. No significant changes in plasma concentrations of electrolytes were found. Careful observation of patients receiving high-dose MP is recommended. High-dose MP may be contraindicated in patients with known heart disease.
In 5-10% of patients, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) results from microdeletions that encompass the entire NF1 gene and a variable number of flanking genes. Two recurrent microdeletion types are found in most cases, with microdeletion breakpoints located in paralogous regions flanking NF1 (proximal NF1-REP-a and distal NF1-REP-c for the 1.4 Mb type-1 microdeletion, and SUZ12 and SUZ12P for the 1.2 Mb type-2 microdeletion). A more severe phenotype is usually associated with NF1 microdeletion patients than in those with intragenic mutations. We characterized NF1 microdeletions in 70 unrelated NF1 microdeleted patients using a high-resolution NF1 custom array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Genotype-phenotype correlations were studied in 58 of these microdeletion patients and compared to 389 patients with intragenic truncating NF1 mutations and phenotyped in the same standardized way. Our results confirmed in an unbiased manner the existence of a contiguous gene syndrome with a significantly higher incidence of learning disabilities and facial dysmorphism in microdeleted patients compared to patients with intragenic NF1 mutations. Microdeleted NF1 patients also showed a trend toward significance for childhood overgrowth. High-resolution array-CGH identified a new recurrent approximately 1.0 Mb microdeletion type, designated as type-3, with breakpoints in the paralogous regions middle NF1-REP-b and distal NF1-REP-c.
In 51 families with Wilson disease, we have studied DNA haplotypes of dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms (CA repeats) in the 13q14. 3 region, to examine these markers for association with the Wilson disease gene (WND). In addition to a marker (D13S133) described elsewhere, we have developed three new highly polymorphic markers (D13S314, D13S315, and D13S316) close to the WND locus. We have examined the distribution of marker alleles at the loci studied and have found that D13S314, D13S133, and D13S316 each show nonrandom distribution on chromosomes carrying the WND mutation. We have studied haplotypes of these three markers and have found that there are highly significant differences between WND and normal haplotypes in northern European families. These findings have important implications for mutation detection and molecular diagnosis in families with Wilson disease.
In Japan, a nationwide prevention program against mother-to-infant infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) started in 1985. This program consists of double screenings of pregnant women and prophylactic treatment to the infants born to both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive mothers. These infants are treated with two injections of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and at least three injections of plasma derived hepatitis B vaccine. We sent questionnaires about the numbers of each procedure or examination during nine months of investigation period to each local government in 1986 and 1987. 93.4% pregnant women had the chance to be examined for HBsAg, and the positive rate was 1.4 to 1.5%. The HBeAg positive rate in HBsAg positive was 23 to 26%. The HBsAg positive rate in neonates and in infants before two months were 3% and 2% respectively. Some problems may arise, because 27 to 30% of infants need the fourth vaccination in some restricted areas.
In Swedish families with hereditary prostate cancer, linkage to the HPC1 locus on chromosome 1q24-25 is restricted to families with early-onset prostate cancer.
In a 12-week controlled study ethopropazine was compared to benztropine in the treatment of parkinsonism induced by fluphenazine enanthate in 60 schizophrenic outpatients. Ethopropazine and benztropine were found to be equally effective in controlling parkinsonian symptoms and were as efficacious as procyclidine, their previous antiparkinsonian drug. However, benztropine treated patients had a significant increase in tardive dyskinesia compared to their condition during procyclindine treatment, and significantly more anxiety and depression than ethopropazine treated patients. This suggests that benztropine is not the anticholinergic drug of choice in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonian symptoms, because of its more toxic central and peripheral atropinic effect.
In a 38-year-old male patient suffering from a severe postzosteric trigeminal neuralgia, intravenous application of 10 mg biperiden lactate led to a long-lasting paradoxical reaction characterized by considerable bradycardia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. The heart rate was back to normal within 12 hours upon administration of orciprenaline under cardiac monitoring in an intensive care unit. Bradycardia induced by biperiden is attributed to the speed of injection and to a dose-related dual effect of atropine-like drugs on muscarine receptors.
In a 6-week double-blind parallel treatment study, dothiepin and amitriptyline were compared to placebo in the treatment of 33 depressed outpatients. Dothiepin and amitriptyline were equally effective in alleviating the symptoms of depressive illness, and both were significantly superior to placebo. The overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of blurred vision, dry mouth, and drowsiness were significantly less with dothiepin than with amitriptyline. Dothiepin also produced fewer CNS and cardiovascular effects. There were no clinically important changes in laboratory parameters. Dothiepin thus was found to be an effective antidepressant drug associated with fewer side effects than amitriptyline in the treatment of depressed outpatients.
In a South African girl of Xhosa stock with severe piebaldism and profound congenital sensorineural deafness we identified a novel missense substitution at a highly conserved residue in the intracellular kinase domain of the KIT proto-oncogene, R796G. Though auditory anomalies have been observed in mice with dominant white spotting (W) due to KIT mutations, deafness is not typical in human piebaldism. Thus, the occurrence of sensorineural deafness in this patient extends considerably the phenotypic range of piebaldism due to KIT gene mutation in humans and tightens the clinical similarity between piebaldism and the various forms of Waardenburg syndrome..
In a double blind, crossover study 6 h infusions of adrenaline (15 ng/kg/min; 1 ng = 5.458 pmol), noradrenaline (30 ng/kg/min; 1 ng = 5.911 pmol), and a 5% dextrose solution (5.4 ml/h), were given to ten healthy volunteers in random order 2 weeks apart. By means of intra-arterial ambulatory monitoring the haemodynamic effects were followed for 18 h after the infusions were stopped. Adrenaline, but not noradrenaline, caused a delayed and protracted pressor effect. Over the total postinfusion period systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were 6 (SEM 2)% and 7 (2)%, respectively, higher than after dextrose infusion (ANOVA, p less than 0.001). Thus, "stress" levels of adrenaline (230 pg/ml) for 6 h cause a delayed and protracted pressor effect. These findings are strong support for the adrenaline-hypertension hypothesis in man.
In a family with three siblings, one developed classical late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), fatal at age 5 years, with deficient arylsulfatase A (ARSA) activity and increased galactosylsulfatide (GS) excretion. The two other siblings, apparently healthy at 12 (1/2) and 15 years, respectively, and their father, apparently healthy as well, presented ARSA and GS values within the range of MLD patients. Mutation screening and sequence analysis disclosed the involvement of three different ARSA mutations being the molecular basis of intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity. The late infantile patient inherited from his mother the frequent 0-type mutation 459 + 1G > A, and from his father a novel, single basepair microdeletion of guanine at nucleotide 7 in exon 1 (7delG). The two clinically unaffected siblings carried the maternal mutation 459 + 1G > A and, on their paternal allele, a novel cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 2435 in exon 8, resulting in substitution of alanine 464 by valine (A464V). The fathers genotype thus was 7delG/A464V. Mutation A464V was not found in 18 unrelated MLD patients and 50 controls. A464V, although clearly modifying ARSA and GS levels, apparently bears little significance for clinical manifestation of MLD, mimicking the frequent ARSA pseudodeficiency allele. Our results demonstrate that in certain genetic conditions MLD-like ARSA and GS values need not be paralleled by clinical disease, a finding with serious diagnostic and prognostic implications. Moreover, further ARSA alleles functionally similar to A464V might exist which, together with 0-type mutations, may cause pathological ARSA and GS levels, but not clinical outbreak of the disease..
In a large pedigree with autosomal dominant aniridia, we found close linkage between the aniridia locus AN2 and the markers catalase (CAT) (zeta = 7. 27 at theta = 0. 00) and D11S151 (zeta = 3. 86 at theta = 0. 10) flanking the AN2 locus on 11p13. Positive lod scores were also obtained for the 11p13----11p14 markers D11S16 and FSHB with the linkage group CAT/AN2/D11S151. We conclude that the autosomal dominant aniridia in this family is due to a mutation at the AN2 locus on 11p13. We have excluded linkage (zeta less than -2 at theta less than 0. 18) between the aniridia and the chromosome 2p25 marker D2S1 (linked to ACP1).
In a patient with WPW syndrome and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, intractable atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) was iatrogenically induced. QRS without preexcitation, caused by junctional escape beats after verapamil or unidirectional antegrade block of accessory pathway after catheter ablation, established frequent AVRT attack.
In a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) given as a 3-hour infusion in combination with carboplatin administered every 21 days to women with advanced ovarian cancer, paclitaxel doses were escalated as follows: level 1, 135 mg/m2; level 2, 160 mg/m2; level 3, 185 mg/m2; and level 4,210 mg/m2. The fixed dose of carboplatin at levels 1 through 4 was given to achieve an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5 using the Calvert formula. In levels 5 and 6 the carboplatin dose was targeted at AUCs of 6 and 7.5, respectively, combined with a fixed paclitaxel dose of 185 mg/m2. To date, 30 previously untreated patients, all with a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2) have been entered into this ongoing study. The dose-limiting toxicity of the combination was myelosuppression (leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia). Neurotoxicity was largely moderate. So far, 14 patients are evaluable for response; of these, eight (57%) showed objective (complete or partial) response and disease stabilized in six patients. No patient had disease progression. We conclude that the combination of paclitaxel 185 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour infusion followed immediately by a 1-hour infusion of carboplatin at an AUC of 6 can be administered safely in a 21-day schedule in the outpatient setting. The recommended dose for phase III studies is paclitaxel 185 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6.
In a placebo-controlled, single-blinded, crossover study, we assessed the effect of "real" repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) versus "sham" rTMS (placebo) on peak dose dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Ten patients with PD and prominent dyskinesias had rTMS (1,800 pulses; 1 Hz rate) delivered over the motor cortex for 4 consecutive days twice, once real stimuli and once sham stimulation were used; evaluations were done at the baseline and 1 day after the end of each of the treatment series. Direct comparison between sham and real rTMS effects showed no significant difference in clinician-assessed dyskinesia severity. However, comparison with the baseline showed small but significant reduction in dyskinesia severity following real rTMS but not placebo. The major effect was on dystonia subscore. Similarly, in patient diaries, although both treatments caused reduction in subjective dyskinesia scores during the days of intervention, the effect was sustained for 3 days after the intervention for the real rTMS only. Following rTMS, no side effects and no adverse effects on motor function and PD symptoms were noted. The results suggest the existence of residual beneficial clinical aftereffects of consecutive daily applications of low-frequency rTMS on dyskinesias in PD. The effects may be further exploited for potential therapeutic uses.
In a previous large-scale screening for differentially expressed genes in pancreatic cancer, a gene was identified that was highly overexpressed in pancreatic cancer encoding a novel putative tetraspan transmembrane protein highly homologous to the tumour-associated antigen L6. Using a radiation hybrid panel the identified human gene named TM4SF5 (transmembrane 4 superfamily member 5) was localized to chromosome 17 in the region 17p13.3. The cloned TM4SF5 cDNA has a 32bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a 591bp open reading frame (ORF) and a 85bp 3'UTR. The predicted TM4SF5 protein with 197 amino acids contains three NH2-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane regions, followed by an extracellular hydrophilic domain containing two potential N-linked glycosylation sites and a COOH-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane region. These structural features are shared by the L6 antigen and a number of related cell surface proteins associated with cell growth. TM4SF5 was overexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissues as compared to both normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis tissues, and was detected at high levels in other tumour tissues. Although the precise function of TM4SF5 remains to be elucidated it may be useful in a clinical setting for tumour diagnosis and/or therapy. This hypothesis is supported by the strong homology to the L6 antigen, which has proved promising in immunological, therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.
In a previous study we found that a Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) causing mutation in the intron 9 donor splice site of the HEXA gene occurs at high frequency in non-Jewish patients and carriers from the British Isles. It was found more frequently in subjects of Irish, Scottish, and Welsh origin compared with English origin (63% and 31% respectively). We have now tested, in a blind study, 26 American TSD carriers and 28 non-carriers who have British ancestry for the intron 9 splice site mutation. Six of the carriers and none of the controls were positive for the mutation. All six had Irish ancestry, compared with nine of the 20 other (intron 9 mutation negative) TSD carriers (p < 0. 05). These results confirm the previously found high frequency of the intron 9 mutation in non-Jewish TSD families of British Isles, particularly Irish, origin, and reinforce the need to screen such families for this mutation.
In a randomized study, labetalol-induced hypotension and nitroprusside-induced hypotension were compared in 20 patients (10 in each group) scheduled for major orthopedic procedures. Each patient was subjected to an identical anesthetic protocol and similar drug-induced reductions in mean arterial blood pressure (BP) (50 to 55 mmHg). Nitroprusside infusion was associated with a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in heart rate and cardiac output; rebound hypertension was observed in three patients after discontinuation of nitroprusside. Labetalol administration was not associated with any of these findings. Arterial PO2 decreased in both groups. It was concluded that labetalol offers advantages over nitroprusside.
In a search for candidate tumor suppressor genes within a 650-kb common region of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 16q24.3 in breast cancer tissues, a 2.6-kb cDNA, named copine VII (CPNE7), was characterized. The gene is 2654 bp and codes for a 633-residue protein with high homology to the other members of the copine family, such as copine I, copine III, and N-copine. The predicted amino acid sequence contains two copies of a C2 domain in the N-terminus. Since these domains have been found in several membrane-binding proteins involved in different intracellular processes, copine VII was viewed as a potential tumor suppressor gene. Mutation analysis was carried out by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of 18 breast tumor tissue samples with ascertained LOH on chromosome 16q24.3. Since only two polymorphisms were identified, no evidence was found to indicate that copine VII is the tumor suppressor gene at 16q24.3 involved in breast cancer. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.
In a series of five experiments, the modulating role of naloxone on a scopolamine-induced retention deficit in a passive avoidance paradigm was investigated in mice. Scopolamine, but not methyl scopolamine (1 and 3 mg/kg), induced an amnesia as measured by latency and duration parameters. Naloxone (0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) injected prior to training attenuated the retention deficit with a peak of activity at 3 mg/kg. The effect of naloxone could be antagonized with morphine (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg), demonstrating the opioid specificity of the naloxone effect. Post-training administration of naloxone (3 mg/kg) as a single or as a split dose also attenuated the scopolamine-induced amnesia. Control experiments indicated that neither an increase in pain sensitivity (pre-training naloxone) nor an induced aversive state (post-training naloxone) appear to be responsible for the influence of naloxone on the scopolamine-induced retention deficit. These results extend previous findings implicating a cholinergic-opioid interaction in memory processes. A possible mechanism for this interaction involving the septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway is discussed.
In acute pain models, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists enhance the antinociceptive effects of morphine to a greater extent in males than females. The purpose of this investigation was to extend these findings to a persistent pain model which could be distinguished from acute pain models on the basis of the nociceptive fibers activated, neurochemical substrates, and duration of the nociceptive stimulus. To this end, persistent hyperalgesia was induced by administration of capsaicin in the tail of gonadally intact F344 rats, following which the tail was immersed in a mildly noxious thermal stimulus, and tail-withdrawal latencies measured. For comparison, tests were conducted in two acute pain models, the hotplate and warm water tail-withdrawal procedures. In males, the non-competitive NMDA antagonist dextromethorphan enhanced the antihyperalgesic effect of low to moderate doses of morphine in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Across the doses and pretreatment times examined, enhancement was not observed in females. Enhancement of morphine antinociception by dextromethorphan was seen in both males and females in the acute pain models, with the magnitude of this effect being greater in males. These findings demonstrate a sexually-dimorphic interaction between NMDA antagonists and morphine in a persistent pain model that can be distinguished from those observed in acute pain models.
In addition to its use as a stabilizer/rigidifier of membranes, cholesteryl hemisuccinate, tris salt (CS) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the hepatotoxic effects of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of CS, gamma-cholesteryloxybutyric acid, tris salt (CSE) against acetaminophen-, adriamycin-, carbon tetrachloride-, chloroform- and galactosamine-induced toxicity. The results of these studies demonstrated that CS-mediated protection is not selective for a particular species, organ system or toxic chemical. A 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS (100mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4, CHCl3, acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal (and presumably cardiotoxic) effect of adriamycin administration. Maximal CS-mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult. These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death. The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity). However, based on the data presented, we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation. Our findings do suggest that CS-mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule (non-hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as CS), whose mechanism has yet to be defined.
In an attempt to determine whether penile pain associated with intracorporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication, we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence of penile pain following intracorporeal injections with or without the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the intracorporeal medications. A total of 38 consecutive patients who presented to our clinic with impotence received 0.2 ml. of a combination of 3 drugs: 6 mg. papaverine, 100 micrograms. phentolamine and 10 micrograms. prostaglandin E1 with (pH 7.05) or without (pH 4.17) the addition of sodium bicarbonate (0.03 mEq.). Of the 19 patients without sodium bicarbonate added to the medication 11 (58%) complained of penile pain due to the medication, while only 1 of the 19 men (5%) who received sodium bicarbonate complained of penile pain. From these data we conclude that the penile pain following intracorporeal injections is most likely due to the acidity of the medication, which can be overcome by elevating the pH to a neutral level.
In an attempt to identify novel chemokine receptor genes, cDNA expressed sequence tags (EST) were analyzed for a significant homology with mammalian chemokine receptors. The sequence from one of the selected EST clones was used to generate a full-length cDNA encoding a putative seven transmembrane receptor, CCRL1-CC chemokine receptor like 1. The full-length receptor encodes a polypeptide of 350 amino acids and has about 35% homology to the chemokine receptors CCR6 and CCR7. Northern blot analysis indicates predominant expression of about 5.0, 2.0 and 1.3kb mRNA forms in human heart tissue, while low-level expression of the 2.0 and 1.3kb forms was observed in lung, pancreas and spleen and in fetal tissues. In-situ hybridization confirmed the presence of CCRL1 mRNA in cardiac muscle cells. Similar to the chemokine receptor CCR6, CCRL1 maps to chromosome 6 and has one intron in the 5' untranslated region. Coupled transcription-translation of CCRL1 cDNA yielded a glycosylated polypeptide of about 45kDa.
In an effort to identify novel therapeutic targets for autoimmunity and transplant rejection, we developed and performed a large-scale retroviral-based functional screen to select for proteins that inhibit antigen receptor-mediated activation of lymphocytes. In addition to known regulators of antigen receptor signaling, we identified a novel adaptor protein, SLAP-2 which shares 36% sequence similarity with the known Src-like adaptor protein, SLAP. Similar to SLAP, SLAP-2 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells. Overexpression of SLAP-2 in B and T cell lines specifically impaired antigen receptor-mediated signaling events, including CD69 surface marker upregulation, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) promoter activation and calcium influx. Signaling induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin was not significantly reduced, suggesting SLAP-2 functions proximally in the antigen receptor signaling cascade. The SLAP-2 protein contains an NH2-terminal myristoylation consensus sequence and SH3 and SH2 Src homology domains, but lacks a tyrosine kinase domain. In antigen receptor-stimulated cells, SLAP-2 associated with several tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, including the ubiquitin ligase Cbl. Deletion of the COOH terminus of SLAP-2 blocked function and abrogated its association with Cbl. Mutation of the putative myristoylation site of SLAP-2 compromised its inhibitory activity and impaired its localization to the membrane compartment. Our identification of the negative regulator SLAP-2 demonstrates that a retroviral-based screening strategy may be an efficient way to identify and characterize the function of key components of many signal transduction systems.
In ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients, mutations in a single gene, ATM, result in an autosomal recessive syndrome that embraces a variety of clinical features and manifests extreme radiosensitivity and a strong pre-disposition to malignancy. Heterozygotes for the ATM gene have no clinical expression of A-T but may be cancer prone with a moderate increase in in vitro radiosensitivity. We performed a blind chromosomal analysis on G2-phase lymphocytes from 7 unrelated A-T patients, 13 obligate A-T heterozygotes (parents of the patients), and 14 normal controls following X-irradiation with 1 Gy in order to evaluate this cytogenetic method as a tool for detection of ATM carriers. Both A-T homozygotes and heterozygotes showed significantly increased levels of radiation-induced chromatid damage relative to that of normal controls. These results show that the G2-phase chromosomal radiosensitivity assay can be used for the detection of A-T heterozygotes. In combination with molecular genetic analyses, this test may be of value in studies of familial and sporadic cancers aimed at determination of the potential involvement of ATM mutations in tumor risk or development..
In cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in the rat, detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered. Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated. Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide-pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists. Generally, atropine reduced contractions, but in contrast to controls, it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity (1-5 Hz) in inflamed preparations. In both types, purinoceptor desensitization with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) caused further reductions at low frequencies (<10 Hz). The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('M(2)-selective') and pirenzepine ('M(1)-selective') antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component. 4-DAMP inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine. In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4-DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls. In contrast to controls, methoctramine increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies. While contractions to carbachol and ATP were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference potassium response, isoprenaline-induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips. Thus, in cystitis substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur. While postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations are reduced, effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased.
In experimental nephrotic syndrome, urinary sodium excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease. The molecular mechanism(s) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated. The rate-limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrotic syndrome. The time courses of urinary sodium excretion, plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either PAN or vehicle. The relative amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real-time quantitative TaqMan PCR, and the amounts of proteins by Western blot. The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously. Sodium retention occurred on days 2, 3 and 6 after PAN injection. A significant up-regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3. Conversely, down-regulation of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations, and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control values. The amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during PAN-induced sodium retention. In conclusion, ENaC mRNA expression, especially alphaENaC, is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of PAN-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats, but appears to escape from the regulation by aldosterone after day 3.
In hereditary retinoblastoma, different epidemiological studies have indicated a preferential paternal transmission of mutant retinoblastoma alleles to offspring, suggesting the occurrence of a meiotic drive. To investigate this mechanism, we analyzed sperm samples from six individuals from five unrelated families affected with hereditary retinoblastoma. Single-sperm typing techniques were performed for each sample by study of two informative short tandem repeats located either in or close to the retinoblastoma gene (RB1). The segregation probability of mutant RB1 alleles in sperm samples was assessed by use of the SPERMSEG program, which includes experimental parameters, recombination fractions between the markers, and segregation parameters. A total of 2, 952 single sperm from the six donors were analyzed. We detected a significant segregation distortion in the data as a whole (P =. 0099) and a significant heterogeneity in the segregation rate across donors (. 0092). Further analysis shows that this result can be explained by segregation distortion in favor of the normal allele in one donor only and that it does not provide evidence of a significant segregation distortion in the other donors. The segregation distortion favoring the mutant RB1 allele does not seem to occur during spermatogenesis, and, thus, meiotic drive may result either from various mechanisms, including a fertilization advantage or a better mobility in sperm bearing a mutant RB1 gene, or from the existence of a defectively imprinted gene located on the human X chromosome.
In humans, alteration of the tumor suppressor gene, APC, causes adenomatous polyposis coli, a condition causing predisposition to colorectal cancer. The syndrome inconsistently associates characteristic patches of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). Ocular examination revealed that patients expressing CHRPE tend to cluster within specific families. The exact APC mutation was identified in 42 unrelated patients. In all cases these mutations were predicted to lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein. The extent of CHRPE was found to be dependent on the position of the mutation along the coding sequence. CHRPE lesions are almost always absent if the mutation occurs before exon 9, but are systematically present if it occurs after this exon. Thus, the range of phenotypic expression observed among affected patients may result in part from different allelic manifestations of APC mutations..
In its active form, the GTP-binding protein rab8 interacts with a stress-activated protein kinase.
In laboratory animals, histology is most commonly used to study doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. However, for monitoring during treatment, large numbers of animals are needed. Recently we developed a new method to measure ECG values in freely moving mice by telemetry. With this model we investigated the effect of chronic doxorubicin administration on the ECG of freely moving BALB/c mice and the efficacy of ICRF-187 as a protective agent. The ST interval significantly widened from 15.0 +/- 1.5 to 56.8 +/- 11.8 ms in week 10 (7 weekly doses of 4 mg/kg doxorubicin given i.v. plus 3 weeks of observation). The ECG of the control animals did not change during the entire study. After sacrifice the hearts of doxorubicin-treated animals were enlarged and the atria were hypertrophic. As this schedule exerted more toxicity than needed to investigate protective agents, the protection of ICRF-187 was determined using a dose schedule with lower general toxicity (6 weekly doses of 4 mg/kg doxorubicin given i.v. plus 2 weeks of observation). On this schedule, the animals' hearts appeared normal after sacrifice and ICRF-187 (50 mg/kg given i.p. 1 h before doxorubicin) provided almost full protection. These data were confirmed by histology. The results indicate that this new model is very sensitive and enables monitoring of the development of cardiotoxicity with time. These findings result in a model that allows the testing of protectors against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity as demonstrated by the protection provided by ICRF-187.
In male Swiss mice, muscimol produced myoclonic jerks. A 3 mg/kg (i.p.) dose induced this response in all of the mice tested and the peak response of 73 jerks per min was observed between 27 and 45 min. Increasing the brain serotonin levels by the administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan (80-160 mg/kg) in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor resulted in an inhibition of the muscimol effect. However, in a similar experiment l-dopa (80-160 mg/kg) was without effect. In doses of 3-10 mg/kg, the serotonin receptor agonist MK-212 caused a dose-dependent blockade of the response of muscimol. Of the benzodiazepines, clonazepam (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) was found to be several fold more potent than diazepam (0.3-3 mg/kg) in blocking the myoclonic jerks. While (-)-baclofen (1-3 mg/kg) proved to be an effective antagonist of muscimol, its (+)-isomer (5-20 mg/kg) lacked this property. Considering the fact that 5-HTP and the benzodiazepines have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical myoclonus, the muscimol-induced myoclonus seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition. Our present study indicated the possible value of MK-212 and (-)-baclofen in the management of clinical myoclonus.
In most patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma, tumor development is initiated by somatic inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 gene. However, some of these patients can transmit retinoblastoma predisposition to their offspring. To determine the frequency and nature of constitutional RB1-gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma, we analyzed DNA from peripheral blood and from tumor tissue. The analysis of tumors from 54 (71%) of 76 informative patients showed loss of constitutional heterozygosity (LOH) at intragenic loci. Three of 13 uninformative patients had constitutional deletions. For 39 randomly selected tumors, SSCP, hetero-duplex analysis, sequencing, and Southern blot analysis were used to identify mutations. Mutations were detected in 21 (91%) of 23 tumors with LOH. In 6 (38%) of 16 tumors without LOH, one mutation was detected, and in 9 (56%) of the tumors without LOH, both mutations were found. Thus, a total of 45 mutations were identified in tumors of 36 patients. Thirty-nine of the mutations-including 34 small mutations, 2 large structural alterations, and hypermethylation in 3 tumors-were not detected in the corresponding peripheral blood DNA. In 6 (17%) of the 36 patients, a mutation was detected in constitutional DNA, and 1 of these mutations is known to be associated with reduced expressivity. The presence of a constitutional mutation was not associated with an early age at treatment. In 1 patient, somatic mosaicism was demonstrated by molecular analysis of DNA and RNA from peripheral blood. In 2 patients without a detectable mutation in peripheral blood, mosaicism was suggested because 1 of the patients showed multifocal tumors and the other later developed bilateral retinoblastoma. In conclusion, our results emphasize that the manifestation and transmissibility of retinoblastoma depend on the nature of the first mutation, its time in development, and the number and types of cells that are affected..
In myotonic dystrophy (DM), the size of a CTG repeat in the DM kinase gene generally increases in successive generations with clinical evidence of anticipation. However, there have also been cases with an intergenerational contraction of the repeat. We examined 1, 489 DM parent-offspring pairs, of which 95 (6. 4%) showed such contractions in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). In 56 of the 95 pairs, clinical data allowed an analysis of their anticipation status. It is surprising that anticipation occurred in 27 (48%) of these 56 pairs, while none clearly showed a later onset of DM in the symptomatic offspring. The contraction occurred in 76 (10%) of 753 paternal transmissions and in 19 (3%) of 736 maternal transmissions. Anticipation was observed more frequently in maternal (85%) than in paternal (37%) transmissions (P <. 001). The parental repeat size correlated with the size of intergenerational contraction (r2 =. 50, P < <. 001), and the slope of linear regression was steeper in paternal (-. 62) than in maternal (-. 30) transmissions (P < <. 001). Sixteen DM parents had multiple DM offspring with the CTG repeat contractions. This frequency was higher than the frequency expected from the probability of the repeat contractions (6. 4%) and the size of DM sib population (1. 54 DM offspring per DM parent, in 968 DM parents). We conclude that (1) intergenerational contractions of the CTG repeat in leukocyte DNA frequently accompanies apparent anticipation, especially when DM is maternally transmitted, and (2) the paternal origin of the repeat and the presence of the repeat contraction in a sibling increase the probability of the CTG repeat contraction
In normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cystometry, intravesically instilled prostaglandin (PG) E2 facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure. The effect was attenuated by both the NK1 receptor selective antagonist RP 67,580 and the NK2 receptor selective antagonist SR 48,968, given intra-arterially, suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK1 and NK2 receptors. Intra-arterially given PGE2 produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex, indicating that the PG had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle. The effect of intra-arterial PGE2 could not be blocked by intra-arterial RP 67,580 or SR 48,968, which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra-arterial PGE2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically. The present results thus suggest that intra-arterial PGE2, given near the bladder, may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor. However, when given intravesically, PGE2 may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and/or immediately below the urothelium. These tachykinins, in turn, initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating NK1 and NK2 receptors. Prostanoids may, via release of tachykinins, contribute to both urge and bladder hyperactivity seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract.
In normal rats, the media of small arteries (0.4--0.2 mm in diameter) previously was shown to contain intracellular vacuoles, identified ultrastructurally as herniations of one smooth muscle cell into another. The hypothesis that intense vasoconstriction would increase the number of such vacuoles has been tested. In the media of the saphenous artery and its distal branch, vasoconstriction induced by L-norepinephrine produced many cell-to-cell hernias within 15 minutes. At 1 day their number was reduced to about 1/10 of the original number. By 7 days the vessel was almost restored to normal. Triple stimulation over 1 day induced more severe changes in the media. These findings suggest that smooth muscle cells are susceptible to damage in the course of their specific function. The experimental data are discussed in relation to medial changes observed in other instances of arterial spasm. Endothelial changes that developed in the same experimental model were described in a previous paper.
In order to demonstrate the effect of prophylactic colchicine treatment on the natural history of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a family is presented with 6 out of 9 siblings affected by FMF. Each patient represents a different stage of the amyloidotic kidney disease of FMF and the effect of continuous colchicine treatment on its course. Considered together, the members of this family present an almost complete clinical, genetic, and behavioral picture of the disease..
In order to elucidate the cellular and molecular processes which are involved in Norrie disease (ND), we have used gene targeting technology to generate ND mutant mice. The murine homologue of the ND gene was cloned and shown to encode a polypeptide that shares 94% of the amino acid sequence with its human counterpart. RNA in situ hybridization revealed expression in retina, brain and the olfactory bulb and epithelium of 2 week old mice. Hemizygous mice carrying a replacement mutation in exon 2 of the ND gene developed retrolental structures in the vitreous body and showed an overall disorganization of the retinal ganglion cell layer. The outer plexiform layer disappears occasionally, resulting in a juxtaposed inner and outer nuclear layer. At the same regions, the outer segments of the photoreceptor cell layer are no longer present. These ocular findings are consistent with observations in ND patients and the generated mouse line provides a faithful model for study of early pathogenic events in this severe X-linked recessive neurological disorder..
In order to elucidate the role of the catecholaminergic system in the cataleptogenic effect of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the effect of pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or with desipramine and 6-OHDA and lesions of the locus coeruleus were investigated in rats. The cataleptogenic effect of THC was significantly reduced in rats treated with 6-OHDA and in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus but not in rats treated with desipramine and 6-OHDA, as compared with control rats. On the contrary, the cataleptogenic effect of haloperidol was significantly reduced in rats treated with desipramine and 6-OHDA but not in rats treated with 6-OHDA or in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus. These results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of catalepsy induced by THC, whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in catalepsy induced by haloperidol.
In order to evaluate the efficacy, time-course of action and predictors of response to topical capsaicin, 39 patients with chronic post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), median duration 24 months, were treated with 0.025% capsaicin cream for 8 weeks. During therapy the patients rated their pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a verbal outcome scale. A follow-up investigation was performed 10-12 months after study onset on the patients who had improved. Nineteen patients (48.7%) substantially improved after the 8-week trial; 5 (12.8%) discontinued therapy due to side-effects such as intolerable capsaicin-induced burning sensations (4) or mastitis (1); 15 (38.5%) reported no benefit. The decrease in VAS ratings was significant after 2 weeks of continuous application. Of the responders 72.2% were still improved at the follow-up; only one-third of them had continued application irregularly. Treatment effect was not dependent on patient's age, duration or localization of PHN (trigeminal involvement was excluded), sensory disturbance or pain character. Treatment response was not correlated with the incidence, time-course or severity of capsaicin-induced burning. If confirmed in controlled trials, the long-term results of this open, non-randomized study might indicate that the analgesic effect of capsaicin in PHN is mediated by both interference with neuropeptide metabolism and morphological changes (perhaps degeneration) of nociceptive afferents.
In patients premedicated with scopolamine + morphine (+5 mg nitrazepam the evening before surgery), the sleep-inducing effect of midazolam 0.15 mg/kg i.v. was clearly slower in onset than that of thiopentone 4.67 mg/kg i.v. Somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the midazolam group, but, although apnoea occurred less often in the midazolam group it lasted longer. On the whole, the differences between midazolam and thiopentone had no apparent clinical consequences. Midazolam is a new alternative agent for induction in combination anaesthesia.
In platelets and other secretory cells, protein kinase C (PKC) plays a role in exocytosis stimulated by physiological extracellular signals, although its linkage to the secretory machinery is poorly understood. We investigated whether Rab6, a GTP-binding protein that fractionates with platelet alpha-granules, may be involved in linking these processes. We found that Rab6 contains two PKC consensus phosphorylation sites that are evolutionarily conserved. In platelets metabolically labelled with P(i), Rab6 phosphorylation was induced by phorbol esters or by thrombin. This phosphorylation was blocked by a specific PKC inhibitor (Ro-31-8220), but not by a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor (PD-169316). Physiological stimulation of platelets caused a PKC-dependent translocation of Rab6 from platelet particulate fractions, nearly doubling the fraction of Rab6 in the cytosol. A human Rab6 isoform (Rab6C) that is preferentially expressed in human platelet RNA was cloned and its phosphorylation by PKC was characterized. Rab6C incorporated up to 2 mol of P(i) per mol of active protein. Rab6C bound GDP and GTP with K(d) values of 113+/-12 and 119+/-27 nM respectively, and hydrolysed GTP at a rate of 100+/-15 micromol of GTP/mol of Rab6C per min. PKC phosphorylation of Rab6C increased the affinity for GTP by 3-fold, although it had lesser effects on GDP (1.6-fold). Phosphorylation did not alter the GTPase activity. In summary, thrombin activation of platelets leads to PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Rab6 and a translocation of Rab6 to the cytosol. We suggest that PKC phosphorylation may be an important mechanism through which Rab functional interactions in vesicle trafficking and secretion can be altered in response to an external stimulus.
In recent years working memory deficits have been reported in users of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy). The current study aimed to assess the impact of MDMA use on three separate central executive processes (set shifting, inhibition and memory updating) and also on "prefrontal" mediated social and emotional judgement processes. Fifteen polydrug ecstasy users and 15 polydrug non-ecstasy user controls completed a general drug use questionnaire, the Brixton Spatial Anticipation task (set shifting), Backward Digit Span procedure (memory updating), Inhibition of Return (inhibition), an emotional intelligence scale, the Tromso Social Intelligence Scale and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX). Compared with MDMA-free polydrug controls, MDMA polydrug users showed impairments in set shifting and memory updating, and also in social and emotional judgement processes. The latter two deficits remained significant after controlling for other drug use. These data lend further support to the proposal that cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex may be impaired by recreational ecstasy use.
In research towards the development of new atypical antipsychotic agents, one strategy is that the dopaminergic system can be modulated through manipulation of the serotonergic system. The synthesis and preliminary pharmacological evaluation of a series of potential atypical antipsychotic agents based on the structure of 1-(1,2-dihydro-2-acenaphthylenyl)piperazine (7) is described. Compound 7e, 5-{2-[4-(1,2-dihydro-2-acenaphthylenyl)piperazinyl]ethyl}-2,3-dihy dro-1H- indol-2-one, from this series showed significant affinities at the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity at the D2 receptor. 7e exhibits a high reversal of catalepsy induced by haloperidol indicating its atypical antipsychotic nature.
In rhesus monkeys, intravenous challenge with 0.6 x 10(10) to 2.2 x 10(10)Pseudomonas aeruginosa organisms caused acute illness of 4 to 5 days' duration with spontaneous recovery in 13 of 15 monkeys; blood cultures became negative 3 to 17 days after challenge. Leukocytosis was observed in all monkeys. Intravenous or intratracheal inoculation of 2.0 to 2.5 mg of vincristine sulfate was followed by leukopenia in 4 to 5 days. Intravenous inoculation of 4.2 x 10(10) to 7.8 x 10(10) pyocin type 6 Pseudomonas organisms in monkeys given vincristine sulfate 4 days previously resulted in fatal infection in 11 of 14 monkeys, whereas none of four receiving Pseudomonas alone died. These studies suggest that an antimetabolite-induced leukopenia predisposes to severe Pseudomonas sepsis and that such monkeys may serve as a biological model for study of comparative efficacy of antimicrobial agents.
In rodents, the effect of the beta-carboline derivative isopropyl-6- benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (abecarrnil), a new ligand for benzodiazepine receptors possessing anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties, was evaluated on the function of central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor complex, both in vitro and in vivo. Added in vitro to rat cortical membrane preparation, abecarnil increased [3H]GABA binding, enhanced muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and reduced the binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS). These effects were similar to those induced by diazepam, whereas the partial agonist Ro 16-6028 (tert-butyl-(S)-8-bromo-11,12,13,13a-tetrahydro-9-oxo-9H- imidazo[1,5-a]-pyrrolo-[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-1-carboxylate) showed very weak efficacy in these biochemical tests. After i.p. injection to rats, abecarnil and diazepam decreased in a time-dependent and dose-related (0.25-20 mg/kg i.p.) manner [35S]TBPS binding measured ex vivo in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, both drugs at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg antagonized completely the convulsant activity and the increase of [35S]TBPS binding induced by isoniazide (350 mg/kg s.c.) as well as the increase of [35S]TBPS binding induced by foot-shock stress. To better correlate the biochemical and the pharmacological effects, we studied the action of abecarnil on [35S]TBPS binding, exploratory motility and on isoniazid-induced biochemical and pharmacological effects in mice. In these animals, abecarnil produced a paralleled dose-dependent (0.05-1 mg/kg i.p.) reduction of both motor behavior and cortical [35S]TBPS binding. Moreover, 0.05 mg/kg of this beta-carboline reduced markedly the increase of [35S]TBPS binding and the convulsions induced by isoniazid (200 mg/kg s.c.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
In situ hybridization methods were used to determine if glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA-containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to seizure-induced damage in a model of chronic seizures. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with pilocarpine, and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1, 2, 4, and 8 week intervals after pilocarpine-induced seizures. In situ hybridization histochemistry, using a digoxigenin-labeled GAD cRNA probe, demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in the pilocarpine-treated rats as compared to controls at all time intervals. Additional neuronanatomical studies, including cresyl violet staining, neuronal degeneration methods, and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons was related to neuronal loss rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels. The loss of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer. Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals. No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer, which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer. The results indicate that, in this model, a subpopulation of GAD mRNA-containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to seizure-induced damage. Such differential vulnerability appears to be another indication of the heterogeneity of GABA neurons.
In situ hybridization of a cDNA probe for the esterase D gene (ESD) was carried out on human chromosomes. The probe hybridized most strongly to 13q14. 2 and 13q14. 3. This observation raises doubts concerning the most recently published assignment of ESD to 13q14. 1. A deletion in an individual with retinoblastoma was reported to separate the closely linked ESD and retinoblastoma (RB1) loci, placing ESD proximal to RB1. Quantitative in situ hybridization studies of this deletion do not confirm this interpretation. Rather, they suggest that ESD is missing from the deleted chromosome 13 and duplicated on the normal homolog. From these findings, we conclude that the deletion in this individual cannot be used to determine the orientation nor the sublocalization of ESD and RB1 within the 13q14 region.
In six conscious, trained dogs, maintained on a normal sodium intake of 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day, sympathetic activity was assessed as the release rate of norepinephrine and epinephrine during 15-minute i.v. infusions of human alpha-atrial natriuretic factor. Mean arterial pressure (as a percentage of control +/- SEM) during randomized infusions of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 microgram/kg/min was 99 +/- 1, 95 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05), 93 +/- 1 (p less than 0.01), or 79 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001), respectively, but no tachycardia and no augmentation of the norepinephrine release rate (up to 0.3 microgram/kg/min) were observed, which is in contrast to comparable hypotension induced by hydralazine or nitroglycerin. The release rate of epinephrine (control, 6.7 +/- 0.6 ng/kg/min) declined immediately during infusions of atrial natriuretic factor to a minimum of 49 +/- 5% of control (p less than 0.001) during 0.1 microgram/kg/min and to 63 +/- 5% (0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05) or 95 +/- 13% (not significant) during 0.3 or 1.0 microgram/kg/min. Steady state arterial plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were 39 +/- 10 pg/ml (n = 6) during infusions of saline and 284 +/- 24 pg/ml (n = 6) and 1520 +/- 300 pg/ml (n = 9) during 0.03 and 0.1 microgram/kg/min infusions of the factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
In the Caucasian population, it has been demonstrated that the insulin gene (INS) region contains the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus locus (IDDM2). In the Japanese population, however, there has been no report demonstrating the contribution of IDDM2 to the pathogenesis of IDDM. We conducted an association study of IDDM in a large number of Japanese subjects with multiple polymorphisms in INS region. We found a significant association of the INS region with IDDM. Alleles positively associated with IDDM in INS region were the same as those positively-associated with IDDM in Caucasian population, although positively-associated alleles are very common (allele frequencies > 0. 9) in the Japanese general population. These data suggest that IDDM2 is involved in the genetic susceptibility to IDDM in Japanese. The high frequencies of disease-associated alleles in the general population suggest that IDDM2 locus is not responsible for the low incidence of IDDM in Japanese.
In the cardiovascular system, NO is involved in the regulation of a variety of functions. Inhibition of NO synthesis induces sustained hypertension. In several models of hypertension, elevation of intracellular sodium level was documented in cardiac tissue. To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of Na+, we studied the response of cardiac (Na,K)-ATPase to NO-deficient hypertension induced in rats by NO-synthase inhibition with 40 mg/kg/day N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) for 4 four weeks. After 4-week administration of L-NAME, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased by 36%. Two weeks after terminating the treatment, the SBP recovered to control value. When activating the (Na,K)-ATPase with its substrate ATP, no changes in Km and Vmax values were observed in NO-deficient rats. During activation with Na+, the Vmax remained unchanged, however the K(Na) increased by 50%, indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of the Na+-binding site in NO-deficient rats. After recovery from hypertension, the activity of (Na,K)-ATPase increased, due to higher affinity of the ATP-binding site, as revealed from the lowered Km value for ATP. The K(Na) value for Na+ returned to control value. Inhibition of NO-synthase induced a reversible hypertension accompanied by depressed Na+-extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated Na+-binding properties of the (Na,K)-ATPase. After recovery of blood pressure to control values, the extrusion of Na+ from cardiac cells was normalized, as revealed by restoration of the (Na,K)-ATPase activity.
In the congenital long-QT syndrome, prolongation of the cardiac action potential occurs by an unknown mechanism and predisposes individuals to syncope and sudden death as a result of ventricular arrhythmias. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for autosomal dominant long-QT syndrome by the identification of multiple distinct loci, and associated mutations in two candidate genes have recently been reported. One form of hereditary long QT (LQT3) has been linked to a mutation in the gene encoding the human heart voltage-gated sodium-channel alpha-subunit (SCN5A on chromosome 3p21). Here we characterize this mutation using heterologous expression of recombinant human heart sodium channels. Mutant channels show a sustained inward current during membrane depolarization. Single-channel recordings indicate that mutant channels fluctuate between normal and non-inactivating gating modes. Persistent inward sodium current explains prolongation of cardiac action potentials, and provides a molecular mechanism for this form of congenital long-QT syndrome.
In the initiation of translation in eukaryotes, binding of the small ribosomal subunit to the messenger RNA results from recognition of the 5' cap structure (m7GpppX) of the mRNA by the cap-binding complex eIF4F. eIF4F is itself a three-subunit complex comprising the cap-binding protein eIF4E, eIF4A, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, and eIF4G, which interacts with both eIF4A and eIF4E and enhances cap binding by eIF4E. The mRNA 3' polyadenylate tail and the associated poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) also regulate translational initiation, probably by interacting with the 5' end of the mRNA. In yeast and plants, PABP interacts with eIF4G but no such interaction has been reported in mammalian cells. Here, we describe a new human PABP-interacting protein, PAIP-I, whose sequence is similar to the central portion of eIF4G and which interacts with eIF4A. Overexpression of PAIP-1 in COS-7 cells stimulates translation, perhaps by providing a physical link between the mRNA termini.
In the last few years delayed reactions several hours after the injection of radiographic and contrast materials (PRC) have been described with increasing frequency. The authors report two observations on patients with delayed reactions in whom intradermoreactions (IDR) and patch tests to a series of ionic and non ionic PRC were studied. After angiography by the venous route in patient n degree 1 a biphasic reaction with an immediate reaction (dyspnea, loss of consciousness) and delayed macro-papular rash appeared, whilst patient n degree 2 developed a generalised sensation of heat, persistent pain at the site of injection immediately and a generalised macro-papular reaction after 24 hours. The skin tests revealed positive delayed reactions of 24 hours and 48 hours by IDR and patch tests to only some PRC with common chains in their structures. The positive skin tests are in favour of immunological reactions and may help in diagnosis of allergy in the patients.
In the present study the role of glial activation and post synaptic toxicity in ICV Streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory impaired rats was explored. In experiment set up 1: Memory deficit was found in Morris water maze test on 14-16 days after STZ (ICV; 3mg/Kg) administration. STZ causes increased expression of GFAP, CD11b and TNF-a indicating glial activation and neuroinflammation. STZ also significantly increased the level of ROS, nitrite, Ca(2+) and reduced the mitochondrial activity in synaptosomal preparation illustrating free radical generation and excitotoxicity. Increased expression and activity of Caspase-3 was also observed in STZ treated rat which specify apoptotic cell death in hippocampus and cortex. STZ treatment showed decrease expression of post synaptic markers CaMKIIa and PSD-95, while, expression of pre synaptic markers (synaptophysin and SNAP-25) remains unaltered indicating selective post synaptic neurotoxicity. Oral treatment with Memantine (10mg/kg) and Ibuprofen (50 mg/kg) daily for 13 days attenuated STZ induced glial activation, apoptotic cell death and post synaptic neurotoxicity in rat brain. Further, in experiment set up 2: where memory function was not affected i.e. 7-9 days after STZ treatment. The level of GFAP, CD11b, TNF-a, ROS and nitrite levels were increased. On the other hand, apoptotic marker, synaptic markers, mitochondrial activity and Ca(2+) levels remained unaffected. Collective data indicates that neuroinflammatory process and oxidative stress occurs earlier to apoptosis and does not affect memory function. Present study clearly suggests that glial activation and post synaptic neurotoxicity are the key factors in STZ induced memory impairment and neuronal cell death.
In the present study we show that following transfection in 3T3 cells, human Robo1 and Robo2 stimulate neurite outgrowth from Robo-positive neurons (retinal neurons and olfactory neurons), but have no effect on Robo-negative neurons (cerebellar granule cells). The neurite outgrowth response was inhibited by an antibody raised against the first Ig domain of Robo1/2 or by soluble Robo-Fc chimera. Furthermore, we show that the extracellular domains of Robo1 and Robo2 are homophilic adhesion molecules that can also interact with each other. These data suggest a wider range of functions for the Robo family in the development of the nervous system and provide novel insights into the molecular basis for the phenotypes observed in Robo mutants in Drosophila, C. elegans, and zebrafish.
In the present study, effects of nicotine on catalepsy induced by morphine in mice have been investigated. Morphine but not nicotine induced a dose-dependent catalepsy. The response of morphine was potentiated by nicotine. Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, naloxone, mecamylamine, and hexamethonium to mice reduced catalepsy induced by a combination of morphine with nicotine. Intracerebroventricular injection of atropine, hexamethonium, and naloxone also decreased catalepsy induced by morphine plus nicotine. Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of hexamethonium, decreased the effect of a single dose of morphine. It was concluded that morphine catalepsy can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors, and the potentiation of morphine induced by nicotine may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms.
In the present study, leukocyte DNA from 143 patients with familial clustering of breast and/or ovarian cancer and tumour DNA from 96 breast carcinomas were screened for base mutations in the estrogen receptor gene (ESR). Three patients with a family history of cancer were carrying a Gly160Cys germline substitution. This alteration was also detected in eight (four females and four males) of 729 controls (366 female, 363 males), indicating that the substitution probably represents a polymorphism. However, in the 229 female controls in whom family history of cancer was known, one of two who had a sister with breast cancer was carrying the variant allele. Hence, a possible clinical significance of the glycine into cysteine cannot be completely ruled out and should be further investigated. Somatic mutations were not detected in any of the tumours studied, and the present data do not provide support for somatic ESR base mutations as an important mechanism for hormonal therapy resistance in estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinomas..
In the present study, we have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel member of the family of zinc metallopeptidases that includes neutral endopeptidase and endothelin-converting enzyme. The predicted amino-acid sequence of this enzyme, termed XCE, consists of 775 amino-acids with a single putative membrane-spanning region, an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 59 residues, and a large luminal domain that contains a characteristic zinc-binding motif. Western blot analysis of cells stably expressing this new metallopeptidase revealed a glycosylated protein of approximately 95 kDa. XCE mRNA was found to be predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, sympathetic ganglia and in uterine subepithelial cells. In the rat and human CNS, a very specific pattern of neuronal labelling (in presumptive cholinergic interneurons of basal ganglia, basal forebrain neurons, as well as brainstem and spinal cord motoneurons) was detected by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The enzyme substrate, as yet unidentified, might be found among the numerous neuropeptide transmitters which are colocalized with acetylcholine in these neurons.
In the present work we assessed the effect of treatment of rats with gum Arabic on acute renal failure induced by gentamicin (GM) nephrotoxicity. Rats were treated with the vehicle (2 mL/kg of distilled water and 5% w/v cellulose, 10 days), gum Arabic (2 mL/kg of a 10% w/v aqueous suspension of gum Arabic powder, orally for 10 days), or gum Arabic concomitantly with GM (80mg/kg/day intramuscularly, during the last six days of the treatment period). Nephrotoxicity was assessed by measuring the concentrations of creatinine and urea in the plasma and reduced glutathione (GSH) in the kidney cortex, and by light microscopic examination of kidney sections. The results indicated that concomitant treatment with gum Arabic and GM significantly increased creatinine and urea by about 183 and 239%, respectively (compared to 432 and 346%, respectively, in rats treated with cellulose and GM), and decreased that of cortical GSH by 21% (compared to 27% in the cellulose plus GM group) The GM-induced proximal tubular necrosis appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given GM together with gum Arabic than in those given GM and cellulose. It could be inferred that gum Arabic treatment has induced a modest amelioration of some of the histological and biochemical indices of GM nephrotoxicity. Further work is warranted on the effect of the treatments on renal functional aspects in models of chronic renal failure, and on the mechanism(s) involved.
In the process of positionally cloning a candidate gene responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), we constructed a 1.1-Mb transcript map of the region of human chromosome 6p that lies 4.5 Mb telomeric to HLA-A. A combination of three gene-finding techniques, direct cDNA selection, exon trapping, and sample sequencing, were used initially for a saturation screening of the 1.1-Mb region for expressed sequence fragments. As genetic analysis further narrowed the HH candidate locus, we sequenced completely 0.25 Mb of genomic DNA as a final measure to identify all genes. Besides the novel MHC class 1-like HH candidate gene HLA-H, we identified a family of five butyrophilin-related sequences, two genes with structural similarity to a type 1 sodium phosphate transporter, 12 novel histone genes, and a gene we named RoRet based on its strong similarity to the 52-kD Ro/SSA lupus and Sjogren's syndrome auto-antigen and the RET finger protein. Several members of the butyrophilin family and the RoRet gene share an exon of common evolutionary origin called B30-2. The B30-2 exon was originally isolated from the HLA class 1 region, yet has apparently "shuffled" into several genes along the chromosome telomeric to the MHC. The conservation of the B30-2 exon in several novel genes and the previously described amino acid homology of HLA-H to MHC class 1 molecules provide further support that this gene-rich region of 6p21.3 is related to the MHC. Finally, we performed an analysis of the four approaches for gene finding and conclude that direct selection provides the most effective probes for cDNA screening, and that as much as 30% of ESTs in this 1.1-Mb region may be derived from noncoding genomic DNA.
In this report we describe the case of a 37-year-old white woman with Ebstein's anomaly, who developed a rare syndrome called platypnea-orthodeoxia, characterized by massive right-to-left interatrial shunting with transient profound hypoxia and cyanosis. This shunt of blood via a patent foramen ovale occurred in the presence of a normal pulmonary artery pressure, and was probably precipitated by a propafenone overdose. This drug caused biventricular dysfunction, due to its negative inotropic effect, and hypotension, due to its peripheral vasodilatory effect. These effects gave rise to an increase in the right atrial pressure and a decrease in the left one with a consequent stretching of the foramen ovale and the creation of massive right-to-left shunting. In our case this interatrial shunt was very accurately detected at bubble contrast echocardiography.
In this study we describe a three-generation family in which two siblings were affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Immunohistochemical analysis of muscle dystrophin and haplotype analysis of the DMD locus revealed that the X chromosome carrying the DMD gene was transmitted from the healthy maternal grandfather to his three daughters, including the probands mother. These findings indicate that the grandfather was a germinal mosaic for the DMD gene. The definition of the carrier status in two possible carriers led us to give accurate genetic counselling and to prevent the birth of an affected boy. The results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of haplotype analysis and immunohistochemical muscle dystrophin studies to detect hidden germinal mosaicism and to improve genetic counselling..
In this study we investigated 45 German breast/ovarian cancer families for germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene. We identified four germline mutations in three breast cancer families and in one breast-ovarian cancer family. among these were one frameshift mutation, one nonsense mutation, one novel splice site mutation, and one missense mutation. The missense mutation was also found in 2. 8% of the general population, suggesting that it is not disease associated. The average age of disease onset in those families harbouring causative mutations was between 32. 3 and 37. 4 years, whereas the family harbouring the missense mutation had an average age of onset of 51. 2 years. These findings show that BRCA1 is implicated in a small fraction of breast/ovarian cancer families suggesting the involvement of another susceptibility gene (s)
In this study we postulated that during acute renal failure induced by gentamicin the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected, and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels. The new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered, but also dynamics of this response, was used in this paper. Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals. The beneficial effects of vitamin C administration to gentamicin-treated animals are also confirmed through: lower level of blood urea and creatinine and higher level of potassium. The pressure dynamic responses of isolated blood vessels show a faster pressure change in gentamicin-treated animals (8.07 +/- 1.7 s vs. 5.64 +/- 0.18 s). Vitamin C administration induced slowdown of pressure change back to the control values. The pressure dynamic properties, quantitatively defined by comparative pressure dynamic and total pressure dynamic, confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals and beneficial effects of vitamin C administration.
In this study, three Chinese patients with ticlopidine-induced aplastic anemia were reported and another 13 patients in the English literature were reviewed. We attempted to find underlying similarities, evaluate the risk factors, and identify appropriate treatment for this complication. All but one of the patients were over 60 years old, and the 6 who died were all older than 65. Therefore, old age may be a risk factor for developing this complication. Agranulocytosis occurred 3-20 weeks after initiation of ticlopidine, so frequent examination of white cell count during treatment is recommended. There seemed to be no direct correlation between the dose or duration used and the severity of bone marrow suppression. Treatment for ticlopidine-induced aplastic anemia with colony-stimulating factors seemed to have little effect. The fact that 5 of the 6 patients who received concurrent calcium channel blockers died, should alert clinicians to be more cautious when using these two drugs simultaneously.
In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMCs) in a model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine in rats. BMCs obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice or rats were transplanted intravenously after induction of status epilepticus (SE). Spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) were monitored using Racine's seizure severity scale. All of the rats in the saline-treated epileptic control group developed SRS, whereas none of the BMC-treated epileptic animals had seizures in the short term (15 days after transplantation), regardless of the BMC source. Over the long-term chronic phase (120 days after transplantation), only 25% of BMC-treated epileptic animals had seizures, but with a lower frequency and duration compared to the epileptic control group. The density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with BMCs was markedly preserved. At hippocampal Schaeffer collateral-CA1 synapses, long-term potentiation was preserved in BMC-transplanted rats compared to epileptic controls. The donor-derived GFP(+) cells were rarely found in the brains of transplanted epileptic rats. In conclusion, treatment with BMCs can prevent the development of chronic seizures, reduce neuronal loss, and influence the reorganization of the hippocampal neuronal network.
In twenty beagle dogs selective injections were made into the left coronary artery with iopentol, iohexol and metrizoate in doses of 4 ml, 8 ml and 16 ml. Thirty-six iopentol injections, 35 iohexol injections and 37 metrizoate injections were made. Frequencies of ventricular fibrillation were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) after iopentol (0%) and iohexol (3%) than after metrizoate (22%). Iopentol and iohexol also produced significantly less decrease in aortic blood pressure than metrizoate at the different doses.
In two unrelated families, males have been identified who suffer from choroideremia and at the same time have an interstitial deletion on the proximal long arm of the X chromosome. By high-resolution banding we have characterized the deletion chromosomes as del (X) (q21. 1-q21 1-q21. 33) and del (X) (q21. 2-q21 2-q21. 31) respectively. By Southern blot analysis we have mapped ten different polymorphic DNA loci relative to the position of the deletion and the choroideremia locus TCD. One probe, p31, was shown to cover one of the breakpoints of the smallest deletion. The following order of the loci was suggested by deletion mapping cen-DXS106-DXS72-TCD- (DXYS1/DXYS23/DXYS5) - DXYS2- (DXYS12/DXS3) - (DXS17/DXS101) - Xqter.
In unanesthetized, spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine, 5 to 20 micrograms/kg, was inhibited or reversed by nalozone, 0.2 to 2 mg/kg. The hypotensive effect of 100 mg/kg alpha-methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone. Naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate. In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3H]-naloxone (8 nM), and naloxone, 10(-8) to 10(-4) M, did not influence clonidine-suppressible binding of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine (1 nM). These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors. As naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site, the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha-methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone.

Inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 gene during normal retinal development initiates the formation of a retinoblastoma (RB) tumor. To identify the mutations which inactivate RB1, 21 RB tumors isolated from 19 patients were analyzed with the polymerase chain reaction or an RNase protection assay or both. Mutations were identified in 13 of 21 RB tumors; in 8 tumors, the precise errors in nucleotide sequence were characterized. Each of four germ line mutations involved a small deletion or duplication, while three somatic mutations were point mutations leading to splice alterations and loss of an exon from the mature RB1 mRNA. We were unable to detect expression of the mutant allele in lymphoblasts of three bilaterally affected patients, although the mutation was present in the genomic DNA and transcripts containing the mutations were obvious in the RB tumors in the absence of a normal RB1 allele. The variations in the level of expression of mutant transcripts suggest deregulation of RB1 transcription in the absence of a functional RB1 gene product..
Inactivation of germline mutant APC alleles by attenuated somatic mutations: a molecular genetic mechanism for attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis.
Inactivation of the Friedreich ataxia mouse gene leads to early embryonic lethality without iron accumulation.
Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product initiates colorectal tumorigenesis. Patients with familial APC (FAP) carry germ-line mutations in the APC gene and develop multiple colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas early in life. The severity of the disease correlates with the position of the inherited APC mutation (genotype-phenotype correlation). Together with the fact that both germ-line and sporadic APC mutations cluster in the central region of the APC gene, this points to a dominant negative effect of certain APC mutants. Loss of APC function was recently shown to result in enhanced beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect of APC gene products associated with severe polyposis. Wild-type APC activity in beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant APC that is truncated at codon 1309. In contrast, mutant APC gene products that are associated with attenuated polyposis (codon 386 or 1465) interfered only weakly with wild-type APC activity. These results suggest a molecular explanation for the genotype-phenotype correlation in FAP patients and support the idea that colorectal tumor growth might be, in part, driven by selection for a mutation in the mutation cluster region..

Incomplete cerebral ischemia (30 min) was induced in the rat by bilaterally clamping the common carotid arteries. Peripheral venous blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral vein four times (once every 5 min) before ischemia (0 time) and 5, 15, and 30 min after ischemia. Plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides. During ischemia, a time-dependent increase of plasma oxypurines and nucleosides was observed. Plasma malondialdehyde, which was present in minimal amount at zero time (0.058 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.015), increased after 5 min of ischemia, resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion (0.298 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.078). Increased plasma malondialdehyde was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model, one receiving 20 mg/kg b.w. of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylate intravenously immediately before ischemia, the other receiving 650 micrograms/kg b.w. of the hypotensive drug nitroprusside at a flow rate of 103 microliters/min intravenously during ischemia, although in this latter group malondialdehyde was significantly higher. The present data indicate that the determination of malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides in peripheral blood, may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during ischemic phenomena.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Increased extracellular concentrations of uridine (Urd) have been reported to reduce, in vitro, azidothymidine (AZT)-induced inhibition of human granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells without impairment of its antihuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity. Because of the clinical toxicities associated with chronic Urd administration, the ability of benzylacyclouridine (BAU) to effect, in vivo, AZT-induced anemia and leukopenia was assessed. This agent inhibits Urd catabolism and, in vivo, increases the plasma concentration of Urd in a dose-dependent manner, without Urd-related toxicity. In mice rendered anemic and leukopenic by the administration of AZT for 28 days in drinking water (1.5 mg/mL), the continued administration of AZT plus daily BAU (300 mg/kg, orally) partially reversed AZT-induced anemia and leukopenia (P less than .05), increased peripheral reticulocytes (to 4.9%, P less than .01), increased cellularity in the marrow, and improved megaloblastosis. When coadministered with AZT from the onset of drug administration, BAU reduced AZT-induced marrow toxicity. In vitro, at a concentration of 100 mumol/L, BAU possesses minimal anti-HIV activity and has no effect on the ability of AZT to reverse the HIV-induced cytopathic effect in MT4 cells. The clinical and biochemical implications of these findings are discussed.

Increasing recognition of the importance of calcium in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease has stimulated research into the use of calcium channel blocking agents for treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. The favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles of these agents make them attractive therapeutic modalities. Clinical applications of calcium channel blockers parallel their tissue selectivity. In contrast to verapamil and diltiazem, which are roughly equipotent in their actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are a group of potent peripheral vasodilator agents that exert minimal electrophysiologic effects on cardiac nodal or conduction tissue. As the first dihydropyridine available for use in the United States, nifedipine controls angina and hypertension with minimal depression of cardiac function. Additional members of this group of calcium channel blockers have been studied for a variety of indications for which they may offer advantages over current therapy. Once or twice daily dosage possible with nitrendipine and nisoldipine offers a convenient administration schedule, which encourages patient compliance in long-term therapy of hypertension. The coronary vasodilating properties of nisoldipine have led to the investigation of this agent for use in angina. Selectivity for the cerebrovascular bed makes nimodipine potentially useful in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage, migraine headache, dementia, and stroke. In general, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are usually well tolerated, with headache, facial flushing, palpitations, edema, nausea, anorexia, and dizziness being the more common adverse effects.

Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir. Many patients, however, develop negative long-term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis. We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice. Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir-treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation. In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. We have utilized the human monocyte cell line, THP-1 as a model to address this question. Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta-estradiol (E2), 100 nM progesterone or vehicle (0.01% ethanol). Cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested, and lipid or total RNA was isolated. E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment. Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, responsible for the uptake of LDL. Additionally, ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression. Treatment with E2, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level. E2 did, however, significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment.
Individuals with subtotal complement C6 deficiency possess a C6 molecule that is 14% shorter than normal C6 and present in low but detectable concentrations (1-2% of the normal mean). We now show that this dysmorphic C6 is bactericidally active and lacks an epitope that was mapped to the most carboxy-terminal part of C6 using C6 cDNA fragments expressed as fusion proteins in the pUEX expression system. We thus predicted that the abnormal C6 molecule might be carboxy-terminally truncated and sought a mutation in an area approximately 14% from the carboxy-terminal end of the coding sequence. By sequencing PCR-amplified products from this region, we found, in three individuals from two families, a mutation that might plausibly be responsible for the defect. All three have an abnormal 5 splice donor site of intron 15, which would probably prevent splicing. An in-frame stop codon is found 17 codons downstream from the intron boundary, which would lead to a truncated polypeptide 13. 5% smaller than normal C6. This result was unexpected, as earlier studies mapped the C5b binding site, or a putative enzymatic region, to this part of C6. Interestingly, all three subjects were probably heterozygous for both subtotal C6 and complete C6 deficiency.

Induction of intravascular coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and tranexamic acid (AMCA) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after trauma or sepsis in man. Injection of Captopril (1 mg/kg), an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model. The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme-blocking agent. The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed, indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein. Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril. The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and AMCA alone. It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and an increase in prostacyclin (secondary to an increase in bradykinin). Captopril may, by the same mechanism, reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin, thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli, with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced.

Infantile Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is caused by mutations in the HEXA gene that result in the complete absence of beta-hexosaminidase A activity. It is well known that an elevated frequency of TSD mutations exists among Ashkenazi Jews. More recently it has become apparent that elevated carrier frequencies for TSD also occur in several other ethnic groups, including Moroccan Jews, a subgroup of Sephardic Jews. Elsewhere we reported an in-frame deletion of one of the two adjacent phenylalanine codons at position 304 or 305 (delta F304/305) in one HEXA allele of a Moroccan Jewish TSD patient and in three obligate carriers from six unrelated Moroccan Jewish families. We have now identified two additional mutations within exon 5 of the HEXA gene that account for the remaining TSD alleles in the patient and carriers. One of the mutations is a novel C-to-G transversion, resulting in a replacement of Tyr180 by a stop codon. The other mutation is a G-to-A transition resulting in an Arg170-to-Gln substitution. This mutation is at a CpG site in a Japanese infant with Tay-Sachs disease and was described elsewhere. Analysis of nine obligate carriers from seven unrelated families showed that four harbor the delta F304/305 mutation, two the Arg170----Gln mutation, and one the Tyr180----Stop mutation. We also have developed rapid, nonradioactive assays for the detection of each mutation, which should be helpful for carrier screening..
Infarct-avid radiopharmaceuticals are necessary for rapid and timely diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The animal model used to produce infarction implies artery ligation but chemical induction can be easily obtained with isoproterenol. A new infarct-avid radiopharmaceutical based on glucaric acid was prepared in the hospital radiopharmacy of the INCMNSZ. 99mTc-glucarate was easy to prepare, stable for 96 h and was used to study its biodistribution in rats with isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial infarction. Histological studies demonstrated that the rats developed an infarct 18 h after isoproterenol administration. The rat biodistribution studies showed a rapid blood clearance via the kidneys. Thirty minutes after 99mTc-glucarate administration the standardised heart uptake value S(h)UV was 4.7 in infarcted rat heart which is six times more than in normal rats. ROIs drawn over the gamma camera images showed a ratio of 4.4. The high image quality suggests that high contrast images can be obtained in humans and the 96 h stability makes it an ideal agent to detect, in patients, early cardiac infarction.
Infection by HTLV-1 has been correlated with the appearance of various proliferative or degenerative diseases. Some of these disorders have been observed in transgenic mice expressing the Tax protein, which is known to transactivate various viral and cellular promoters through interactions with several transcription factors. In this study we show that the C-terminus of this viral oncoprotein represents a motif permitting binding of Tax to the PDZ domains of several cellular proteins. A two-hybrid screen with Tax as bait indeed yielded complementary DNAs coding for six proteins including PDZ domains. Two of them correspond to truncated forms of the PSD-95 and beta1-syntrophin proteins, another clone codes for a protein homologous to the product of the C. elegans gene lin-7. The other three clones code for new human members of the PDZ family of cellular proteins. The interaction of Tax with the products of these clones was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells, and analysis of various mutants of Tax established the importance of the C-terminal amino acids for several of these interactions. These data suggest that Tax could perturb the normal function of targeted cellular proteins by strongly interacting with their PDZ domains.
Infevers (Internet Fevers; http://fmf.igh.cnrs.fr/ISSAID/infevers), a website dedicated to mutations responsible for hereditary autoinflammatory diseases, was created in 2002 and has continued to evolve. This new version includes eight genes; six were already present: MEFV, MVK, TNFRSF1A, NLRP3, NOD2, PSTPIP1, and two are new, LPIN2 and NLRP7. Currently, Infevers contains over 540 sequence variants. Several new database functions were recently instituted. The website now accepts confidential data and complex alleles. For each gene, a newly created menu offers: 1) a tabular list of the variants that can be sorted by several parameters; 2) a gene graph providing a schematic representation of the variants along the gene; 3) statistical analysis of the data according to the phenotype, alteration type, and location of the mutation in the gene; 4) the cDNA and gDNA sequences of each gene, showing the nucleotide changes along the sequence, with a color-based code highlighting the gene domains, the first ATG, and the termination codon; and 5) a "download" menu making all tables and figures available for the users, which, except for the gene graphs, are all automatically generated and updated upon submission of the variants. Finally, the entire database was curated to comply with the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) and HGVS nomenclature guidelines, and wherever necessary, an informative note was provided. Infevers has already proven useful for the scientific community with a mean number of visits per month of 200 in 2002 and 800 in 2007, and its new design will lead to a more comprehensive comparative analysis and interpretation of auto-inflammatory sequence variants.
Inflammatory cells are postulated to mediate some of the brain damage following ischemic stroke. Intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with more inflammation than ischemic stroke. We tested the sulfated polysaccharide fucoidan, which has been reported to reduce inflammatory brain damage, in a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage induced by injection of bacterial collagenase into the caudate nucleus. Rats were treated with seven day intravenous infusion of fucoidan (30 micrograms h-1) or vehicle. The hematoma was assessed in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging. Motor behavior, passive avoidance, and skilled forelimb function were tested repeatedly for six weeks. Fucoidan-treated rats exhibited evidence of impaired blood clotting and hemodilution, had larger hematomas, and tended to have less inflammation in the vicinity of the hematoma after three days. They showed significantly more rapid improvement of motor function in the first week following hemorrhage and better memory retention in the passive avoidance test. Acute white matter edema and eventual neuronal loss in the striatum adjacent to the hematoma did not differ between the two groups. Investigation of more specific anti-inflammatory agents and hemodiluting agents are warranted in intracerebral hemorrhage.

Inherited complement deficiencies are associated with a variety of connective tissue diseases. A family with inherited deficiency of complement factor 2 (C2) is described in which two family members with homozygous C2 deficiency developed cutaneous vasculitis and sicca syndrome. The other family members had heterozygous C2 deficiency and each member had the HLA-A25, B18, DR2 (w15) haplotype. The mother had seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. Further studies showed the presence of cryoglobulins, antibodies against endothelial cells, and anticardiolipin antibodies..
Inherited defects in the peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) lead to the lethal peroxisomal disorder X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), for which no efficient treatment has been established so far. Three other peroxisomal ABC transporters currently are known adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein (ALDRP), 70 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70) and PMP70- related protein. By using transient and stable overexpression of human cDNAs encoding ALDP and its closest relative ALDRP, we could restore the impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation in fibroblasts of X-ALD patients. The pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids could also be prevented by overexpression of ALDRP in immortalized X-ALD cells. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the functional replacement of ALDP by ALDRP was not due to stabilization of the mutated ALDP itself. Moreover, we were able to restore the peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect in the liver of ALDP-deficient mice by stimulation of ALDRP and PMP70 gene expression through a dietary treatment with the peroxisome proliferator fenofibrate. These results suggest that a correction of the biochemical defect in X-ALD could be possible by drug-induced overexpression or ectopic expression of ALDRP..
Inherited mutant alleles of familial tumour suppressor genes predispose individuals to particular types of cancer. In addition to an involvement in inherited susceptibility to cancer, these tumour suppressor genes are targets for somatic mutations in sporadic cancers of the same type found in the familial forms. An exception is BRCA1, which contributes to a significant fraction of familial breast and ovarian cancer, but undergoes mutation at very low rates in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers. This finding suggests that other genes may be the principal targets for somatic mutation in breast carcinoma. A second, recently identified familial breast cancer gene, BRCA2 (refs 5-8), accounts for a proportion of breast cancer roughly equal to BRCA1. Like BRCA1, BRCA2 behaves as a dominantly inherited tumour suppressor gene. Individuals who inherit one mutant allele are at increased risk for breast cancer, and the tumours they develop lose the wild-type allele by heterozygous deletion. The BRCA2 coding sequence is huge, composed of 26 exons that span 10, 443 bp. Here we investigate the rate of BRCA2 mutation in sporadic breast cancers and in a set of cell lines that represent twelve other tumour types. Surprisingly, mutations in BRCA2 are infrequent in cancers including breast carcinoma. However, a probable germline mutation in a pancreatic tumour cell line suggests a role for BRCA2 in susceptibility to pancreatic cancer..
Inherited mutations in BRCA1 predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, but the role of BRCA1 in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer has previously been elusive. Here, we show that retroviral transfer of the wild-type BRCA1 gene inhibits growth in vitro of all breast and ovarian cancer cell lines tested, but not colon or lung cancer cells or fibroblasts. Mutant BRCA1 has no effect on growth of breast cancer cells; ovarian cancer cell growth is not affected by BRCA1 mutations in the 5 portion of the gene, but is inhibited by 3 BRCA1 mutations. Development of MCF-7 tumours in nude mice is inhibited when MCF-7 cells are transfected with wild-type, but not mutant, BRCA1. Most importantly, among mice with established MCF-7 tumours, peritoneal treatment with a retroviral vector expressing wild-type BRCA1 significantly inhibits tumour growth and increased survival..
Inherited mutations in the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) were described recently in three Maori kindreds with familial gastric cancer. Familial gastric cancer is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric cancer susceptibility in non-Maori populations is due to germline CDH1 mutations. Therefore, we screened eight familial gastric cancer kindreds of British and Irish origin for germline CDH1 mutations, by SSCP analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences. Each family contained (i) two cases of gastric cancer in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years; or (ii) three or more cases of gastric cancer. Novel germline CDH1 mutations (a nonsense and a splice site) were detected in two families (25%). Both mutations were predicted to truncate the E-cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain. In one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancer; thus, in addition to six cases of gastric cancer, a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30 years. We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric cancer in non-Maori populations. However, only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations. Loss of E-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers, and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal cancer. Thus, CDH1 should be investigated as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancers.
Inherited mutations of the APC gene predispose carriers to multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon and rectum and to colorectal cancer. Mutations located at the extreme 5 end of the APC gene, however, are associated with a less severe disease known as attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC). Many individuals with AAPC develop relatively few colorectal polyps but are still at high risk for colorectal cancer. We report here the identification of a 5 APC germline mutation in five separately ascertained AAPC families from Newfoundland, Canada. This disease-causing mutation is a single basepair change (G to A) in the splice-acceptor region of APC intron 3 that creates a mutant RNA without exon 4 of APC. The observation of the same APC mutation in five families from the same geographic area demonstrates a founder effect. Furthermore, the identification of this germline mutation strengthens the correlation between the 5 location of an APC disease-causing mutation and the attenuated polyposis phenotype..

Interleukin 21 (IL-21) is a recently identified novel cytokine that plays an important role in the regulation of B, T, and NK cell functions. Its effects depend on binding to and signaling through an IL-21 receptor complex consisting of the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) and the common gamma-chain (gamma(c)). In this study using biosensor technique, the ligand-binding properties of IL-21R and gamma(c), which are presently poorly understood on a molecular level, were analyzed employing recombinant ectodomains of IL-21R and gamma(c). The formation of a binary complex between IL-21 and immobilized IL-21R (K(D) 70pM), gamma(c) and immobilized IL-21 (K(D) 160 microM) and a ternary complex between gamma(c) and IL-21 saturated immobilized IL-21R (K(D) 160nM) could be analyzed. The gamma(c) residues involved in IL-21 binding were defined by alanine-scanning mutational analysis. The epitope comprises gamma(c) residues N44, Y103, N128, L161, E162, and L208. It is not identical but partially overlapping with the previously established gamma(c) epitope for IL-4 binding. These results open the way to understand the molecular recognition mechanism in the IL-21 receptor system and also the promiscuous binding properties of gamma(c).
Interleukin 21 and its receptor are involved in NK cell expansion and regulation of lymphocyte function.
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) interacts with cells through two types of binding molecules, IL-1 type I receptor (IL-1R I) and IL-1R II. The function of IL-1R II is unknown. In studies using monoclonal antibodies, IL-1 prolonged the in vitro survival of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) through IL-1R I, and IL-4 antagonized the action of IL-1 by inducing expression and release of IL-1R II. Dexamethasone also induced expression and release of the IL-1R II in PMN. These results, together with the effect of antibodies to IL-1R on IL-1-induced production of cytokines in monocytes, indicate that IL-1 acts on myelomonocytic cells through IL-1R I and that IL-1R II inhibits IL-1 activity by acting as a decoy target for IL-1. The existence of multiple pathways of regulation emphasizes the need for tight control of IL-1 action.
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a proinflammatory cytokine that elicits its pleiotropic effects through activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1. Binding of IL-1 to its receptor results in rapid assembly of a membrane-proximal signalling complex that consists of two different receptor chains (IL-1Rs), IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP, the adaptor protein MyD88, the serine/threonine kinase IRAK and a new protein, which we have named Tollip. Here we show that, before IL-1beta treatment, Tollip is present in a complex with IRAK, and that recruitment of Tollip-IRAK complexes to the activated receptor complex occurs through association of Tollip with IL-1RAcP. Co-recruited MyD88 then triggers IRAK autophosphorylation, which in turn leads to rapid dissociation of IRAK from Tollip (and IL-1Rs). As overexpression of Tollip results in impaired NF-kappaB activation, we conclude that Tollip is an important constituent of the IL-1R signalling pathway.
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are central components of Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) signaling pathways. In an attempt to discover novel signal transducers in TIR signaling, we identified human Pellino2 as an interaction partner of IRAK4. Pellino2 interacts with kinase-active as well as kinase-inactive IRAK1 and IRAK4. Furthermore, Pellino2 is one of the first substrates identified for IRAK1 and IRAK4. Functional studies using overexpression or RNAi knock-down of Pellino2 suggest a role of Pellino2 as a scaffolding protein similar to Pellino1. However, unlike Pellino1, Pellino2 does not seem to activate a specific transcription factor, but links TIR signaling to basic cellular processes.
Interleukin-1 type II receptor: a decoy target for IL-1 that is regulated by IL-4.
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) binds to two distinct receptor molecules, the IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha, p55) chain and the newly identified IL-2 receptor beta (IL-2R beta, p70-75) chain. The cDNA encoding the human IL-2R beta chain has now been isolated. The overall primary structure of the IL-2R beta chain shows no apparent homology to other known receptors. Unlike the IL-2R alpha chain, the IL-2R beta chain has a large cytoplasmic region in which a functional domain (or domains) mediating an intracellular signal transduction pathway (or pathways) may be embodied. The cDNA-encoded beta chain binds and internalizes IL-2 when expressed on T lymphoid cells but not fibroblast cells. Furthermore, the cDNA gives rise to the generation of high-affinity IL-2 receptor when co-expressed with the IL-2R alpha chain cDNA.

Interstitial cytogenetic deletions involving the paternally derived chromosome 15q11-13 have been described in patients with the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We report a child with PWS and a de novo unbalanced karyotype -45, XY, -9, -15, + der (9) t (9; 15) (q34; q13). Molecular studies with the DNA probe pML34 confirmed that only a single Prader Willi critical region (PWCR 15q11. 2-q12) copy was present. Hybridisation of patient and parental DNA with the multi-allelic probe CMW1, which maps to pter-15q13, showed that the chromosome involved in the translocation was paternal in origin. This is the first example of a paternally-derived PWCR allele loss caused by an unbalanced translocation that has arisen de novo.
Interstrain variation in acute toxic response to caffeine among inbred mice.
Intestinal uptake of dietary glucose and galactose is mediated by the SGLT1 Na +/glucose cotransporter of the brush border. An SGLT1 missense mutation underlies hereditary glucose/galactose malabsorption, characterized by potentially fatal diarrhea; conversely, oral rehydration therapy exploits normal transport to alleviate life-threatening diarrhea of infectious origin. We have mapped the entire human SGLT1 Na +/glucose cotransporter gene from cosmid and lambda phage clones representing a genomic region of 112 kilobases. Transcription initiation occurred from a site 27 base pairs 3 of a TATAA sequence. All exon-flanking regions were sequenced, and the entire 112-kilobase region mapped with four restriction enzymes. SGLT1 is comprised of 15 exons (spanning 72 kilobases); a possible evolutionary origin from a six-membrane-span ancestral precursor via a gene duplication event is suggested from comparison of exons against protein secondary structure and from sequence considerations. A new missense mutation in exon 1 causing glucose/galactose malabsorption is also described. This is the first Na (+) -dependent cotransporter gene structure reported. These data facilitate the search for new glucose/galactose malabsorption-related mutations in this important gene and provide a basis for future evolutionary comparisons with other Na (+) -dependent cotransporters..

Intracerebroventricular injection of ethacrynic acid (50% convulsive dose; 50 micrograms/mouse) accelerated the synthesis/turnover of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) but suppressed the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid and acetylcholine in mouse brain. These effects were completely antagonized by pretreatment with a glutamate/N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, aminophosphonovaleric acid. In ethacrynic acid-induced convulsions, these neurotransmitter systems may be differentially modulated, probably through activation of glutaminergic neurons in the brain.
Intracranial aneurysms and cocaine abuse: analysis of prognostic indicators.
Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured during alfentanil-induced rigidity in rats. Ten rats had arterial, central venous (CVP), and subdural cannulae inserted under halothane anesthesia. The animals were mechanically ventilated to achieve normocarbia (PCO2 = 42 +/- 1 mmHg, mean +/- SE). Following instrumentation, halothane was discontinued and alfentanil (125 mu/kg) administered iv during emergence from halothane anesthesia. In the five rats that developed somatic rigidity, ICP and CVP increased significantly above baseline (delta ICP 7.5 +/- 1.0 mmHg, delta CVP 5.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg). These variables returned to baseline when rigidity was abolished with metocurine. In five rats that did not become rigid, ICP and CVP did not change following alfentanil. These observations suggest that rigidity should be prevented when alfentanil, and, presumably, other opiates, are used in the anesthetic management of patients with ICP problems.
Intracranial pressure increases during alfentanil-induced rigidity.
Intradermal glutamate and capsaicin injections: intra- and interindividual variability of provoked hyperalgesia and allodynia.
Intradermal injections of glutamate and capsaicin are attractive to use in human experimental pain models because hyperalgesia and allodynia mimic isolated aspects of clinical pain disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate the reproducibility of these models. Twenty healthy male volunteers (mean age 24 years; range 18-38 years) received intradermal injections of glutamate and capsaicin in the volar forearm. Magnitudes of secondary pinprick hyperalgesia and brush-evoked allodynia were investigated using von Frey filaments (gauges 10, 15, 60 and 100 g) and brush strokes. Areas of secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia were quantified immediately after injection and after 15, 30 and 60 min. Two identical experiments separated by at least 7 days were performed. Reproducibility across and within volunteers (inter- and intra-individual variation, respectively) was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV). Secondary pinprick hyperalgesia was observed as a marked increase in the visual analogue scale (VAS) response to von Frey gauges 60 and 100 g (P < 0.001) after glutamate injection. For capsaicin, secondary pinprick hyperalgesia was detected with all von Frey gauges (P < 0.001). Glutamate evoked reproducible VAS response to all von Frey gauges (ICC > 0.60) and brush strokes (ICC > 0.83). Capsaicin injection was reproducible for secondary hyperalgesia (ICC > 0.70) and allodynia (ICC > 0.71). Intra-individual variability was generally lower for the VAS response to von Frey and brush compared with areas of secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia. In conclusion, glutamate and capsaicin yield reproducible hyperalgesic and allodynic responses, and the present model is well suited for basic research, as well as for assessing the modulation of central phenomena.

Intraperitoneal administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulphate ester (CCK-8-SE) and nonsulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8-NS) enhanced the latency of seizures induced by picrotoxin in mice. Experiments with N- and C-terminal fragments revealed that the C-terminal tetrapeptide (CCK-5-8) was the active centre of the CCK octapeptide molecule. The analogues CCK-8-SE and CCK-8-NS (dose range 0.2-6.4 mumol/kg) and caerulein dose range 0.1-0.8 mumol/kg) showed bell-shaped dose-effect curves, with the greatest maximum inhibition for CCK-8-NS. The peptide CCK-5-8 had weak anticonvulsant activity in comparison to the octapeptides, 3.2 mumol/kg and larger doses of the reference drug, diazepam, totally prevented picrotoxin-induced seizures and mortality. The maximum effect of the peptides tested was less than that of diazepam. Experiments with analogues and derivatives of CCK-5-8 demonstrated that the effectiveness of the beta-alanyl derivatives of CCK-5-8 were enhanced and that they were equipotent with CCK-8-SE. Of the CCK-2-8 analogues, Ser(SO3H)7-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE and Thr(SO3H)7-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE and Hyp(SO3H)-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE were slightly more active than CCK-8-SE.

Irinotecan is an anti-neoplastic agent that is widely used for treating colorectal and lung cancers, but often causes toxicities such as severe myelosuppression and diarrhea. In this study, we performed a two-stage case-control association study for irinotecan-induced severe myelosuppression (grades 3 and 4). In the first stage, 23 patients who developed severe myelosuppression and 58 patients who did not develop any toxicity were examined for 170 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 genes involved in the metabolism and transport of irinotecan. A total of five SNPs were identified to show the possible association with severe myelosuppression (P(Fisher)<0.01) and were further examined in 7 cases and 20 controls in the second stage of the study. An intronic SNP, rs2622604, in ABCG2 showed P(Fisher)=0.0419 in the second stage and indicated a significant association with severe myelosuppression in the combined study (P(Fisher)=0.000237; P(Corrected)=0.036). Although only limited subjects were investigated, our results suggested that a genetic polymorphism in ABCG2 might alter the transport activity for the drug and elevate the systemic circulation level of irinotecan, leading to severe myelosuppression.
Iron accumulation is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral iron overload and dopaminergic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra (SN), in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, Perls' iron staining, and high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection to study the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and increased iron content in the SN of iron dextran overloaded animals. The findings showed that peripheral iron dextran overload increased the iron staining positive cells and reduced the number of TH-immunoreactive neurons in the SN. As a result, dopamine release and content, as well as its metabolites contents were decreased in caudate putamen. Even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload group. These results suggest that peripheral iron dextran can increase the iron level in the SN, where excessive iron causes the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The chronic iron overload may be more destructive to dopaminergic neurons than the acute iron overload.

Isolation of cDNA clones for human leukotriene B4 (LTB4) omega-hydroxylase clearly demonstrates that the hydroxylase is a member of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) superfamily. cDNA clones isolated from a human leukocyte cDNA library with CYP4A4 cDNA as a probe encode a protein of 520 amino acids with a molecular weight of 59,805. The deduced amino acid sequence contains an invariant cysteine in the conserved heme-binding domain near the C terminus, characteristic of the P-450 superfamily. The microsomes from yeast cells transfected with an expression vector pAAH5 carrying isolated cDNA catalyzed the omega-hydroxylation of LTB4 with a Km value of 0.71 microM, and its activity was significantly inhibited by carbon monoxide and by antisera against CYP4A4, consistent with the properties previously reported with LTB4 omega-hydroxylase in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The amino acid sequence of LTB4 omega-hydroxylase (P-450LTB omega) shows 31-44% similarity to those of CYP4A, CYP4B, and CYP4C, whereas less than 25% similarity was observed with any of the other P-450 families. According to the systematic classification of the P-450 superfamily, P-450LTB omega is classified into the CYP4 family but does not belong to any of the known CYP4 subfamilies. This P-450 composes a new subfamily of CYP4. RNA blot analysis indicated that mRNA hybridized to the cDNA was expressed in the polymorphonuclear leukocytes as well as leukocytes from four individuals. Isolation of the cDNA opens the way to investigate the physiological role and to regulation of the omega-hydroxylase in the inflammation process.

It has been consistently shown that ecstasy users display impairments in learning and memory performance. In addition, working memory processing in ecstasy users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and/or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using functional imaging and a face-learning task, we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face-name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was ecstasy and 20 controls. To address the potential confounding effects of the cannabis use of the ecstasy using group, a second analysis included 14 previously tested cannabis users (Nestor, L., Roberts, G., Garavan, H., Hester, R., 2008. Deficits in learning and memory: parahippocampal hyperactivity and frontocortical hypoactivity in cannabis users. Neuroimage 40, 1328-1339). Ecstasy users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and cannabis users. A conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed ecstasy-specific hyperactivity in bilateral frontal regions, left temporal, right parietal, bilateral temporal, and bilateral occipital brain regions. Ecstasy-specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) and left posterior cingulated cortex. In both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate. These results elucidated ecstasy-related deficits, only some of which might be attributed to cannabis use. These ecstasy-specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the neurotoxic effects of ecstasy.
It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to coronary occlusion and to critical coronary stenoses in the presence of hyperemic stimulation. The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of coronary stenosis. The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual-perfusion technique and with thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). During a transient (20-s) coronary occlusion, a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced. The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.74; p less than 0.002). During dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography. The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild (0% to 50%) reduction in dipyridamole-induced hyperemia. The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.61; p = 0.02). Thallium-201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03). Thus, myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of coronary stenosis. The results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with thallium-201 SPECT.
It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma potassium can alter the tendency towards cardiac arrhythmias. If this were so, patients with coronary artery disease might be especially susceptible. Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium-conserving diuretic (amiloride) and a similar period on a potassium-losing diuretic (chlorthalidone) in a randomised study. Plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol/L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy. Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight, plasma renin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens. Compared to amiloride treatment, the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats (24-hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation. The above results indicate that because potassium-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease, even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients.
It has been proposed that nitric oxide (NO) induced headache in primary headaches may be associated with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during headache induced by the NO donor glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) in 16 patients with chronic tension-type headache and 16 healthy controls. The subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0.5 microg/kg/min GTN or placebo over 20 min on two headache-free days. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 10, 20 and 60 min after start of infusion. Both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate headache on the GTN day than on the placebo day and the headache was significantly more pronounced in patients than in controls. There was no difference between the area under the CGRP curve (AUCCGRP) on GTN vs. placebo day in either patients (P=0.65) or controls (P=0.48). The AUCCGRP recorded on the GTN day did not differ between patients and controls (P=0.36). Both in patients and controls, CGRP levels changed significantly over time, on both the GTN and placebo days (P < 0.05). The present study indicates that NO-induced immediate headache is not associated with release of CGRP.
It has been shown from pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) that the monoamine oxidase genes A and B (MAOA & MAOB) and DXS7 loci are physically very close. We have therefore extended studies on their relationship through the characterisation of a 650 kb YAC isolated using L1. 28 (recognising the DXS7 locus) as a probe. Restriction mapping of the YAC indicates that it contains both MAOA and MAOB genes in addition to the DXS7 locus. The map derived from the YL1. 28-YAC is compatible both with the map from an independently derived YAC carrying MAOA and B genes and with the long range genomic map for the region. A series of subclones prepared from a phage library (lambda DASH II) of the YAC have been characterised and have been employed to determine the end point of the deletion of a Norrie disease (NDP) patient who has been shown to lack both DXS7 and MAO coding sequences. The pattern of retention of subclones in the deletion patient place the end point of the deletion within 30-130 kb of the proximal end of the YAC. By combining the data with established recombination analysis, we provide evidence that all or part of the NDP lies in the interval of approximately 250kb within the YAC.
It has been shown that bromocriptine-induced tachycardia, which persisted after adrenalectomy, is (i) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and (ii) reduced by 5-day isoproterenol pretreatment, supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart. This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats. Isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate. In control rats, intravenous bromocriptine (150 microg/kg) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia. Bromocriptine-induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment, while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia, an effect that was partly reduced by i.v. domperidone (0.5 mg/kg). Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment. In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol-pretreated rats, the isoproterenol-induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced, compared with saline-pretreated rats (the EC50 of the isoproterenol-induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22-fold). These results show that 15-day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine-induced tachycardia to bradycardia, an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart. They suggest that, in normal conscious rats, the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine D2 receptors.
It has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypothyroidism during lithium treatment. We measured serum thyroxine and urine-concentrating ability (Umax) in response to desmopressin (DDAVP) in 85 patients receiving lithium. Hypothyroidism developed in eight patients while they were taking lithium. Impaired Umax was found in both euthyroid and hypothyroid patients while some hypothyroid patients concentrated their urine well. It is concluded that the dominant mechanisms by which lithium exerts these two effects are different.
It has been suggested that the human C1qRp is a receptor for the complement component C1q; however, there is no direct evidence for an interaction between C1q and C1qRp. In this study, we demonstrate that C1q does not show enhanced binding to C1qRp-transfected cells compared with control cells. Furthermore, a soluble recombinant C1qRp-Fc chimera failed to interact with immobilized C1q. The proposed role of C1qRp in the phagocytic response in vivo is also unsupported in that we demonstrate that this molecule is not expressed by macrophages in a variety of human tissues and the predominant site of expression is on endothelial cells. Studies on the rodent homolog of C1qRp, known as AA4, have suggested that this molecule may function as an intercellular adhesion molecule. Here we show that C1qRp is the Ag recognized by several previously described mAbs, mNI-11 and two anti-CD93 Abs (clones X2 and VIMD2b). Interestingly, mNI-11 (Fab') has been shown to promote monocyte-monocyte and monocyte-endothelial cell adhesive interactions. We produced a recombinant C1qRp-Fc chimera containing the C-type lectin-like domain of C1qRp and found specific binding to vascular endothelial cells in sections of inflamed human tonsil, indicating the presence of a C1qRp ligand at this site. This interaction was Ca(2+) independent and was not blocked by our anti-C1qRp mAb BIIG-4, but was blocked by the proadhesive mAb mNI-11. Collectively, these data indicate that C1qRp is not a receptor for C1q, and they support the emerging role of C1qRp (here renamed CD93) in functions relevant to intercellular adhesion.
It is known that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of akathisia, one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment. Neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, a model of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects, was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic-induced akathisia in humans, although neuroleptic-induced catalepsy was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Therefore, the effects of carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and biperiden, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Carteolol, as well as propranolol and biperiden, inhibited the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The inhibitory effect of carteolol was almost comparable to that of propranolol, but was weaker than that of biperiden. Carteolol did not evoke postsynaptic dopamine receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and hyperlocomotion in rats. Carteolol did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of haloperidol on apomorphine-induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats. In addition, carteolol did not evoke 5-HT1A receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitch in rats. Finally, carteolol did not inhibit physostigmine-induced lethality in rats. These results strongly suggest that carteolol improves haloperidol-induced catalepsy via its beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of akathisia without attenuating neuroleptic-induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic dopamine receptor antagonistic activity.
It is well known that ceftriaxone leads to pseudolithiasis in some patients. Clinical and experimental studies also suggest that situations causing gallbladder dysfunction, such as fasting, may have a role for the development of pseudolithiasis. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients receiving ceftriaxone treatment, who often had to fast in the post-operative period. Fifty children who were given ceftriaxone were evaluated by serial abdominal sonograms. Of those, 13 (26%) developed biliary pathology. Comparison of the patients with or without pseudolithiasis revealed no significant difference with respect to age, sex, duration of the treatment and starvation variables. After cessation of the treatment, pseudolithiasis resolved spontaneously within a short period. The incidence of pseudolithiasis is not affected by fasting.
It is widely believed that dopamine (DA) mediates methamphetamine (METH)-induced toxicity to brain dopaminergic neurons, because drugs that interfere with DA neurotransmission decrease toxicity, whereas drugs that increase DA neurotransmission enhance toxicity. However, temperature effects of drugs that have been used to manipulate brain DA neurotransmission confound interpretation of the data. Here we show that the recently reported ability of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine to reverse the protective effect of alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine on METH-induced DA neurotoxicity is also confounded by drug effects on body temperature. Further, we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain DA develop METH neurotoxicity, as long as the thermic effects of METH are preserved. In addition, we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain DA deficits develop METH-induced dopaminergic deficits that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of the brain. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that DA is not essential for the development of METH-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and suggest that mechanisms independent of DA warrant more intense investigation.
It was reported that there was a case of severe malaria patient with jaundice who presented with arrhythmia (premature ventricular contraction) while getting quinine infusion was reported. A man, 25 years old, was admitted to hospital with high fever, chill, vomiting, jaundice. The patient was fully conscious, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse rate 100 x/minute, regular. On admission, laboratory examination showed Plasmodium falciparum (++++), total bilirubin 8.25 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin 4.36 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin 3.89 mg/dL, potassium 3.52 meq/L Patient was diagnosed as severe malaria with jaundice and got quinine infusion in dextrose 5% 500 mg/8 hour. On the second day the patient had vomitus, diarrhea, tinnitus, loss of hearing. After 30 hours of quinine infusion the patient felt palpitation and electrocardiography (ECG) recording showed premature ventricular contraction (PVC) > 5 x/minute, trigemini, constant type--sinoatrial block, positive U wave. He was treated with lidocaine 50 mg intravenously followed by infusion 1500 mg in dextrose 5%/24 hour and potassium aspartate tablet. Quinine infusion was discontinued and changed with sulfate quinine tablets. Three hours later the patient felt better, the frequency of PVC reduced to 4 - 5 x/minute and on the third day ECG was normal, potassium level was 3.34 meq/L. He was discharged on 7th day in good condition. Quinine, like quinidine, is a chincona alkaloid that has anti-arrhythmic property, although it also pro-arrhythmic that can cause various arrhythmias, including severe arrhythmia such as multiple PVC. Administration of parenteral quinine must be done carefully and with good observation because of its pro-arrhythmic effect, especially in older patients who have heart diseases or patients with electrolyte disorder (hypokalemia) which frequently occurs due to vomiting and or diarrhea in malaria cases.
JEM-1, a novel gene encoding a leucine-zipper nuclear factor upregulated during retinoid-induced maturation of NB4 promyelocytic leukaemia.
Juvenile retinoschisis is an X-linked recessive disease caused by mutations in the XLRS1 gene. We screened 31 new unrelated patients and families for XLRS1 mutations in addition to previously reported mutations for 60 of our families (Retinoschisis Consortium, Hum Mol Genet 1998; 7 1185-1192). Twenty-three different mutations including 12 novel ones were identified in 28 patients. Mutations identified in this study include 19 missense mutations, two nonsense mutations, one intragenic deletion, four microdeletions, one insertion, and one intronic sequence substitution that is likely to result in a splice site defect. Two novel mutations, c. 38T-- > C (L13P) and c. 667T-- > C (C223R), respectively, present the first genetic evidence for the functional significance of the putative leader peptide sequence and for the functional significance at the carboxyl terminal of the XLRS1 protein beyond the discoidin domain. Mutations in 25 of the families were localized to exons 4-6, emphasizing the critical functional significance of the discoidin domain of the XLRS1 protein

KF17837 is a novel selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist. Oral administration of KF17837 (2.5, 10.0 and 30.0 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated the cataleptic responses induced by intracerebroventricular administration of an adenosine A2A receptor agonist, CGS 21680 (10 micrograms), in a dose-dependent manner. KF17837 also reduced the catalepsy induced by haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.) and by reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p.). These anticataleptic effects were exhibited dose dependently at doses from 0.625 and 2.5 mg/kg p.o., respectively. Moreover, KF17837 (0.625 mg/kg p.o.) potentiated the anticataleptic effects of a subthreshold dose of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA; 25 mg/kg i.p.) plus benserazide (6.25 mg/kg i.p.). These results suggested that KF17837 is a centrally active adenosine A2A receptor antagonist and that the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway is potentiated by adenosine A2A receptor antagonists. Furthermore, KF17837 may be a useful drug in the treatment of parkinsonism.

Ketoconazole induced torsades de pointes without concomitant use of QT interval-prolonging drug.
Ketoconazole is not known to be proarrhythmic without concomitant use of QT interval-prolonging drugs. We report a woman with coronary artery disease who developed a markedly prolonged QT interval and torsades de pointes (TdP) after taking ketoconazole for treatment of fungal infection. Her QT interval returned to normal upon withdrawal of ketoconazole. Genetic study did not find any mutation in her genes that encode cardiac IKr channel proteins. We postulate that by virtue of its direct blocking action on IKr, ketoconazole alone may prolong QT interval and induce TdP. This calls for attention when ketoconazole is administered to patients with risk factors for acquired long QT syndrome.
Ketoconazole was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1981. By November 1984 the Committee on Safety of Medicines had received 82 reports of possible hepatotoxicity associated with the drug, including five deaths. An analysis of the 75 cases that had been adequately followed up suggested that 16, including three deaths, were probably related to treatment with the drug. Of the remainder, 48 were possibly related to treatment, five were unlikely to be so, and six were unclassifiable. The mean age of patients in the 16 probable cases was 57.9, with hepatotoxicity being more common in women. The average duration of treatment before the onset of jaundice was 61 days. None of these well validated cases occurred within the first 10 days after treatment. The results of serum liver function tests suggested hepatocellular injury in 10 (63%); the rest showed a mixed pattern. In contrast, the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of cholestasis. The characteristics of the 48 patients in the possible cases were similar. Allergic manifestations such as rash and eosinophilia were rare. Hepatitis was usually reversible when treatment was stopped, with the results of liver function tests returning to normal after an average of 3.1 months. In two of the three deaths probably associated with ketoconazole treatment the drug had been continued after the onset of jaundice and other symptoms of hepatitis. Clinical and biochemical monitoring at regular intervals for evidence of hepatitis is advised during long term treatment with ketoconazole to prevent possible serious hepatic injury.
Ketoconazole-induced neurologic sequelae.
Kidney development occurs in a stereotypic position along the body axis. It begins when a single ureteric bud emerges from the nephric duct in response to GDNF secreted by the adjacent nephrogenic mesenchyme. Posterior restriction of Gdnf expression is considered critical for correct positioning of ureteric bud development. Here we show that mouse mutants lacking either SLIT2 or its receptor ROBO2, molecules known primarily for their function in axon guidance and cell migration, develop supernumerary ureteric buds that remain inappropriately connected to the nephric duct, and that the SLIT2/ROBO2 signal is transduced in the nephrogenic mesenchyme. Furthermore, we show that Gdnf expression is inappropriately maintained in anterior nephrogenic mesenchyme in these mutants. Thus our data identify an intercellular signaling system that restricts, directly or indirectly, the extent of the Gdnf expression domain, thereby precisely positioning the site of kidney induction.

Kniest dysplasia is a moderately severe chondrodysplasia phenotype that results from mutations in the gene for type II collagen, COL2A1. Characteristics of the disorder include a short trunk and extremities, mid-face hypoplasia, cleft palate, myopia, retinal detachment, and hearing loss. Recently, deletions of all or part of exon 12 have been identified in individuals with Kniest dysplasia, suggesting that mutations within this region of the protein may primarily result in the Kniest dysplasia phenotype. We used SSCP to analyze an amplified genomic DNA fragment containing exon 12 from seven individuals with Kniest dysplasia. An abnormality was identified in one patient. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that the patient was heterozygous for a G to A transition that implied substitution of glycine103 of the triple helical domain by aspartate. The mutation was not observed in DNA from either of the clinically unaffected parents of the proband. Protein microsequencing demonstrated expression of the abnormal allele in cartilage. These data demonstrate that point mutations which result in single amino acid substitutions can produce Kniest dysplasia and further support the hypothesis that alteration of a domain, which includes the region encoded by exon 12, in the type II collagen protein leads to this disorder..
Kniest dysplasia is a moderately severe type II collagenopathy, characterized by short trunk and limbs, kyphoscoliosis, midface hypoplasia, severe myopia, and hearing loss. Mutations in the gene that encodes type II collagen (COL2A1), the predominant protein of cartilage, have been identified in a number of individuals with Kniest dysplasia. All but two of these previously described mutations cause in-frame deletions in type II collagen, either by small deletions in the gene or splice site alterations. Furthermore, all but one of these mutations is located between exons 12 and 24 in the COL2A1 gene. We used heteroduplex analysis to identify sequence anomalies in five individuals with Kniest dysplasia. Sequencing of the index patients genomic DNA identified four new dominant mutations in COL2A1 that result in Kniest dysplasia a 21-bp deletion in exon 16, an 18-bp deletion in exon 19, and 4-bp deletions in the splice donor sites of introns 14 and 20. A previously described 28-bp deletion at the COL2A1 exon 12-intron 12 junction, deleting the splice donor site, was identified in the fifth case. The latter three mutations are predicted to result in exon skipping in the mRNA encoded from the mutant allele. These data suggest that Kniest dysplasia results from shorter type II collagen monomers, and support the hypothesis that alteration of a specific COL2A1 domain, which may span from exons 12 to 24, leads to the Kniest dysplasia phenotype..
Kniest dysplasia is a severe chondrodysplasia caused by the defective formation of type II collagen. We report about Dr. Kniest, who first described the condition in 1952, and his patient, who, at the age of 50 years is severely handicapped with short stature, restricted joint mobility, and blindness but is mentally alert and leads an active life. Molecular analysis of the patients DNA showed a single base (G) deletion involving the GT dinucleotide at the start of intron 18 destroying a splice site of the COL2A1 gene. This is in accordance with molecular findings in other patients with Kniest dysplasia and confirms, in the original patient, that the disorder is caused by small inframe deletions often due to exon skipping as a result of COL2A1 splice site mutations..

Knobloch syndrome (KS) is an autosomal recessive disorder defined by the occurrence of high myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration with retinal detachment, macular abnormalities and occipital encephalocele. The KS causative gene had been assigned to a 4.3 cM interval at 21q22.3 by linkage analysis of a large consanguineous Brazilian family. We reconstructed the haplotypes of this family with ten additional markers (five were novel) and narrowed the candidate interval to a region of < 245 kb, which contains 24 expressed sequence tags, the KIAA0958 gene and the 5' end of the COL18A1 gene. We identified a homozygous mutation at the AG consensus acceptor splice site of COL18A1 intron 1 exclusively among the 12 KS patients, which was not found among 140 control chromosomes. This mutation predicts the creation of a stop codon in exon 4 and therefore the truncation of the alpha1(XVIII) collagen short form, which was expressed in human adult retina. These findings provide evidence that KS is caused by mutations in COL18A1 which, therefore, has a major role in determining the retinal structure as well as in the closure of the neural tube. Therefore, we show for the first time that the absence of a collagen isoform impairs embryonic cell proliferation and/or migration as a primary or secondary effect.

Ksp-cadherin is a novel kidney-specific member of the cadherin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. We have determined the complete cDNA coding sequences of both the human and the mouse isoforms of Ksp-cadherin. The inferred amino acid sequences of the human and mouse isoforms are 79 and 75% identical to the originally described rabbit isoform of Ksp-cadherin (Thomson et al., 1995; J. Biol. Chem. 270, 17594-17601), respectively. The relative locations of cadherin-specific sequence motifs, putative N-glycosylation sites, and characteristic protein domains are entirely conserved in all three isoforms. Multiple organ Northern analyses indicate that, as in the rabbit, both the human and the mouse Ksp-cadherin transcripts appear to have distinct kidney-specific distributions. The human Ksp-cadherin gene (CDH16) maps to chromosome 16q21-proximal 16q22. The mouse Ksp-cadherin gene (Cdh16) was localized to a highly syntenic region of distal Chromosome 8. Both the human and the mouse Ksp-cadherin genes were localized to previously identified clusters of cadherin gene sequences, consistent with the hypothesis that most cadherin family members arose by gene duplication from a single ancestral gene at a relatively early stage in the evolution of the mammalian genome.

Kv4.2 potassium channels play a critical role in postsynaptic excitability. Immunocytochemical studies reveal a somatodendritic Kv4.2 expression pattern, with the channels concentrated mainly at dendritic spines. The molecular mechanism that underlies the localization of Kv4.2 to this subcellular region is unknown. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the Kv4.2-associated proteins that are involved in channel localization. Here we demonstrate a direct interaction between Kv4.2 and the actin-binding protein, filamin. We show that Kv4.2 and filamin can be coimmunoprecipitated both in vitro and in brain and that Kv4.2 and filamin share an overlapping expression pattern in the cerebellum and cultured hippocampal neurons. To examine the functional consequences of this interaction, we expressed Kv4.2 in filamin(+) and filamin(-) cells and performed immunocytochemical and electrophysiological analyses. Our results indicate that Kv4.2 colocalizes with filamin at filopodial roots in filamin(+) cells but shows a nonspecific expression pattern in filamin(-) cells, with no localization to filopodial roots. Furthermore, the magnitude of whole-cell Kv4.2 current density is approximately 2.7-fold larger in filamin(+) cells as compared with these currents in filamin(-) cells. We propose that filamin may function as a scaffold protein in the postsynaptic density, mediating a direct link between Kv4.2 and the actin cytoskeleton, and that this interaction is essential for the generation of appropriate Kv4.2 current densities.
L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is among the motor complications that arise in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients after a prolonged treatment with L-DOPA. To this day, transcriptome analysis has been performed in a rat model of LID [Neurobiol. Dis., 17 (2004), 219] but information regarding the proteome is still lacking. In the present study, we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesion rat model of PD treated with saline, L-DOPA or bromocriptine using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS). Rats treated with L-DOPA were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of LID. Among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference, 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS, atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and HPLC coupled tandem MS (LC/MS/MS). Out of these 67 proteins, LID significantly changed the expression level of five proteins: alphabeta-crystalin, gamma-enolase, guanidoacetate methyltransferase, vinculin, and proteasome alpha-2 subunit. Complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the protein changes occurring in LID.
L-Dopa (5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased blood pressure and heart rate after extracerebral decarboxylase inhibition with MK-486 (25 mg/kg i.v.) in anesthetize MAO-inhibited dogs. In addition, reflex bradycardia caused by injected norepinephrine was significantly enhanced by L-dopa, DL-Threo-dihydroxyphenylserine had no effect on blood pressure, heart rate or reflex responses to norepinephrine. FLA-63, a dopamine-beta-oxidase inhibitor, did not have any effect on the hypotension, bradycardia or reflex-enhancing effect of L-dopa. Pimozide did not affect the actions of L-dopa on blood pressure and heart rate but completely blocked the enhancement of reflexes. Removal of the carotid sinuses caused an elevation blood pressure and heart rate and abolished the negative chronotropic effect of norepinephrine. However, L-dopa restored the bradycardia caused by norepinephrine in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate. 5-HTP (5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased blood pressure and heart rate and decreased the reflex bradycardia to norepinephrine. It is concluded that L-dopa enhances reflex bradycardia through central alpha-receptor stimulation. Furthermore, the effects are mediated through dopamine rather than norepinephrine and do not require the carotid sinus baroreceptors.

LY274614, 3SR,4aRS,6SR,8aRS-6-[phosphonomethyl]decahydr oisoquinoline-3- carboxylic acid, has been described as a potent antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor. Here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum by amphetamine in iprindole-treated rats is reported. A single 18.4 mg/kg (i.p.) dose of (+/-)-amphetamine hemisulfate, given to rats pretreated with iprindole, resulted in persistent depletion of dopamine in the striatum 1 week later. This prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum was antagonized by dizocilpine (MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors) or by LY274614 (a competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors). The protective effect of LY274614 was dose-dependent, being maximum at 10-40 mgkg (i.p.). A 10 mg/kg dose of LY274614 was effective in antagonizing the depletion of dopamine in the striatum, when given as long as 8 hr prior to amphetamine but not when given 24 hr prior to amphetamine. Depletion of dopamine in the striatum was also antagonized when LY274614 was given after the injection of amphetamine; LY274614 protected when given up to 4 hr after but not when given 8 or 24 hr after amphetamine. The prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum in mice, given multiple injections of methamphetamine, was also antagonized dose-dependently and completely by LY274614. The data strengthen the evidence that the neurotoxic effect of amphetamine and related compounds toward nigrostriatal dopamine neurons involves NMDA receptors and that LY274614 is an NMDA receptor antagonist with long-lasting in vivo effects in rats.
Lack of association between the G protein beta3 subunit gene and essential hypertension in Chinese: a case-control and a family-based study.
Lack of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) results in mental retardation and macroorchidism, seen as the major pathological symptoms in fragile X patients. FMRP is a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein which cosediments with the 60S ribosomal subunit. Recently, two proteins homologous to FMRP were discovered: FXR1 and FXR2. These novel proteins interact with FMRP and with each other and they are also associated with the 60S ribosomal subunit. Here, we studied the expression pattern of the three proteins in brain and testis by immunohistochemistry. In adult brain, FMR1, FXR1 and FXR2 proteins are coexpressed in the cytoplasm of specific differentiated neurons only. However, we observed a different expression pattern in fetal brain as well as in adult and fetal testis, suggesting independent functions for the three proteins in those tissues during embryonic development and adult life.

Lamivudine for the prevention of hepatitis B virus reactivation in hepatitis-B surface antigen (HBSAG) seropositive cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Lamivudine is a novel 2',3'-dideoxy cytosine analogue that has potent inhibitory effects on hepatitis B virus replication in vitro and in vivo. We performed a single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess its effectiveness and safety in Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Forty-two Chinese HBsAg carriers were randomized to receive placebo (6 patients) or lamivudine orally in dosages of 25 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg daily (12 patients for each dosage). The drug was given for 4 weeks. The patients were closely monitored clinically, biochemically, and serologically up to 4 weeks after drug treatment. All 36 patients receiving lamivudine had a decrease in hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA values of >90% (P < .001 compared with placebo). Although 25 mg of lamivudine was slightly less effective than 100 mg (P = .011) and 300 mg (P = .005), it still induced 94% suppression of HBV DNA after the fourth week of therapy. HBV DNA values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 weeks of cessation of therapy. There was no change in the hepatitis B e antigen status or in aminotransferase levels. No serious adverse events were observed. In conclusion, a 4-week course of lamivudine was safe and effective in suppression of HBV DNA in Chinese HBsAg carriers. The suppression was >90% but reversible. Studies with long-term lamivudine administration should be performed to determine if prolonged suppression of HBV DNA can be achieved.

Large doses of glucocorticoids can alter muscle physiology and susceptibility to neuromuscular blocking drugs by mechanisms not clearly understood. We investigated the effects of moderate and large doses of prednisolone on muscle function and pharmacology, and their relationship to changes in muscle size and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) expression. With institutional approval, 35 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to receive daily subcutaneous doses of 10 mg/kg prednisolone (P10 group), 100 mg/kg prednisolone (P100 group), or an equal volume of saline (S group) for 7 days. A fourth group of rats was pair fed (food restricted) with the P100 rats for 7 days (FR group). On Day 8, the nerve-evoked peak twitch tensions, tetanic tensions, and fatigability, and the dose-response curves of d-tubocurarine in the tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs. Rate of body weight gain was depressed in the P100, FR, and P10 groups compared with the S group. Tibialis muscle mass was smaller in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups. The evoked peak twitch and tetanic tensions were less in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups, however, tension per milligram of muscle mass was greater in the P100 group than in the S group. The 50% effective dose of d-tubocurarine (microg/kg) in the tibialis muscle was smaller in the P10 (33.6 +/- 5.4) than in the S (61.9 +/- 5.0) or the P100 (71.3 +/- 9.6) groups. AChR expression was less in the P10 group than in the S group. The evoked tensions correlated with muscle mass (r(2) = 0.32, P < 0.001), however, not with expression of AChR. The 50% effective dose of d-tubocurarine did not correlate with muscle mass or AChR expression. Our results suggest that the neuromuscular dysfunction after prednisolone is dose-dependent, and derives primarily from muscle atrophy and derives less so from changes in AChR expression. IMPLICATIONS: The mechanisms by which chronic glucocorticoid therapy alters neuromuscular physiology and pharmacology are unclear. We suggest that the observed effects are dose-dependent and derive primarily from muscle atrophy and derive less from changes in acetylcholine receptor expression.
Large doses of triazolam repeatedly induced brief episodes of mania in a depressed elderly woman. Features of organic mental disorder (delirium) were not present. Manic excitement was coincident with the duration of action of triazolam. The possible contribution of the triazolo group to changes in affective status is discussed.

Large intergenerational repeat expansions of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the HD gene have been well documented for the male germline. We describe a recurrent large expansion of a maternal allele with 36 CAG repeats (to 66 and 57 repeats, respectively, in two daughters) associated with onset of Huntington disease (HD) in the second and third decade in a family without history of HD. Our findings give evidence of a gonadal mosaicism in the unaffected mother. We hypothesize that large expansions also occur in the female germline and that a negative selection of oocytes with long repeats might explain the different instability behavior of the male and the female germlines..
Large parenteral doses of vitamin D3 (15 to 17.5 x 10(6) IU vitamin D3) were associated with prolonged hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and large increases of vitamin D3 and its metabolites in the blood plasma of nonlactating nonpregnant and pregnant Jersey cows. Calcium concentrations 1 day postpartum were higher in cows treated with vitamin D3 about 32 days prepartum (8.8 mg/100 ml) than in control cows (5.5 mg/100 ml). None of the cows treated with vitamin D3 showed signs of milk fever during the peripartal period; however, 22% of the control cows developed clinical signs of milk fever during this period. Signs of vitamin D3 toxicity were not observed in nonlactating nonpregnant cows; however, pregnant cows commonly developed severe signs of vitamin D3 toxicity and 10 of 17 cows died. There was widespread metastatic calcification in the cows that died. Because of the extreme toxicity of vitamin D3 in pregnant Jersey cows and the low margin of safety between doses of vitamin D3 that prevent milk fever and doses that induce milk fever, we concluded that vitamin D3 cannot be used practically to prevent milk fever when injected several weeks prepartum.

Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative disorders and in both diseases susceptibility is known to be influenced by genes. We set out to identify novel susceptibility genes for LOAD by performing a large scale, multi-tiered association study testing 4692 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). We identified a SNP within a putative transcription factor binding site in the NEDD9 gene (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated), that shows good evidence of association with disease risk in four out of five LOAD samples [N = 3521, P = 5.38x10(-6), odds ratio (OR) = 1.38 (1.20-1.59)] and in addition, we observed a similar pattern of association in two PD sample sets [N = 1464, P = 0.0145, OR =1.31 (1.05-1.62)]. In exploring a potential mechanism for the association, we observed that expression of NEDD9 and APOE show a strong inverse correlation in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's cases. These data implicate NEDD9 as a novel susceptibility gene for LOAD and possibly PD.

Lead and lead compounds play a significant role in modern industry; a wide variety of population is at risk of occupational exposure and lead is suspected to be a human carcinogen. The biochemical and molecular mechanisms of lead toxicity are poorly understood, but emerging data suggest that some of the effects of lead may be due to its interference with calcium in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and/or through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Many of these results are conducted in vitro on cell lines or ex vivo on human lymphocytes treated in vitro. We, therefore, performed a study on the induction of DNA damage, using the alkaline comet assay, in lymphocytes of battery plant workers. To elucidate in vivo the mechanism(s) responsible for this effect, we determined ROS production, and glutathione (GSH) levels in living cells using the fluorescent probe (2',7'-dichlorofluorescein and monochlorobimane, respectively). Subcellular fractions were obtained from sonicated lymphocytes; cytosolic and membrane expression of PKC isoforms (alpha, and zeta) was evaluated after electrophoresis by immunoblot analysis. The results indicate that lead-exposed workers have significantly elevated levels of DNA breaks compared to the unexposed group. A multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that the most common confounding factors (smoking, drinking and age) have no synergistic effects with lead-exposure on the comet parameters or on GSH levels and ROS production. The logistic regression analysis distinguishing the exposed and non-exposed indicates that only GSH with tail moment are selected as significant risk factors. There is a significant positive correlation with ROS production and negative correlation with GSH levels. The content of PKC alpha in cytosol and membranes is decreased 40% (indicating a down-regulation of protein), whereas PKC zeta isoform is not modified in an evident manner. Our results suggest that lead-exposure induces an increase of DNA breakage with an alternate cellular redox state and a significant down-regulation of PKC alpha, suggesting that this metal may act as a tumor promoter.

Lenalidomide and dexamethasone (RD) is a standard of care for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), but there is limited published data on its efficacy and safety in the "real world" (RW), according to the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research definition. We studied 212 RRMM patients who received RD in RW. Objective response (>PR (partial response)) rate was 77.4 % (complete response (CR), 20.2 %). Median time to first and best response was 2 and 5 months, respectively. Median time to CR when RD was given as 2nd or >2(nd)-line treatment at 4 and 11 months, respectively. Quality of response was independent of previous lines of therapies or previous exposure to thalidomide or bortezomib. Median duration of response was 34.4 months, and it was higher in patients who received RD until progression (not reached versus 19 months, p < 0.001). Improvement of humoral immunity occurred in 60 % of responders (p < 0.001) and in the majority of patients who achieved stable disease. Adverse events were reported in 68.9 % of patients (myelosuppression in 49.4 %) and 12.7 % of patients needed hospitalization. Peripheral neuropathy was observed only in 2.5 % of patients and deep vein thrombosis in 5.7 %. Dose reductions were needed in 31 % of patients and permanent discontinuation in 38.9 %. Median time to treatment discontinuation was 16.8 months. Performance status (PS) and initial lenalidomide dose predicted for treatment discontinuation. Extra-medullary relapses occurred in 3.8 % of patients. Our study confirms that RD is effective and safe in RRMM in the RW; it produces durable responses especially in patients who continue on treatment till progression and improves humoral immunity even in patients with stable disease.
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome caused by a complete deficiency of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) is the result of a heterogeneous group of germ line mutations. Identification of each mutant gene provides valuable information as to the type of mutation that occurs spontaneously. We report here a newly identified HPRT mutation in a Japanese patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This gene, designated HPRT Tokyo, had a single nucleotide change from G to A, as identified by sequencing cDNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization analysis using amplified genomic DNA showed that the mutant gene was transmitted from the maternal germ line. This mutation would lead to an amino acid substitution of Asp for Gly at the amino acid position 140 located within the putative 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) binding region. Missense mutations in human HPRT deficient patients thus far reported tend to accumulate in this functionally active region. However, a comparison of the data suggested that both missense and synonymous mutations can occur at any coding sequence of the human germ line HPRT gene, but that a limited percentage of all the missense mutations cause disease. The probability that a mutation will cause disease tends to be higher when the missense mutation is within a functionally important sequence..

Levodopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the long-term use of this dopamine precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and dyskinesias. Although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying levodopa-induced dyskinesias, their pathogenesis is still unclear. In recent years, evidence from animal models of Parkinson's disease has provided important information to understand the effect of specific receptor and post-receptor molecular mechanisms underlying the development of dyskinetic movements. Recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms, dopamine receptor subtypes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesias.
Levodopa is the most effective symptomatic therapy for Parkinson's disease, but its chronic use could lead to chronic adverse outcomes, such as motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and visual hallucinations. HOMER1 is a protein with pivotal function in glutamate transmission, which has been related to the pathogenesis of these complications. This study investigates whether polymorphisms in the HOMER1 gene promoter region are associated with the occurrence of the chronic complications of levodopa therapy. A total of 205 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were investigated. Patients were genotyped for rs4704559, rs10942891 and rs4704560 by allelic discrimination with Taqman assays. The rs4704559 G allele was associated with a lower prevalence of dyskinesia (prevalence ratio (PR)=0.615, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.426-0.887, P=0.009) and visual hallucinations (PR=0.515, 95% CI 0.295-0.899, P=0.020). Our data suggest that HOMER1 rs4704559 G allele has a protective role for the development of levodopa adverse effects.
Levodopa-induced dyskinesia and thalamotomy.
Levodopa-induced dyskinesia of the limbs in thirteen cases of Parkinsonism, which was choreic, ballistic or dystonic in type, was alleviated almost completely by stereotaxic surgery using a microelectrode technique for the ventralis oralis anterior and posterior nuclei of the thalamus, but much less by the ventralis intermedius nucleus. Control of levodopa-induced dyskinesias by thalamic lesions in the course of routine treatment of Parkinsonism is discussed.
Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) present a major problem for the long-term management of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Due to the interdependence of risk factors in clinical populations, it is difficult to independently examine factors that may influence the development of LIDs. Using macaque monkeys with different types of MPTP-induced parkinsonism, the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression, symptom severity, and response to and duration of levodopa therapy may be involved in the development of LIDs. Monkeys with acute (short-term) MPTP exposure, rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy developed dyskinesia between 11 and 24 days of daily levodopa administration. In contrast, monkeys with long-term MPTP exposure, slow symptom progression and/or long symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy were more resistant to developing LIDs (e.g., dyskinesia developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic levodopa administration). All animals were similarly symptomatic at the start of levodopa treatment and had similar therapeutic responses to the drug. These data suggest distinct differences in the propensity to develop LIDs in monkeys with different rates of symptom progression or symptom durations prior to levodopa and demonstrate the value of these models for further studying the pathophysiology of LIDs.

Levodopa-induced dyskinesias have been reported in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. Cranial dystonias are rare in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In this report we describe an unusual case of reversible levodopa-induced Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) in a PSP patient to highlight the importance of recognizing this drug related complication in the management of PSP, and discuss the possible underlying pathophysiology.

Levodopa-induced ocular dyskinesias are very uncommon. Usually they occur simultaneously with limb peak-dose choreatic dyskinesias. We report on a patient with leftward and upward deviations of gaze during the peak effect of levodopa, and hypothesize that a severe dopaminergic denervation in the caudate nucleus is needed for the appearance of these levodopa-induce ocular dyskinesias.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by various types of cancer in childhood and adult cases. Although hereditary TP53 mutation is very rare in different human cancers, it has been frequently reported in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. On the other hand, hereditary mutations of TP57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A, which affect the cell cycle similar to TP53, were observed in some types of cancer. In a Turkish family with the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, we analyzed the mutation pattern of TP53, P57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A in the peripheral blood, and loss of heterozygosity (homo/hemizygous deletion) pattern of TP53 and P15INK4B/P16INK4A in two tumor tissues. The propositus had a seminoma, his daughter a medulloblastoma, and one of his healthy cousins, a TP53 codon 292 missense point mutation (AAA-- > ATA; Lys-- > Ile) in the peripheral blood cells. Tumor tissue obtained from the propositus with the seminoma revealed loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene. In the analyses of tumor tissues from the propositus and his daughter, a P16INK4A codon 94 missense point mutation (GCG-- > GAG; Ala-- > Glu) was observed with the hereditary TP53 mutation. P16INK4A codon 94 mutation observed in our family is a novel mutation in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. No other gene alteration in TP53, P57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A was observed. Existence of the P16INK4A mutation and the hereditary TP53 mutation with or without loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene (seminoma/medulloblastoma) may be evidence for a common mechanism involved in tumorogenesis. The gene alterations in TP53 and P16INK4A genes may be used as tumor markers in our family..

Light chain proteinuria and cellular mediated immunity in rifampin treated patients with tuberculosis.
Light chain proteinuria was found in 9 of 17 tuberculosis patients treated with rifampin. Concomitant assay of cellular mediated immunity in these patients using skin test antigen and a lymphokine in vitro test provided results that were different. Response to Varidase skin test antigen was negative for all eight tuberculosis patients tested, but there occurred a hyper-responsiveness of the lymphocytes of these eight patients to phytomitogen (PHA-P). as well as of those of seven other tuberculous patients. This last finding may be related to time of testing and/or endogenous serum binding of rifampin which could have inhibited mitogen activity for the lymphocyte.
Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) is an organochlorine insecticide with known neurotoxic effects. Its mechanism of action is not well understood although it has been proposed that lindane acts as a non-competitive antagonist at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor. We studied the effect of lindane (150 mg/kg) on the GABAergic and dopaminergic systems by measuring the concentration of GABA, dopamine and its metabolites in 7 brain areas at the onset of seizures. All animals suffered tonic convulsions at 18.3 +/- 1.4 min after lindane administration. The concentration of GABA was only slightly but significantly decreased in the colliculi without modifications in the other areas. The concentration of dopamine was increased in the mesencephalon and that of its metabolite DOPAC was also increased in the mesencephalon and the striatum.
Lindane is an organochloride pesticide and scabicide. It evokes convulsions mainly trough the blockage of GABA(A) receptors. Nitric oxide (NO), gaseous neurotransmitter, has contradictor role in epileptogenesis due to opposite effects of L-arginine, precursor of NO syntheses (NOS), and L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) observed in different epilepsy models. The aim of the current study was to determine the effects of NO on the behavioral and EEG characteristics of lindane-induced epilepsy in male Wistar albino rats. The administration of L-arginine (600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg, i.p.) in dose-dependent manner significantly increased convulsion incidence and severity and shortened latency time to first convulsion elicited by lower lindane dose (4 mg/kg, i.p.). On the contrary, pretreatment with L-NAME (500, 700 and 900 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased convulsion incidence and severity and prolonged latency time to convulsion following injection with a convulsive dose of lindane (8 mg/kg, i.p.). EEG analyses showed increase of number and duration of ictal periods in EEG of rats receiving l-arginine prior to lindane and decrease of this number in rats pretreated with L-NAME. These results support the conclusion that NO plays a role of endogenous convulsant in rat model of lindane seizures.

Linkage disequilibrium mapping in isolated founder populations: diastrophic dysplasia in Finland.
Linkage disequilibrium mapping in isolated populations provides a powerful tool for fine structure localization of disease genes. Here, Luria and Delbrucks classical methods for analysing bacterial cultures are adapted to the study of human isolated founder populations in order to estimate (i) the recombination fraction between a disease locus and a marker; (ii) the expected degree of allelic homogeneity in a population; and (iii) the mutation rate of marker loci. Using these methods, we report striking linkage disequilibrium for diastrophic dysplasia (DTD) in Finland indicating that the DTD gene should lie within 0. 06 centimorgans (or about 60 kilobases) of the CSF1R gene. Predictions about allelic homogeneity in Finland and mutation rates in simple sequence repeats are confirmed by independent observations.

Linkage studies using restriction fragment length polymorphisms were conducted in the X-linked disorder, choroideremia, designated TCD for Progressive Tapeto-Choroidal Dystrophy. Previously demonstrated close linkage with locus DXYS1 was confirmed (lod 11. 44 at 0 recombination distance). In addition, locus DXYS12 was found to be closely linked with TCD (lod 3. 31 at 0 recombination distance). The disease mainly occurs in three large kindreds in remote Northern Finland. While formal genealogical proof is lacking, all presently living (more than 80 affected males and 120 carrier females) probably originate from a common founder couple born in 1644 and 1646, twelve generations ago. All 36 patients and 48 carriers tested from the three kindreds had the same haplotype (TCD/DXYS1, 11kb/DXYS12, 1. 6kb). Given that at least 105 female meioses transmitting TCD have occurred since 1650 in these kindreds, extremely close linkage between TCD, DXYS1 and DXYS12 is suggested. The above haplotype is a very useful diagnostic tool in these TCD families. We suggest that our historical-genealogical approach to linkage analysis may be possible elsewhere in similar isolated populations
Lipid metabolism was studied in cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with the inherited disorder, Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS). Intact SLS fibroblasts incubated in the presence of [1-14C] palmitate accumulated more radioactive hexadecanol than did normal cells, whereas incorporation of radioactivity into other cellular lipids was unaltered. The hexadecanol content of SLS fibroblasts was abnormally elevated. Hexadecanol accumulation was not due to increased fatty alcohol synthesis nor its deficient utilization for glycerol ether synthesis. The half-life of intracellular hexadecanol loaded into SLS fibroblasts was increased (70 min) compared with normal (15 min), and intact SLS fibroblasts showed impaired oxidation of [14C] -hexadecanol to fatty acid. Fatty alcohol NAD + oxidoreductase, the enzyme catalyzing this reaction, was deficient in SLS fibroblasts. Mean total activity in SLS fibroblasts (n = 5) was 13% of that in normal fibroblasts, and palmitoyl CoA-inhibitable activity was 1% of normal. Fibroblasts from two obligate SLS heterozygotes had enzyme activities intermediate between that in normal fibroblasts and individuals with SLS. These results suggest that the primary defect in SLS is deficiency of fatty alcohol NAD + oxidoreductase. SLS represents the first inherited disorder in man associated with an isolated abnormality in fatty alcohol metabolism..
Lipocalins are carrier proteins for hydrophobic molecules in many biological fluids. In the oral sphere (nasal mucus, saliva, tears), they have an environmental biosensor function and are involved in the detection of odours and pheromones. Herein, we report the first identification of human lipocalins involved in odorant binding. They correspond to a gene family located on human chromosome 9q34 produced by genomic duplications: two new odorant-binding protein genes ( hOBP (IIa) and hOBP (IIb) ), the previously described tear lipocalin LCN1 gene and two new LCN1 pseudogenes. Although 95% similar in sequence, the two hOBP (II) genes were differentially expressed in secretory structures. hOBP (IIa) was strongly expressed in the nasal structures, salivary and lachrymal glands, and lung, therefore having an oral sphere profile. hOBP (IIb) was more strongly expressed in genital sphere organs such as the prostate and mammary glands. Both were expressed in the male deferent ducts and placenta. Surprisingly, alternatively spliced mRNAs resulting in proteins with different C-termini were generated from each of the two genes. The single LCN1 gene in humans generated a putative odorant-binding protein in nasal structures. Finally, based on the proposed successive genomic duplication history, we demonstrated the recruitment of exons within intronic DNA generating diversity. This is consistent with a positive selection pressure in vertebrate evolution in the intron-late hypothesis.
Liposomal daunorubicin in advanced Kaposi's sarcoma: a phase II study.
Lithium and valproate are the prototypic mood stabilizers and have diverse structures and targets. Both drugs influence inositol metabolism. Lithium inhibits IMPase and valproate inhibits MIP synthase. This study shows that MIP synthase inhibition does not replicate or augment the effects of lithium in the inositol sensitive pilocarpine-induced seizures model. This lack of effects may stem from the low contribution of de-novo synthesis to cellular inositol supply or to the inhibition of the de-novo synthesis by lithium itself.
Lithium, an effective antipsychotic, induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) in 40% of patients. The decreased capacity to concentrate urine is likely due to lithium acutely disrupting the cAMP pathway and chronically reducing urea transporter (UT-A1) and water channel (AQP2) expression in the inner medulla. Targeting an alternative signaling pathway, such as PKC-mediated signaling, may be an effective method of treating lithium-induced polyuria. PKC-alpha null mice (PKCa KO) and strain-matched wild type (WT) controls were treated with lithium for 0, 3 or 5 days. WT mice had increased urine output and lowered urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment whereas PKCa KO mice had no change in urine output or concentration. Western blot analysis revealed that AQP2 expression in medullary tissues was lowered after 3 and 5 days in WT mice; however, AQP2 was unchanged in PKCa KO. Similar results were observed with UT-A1 expression. Animals were also treated with lithium for 6 weeks. Lithium-treated WT mice had 19-fold increased urine output whereas treated PKCa KO animals had a 4-fold increase in output. AQP2 and UT-A1 expression was lowered in 6 week lithium-treated WT animals whereas in treated PKCa KO mice, AQP2 was only reduced by 2-fold and UT-A1 expression was unaffected. Urinary sodium, potassium and calcium were elevated in lithium-fed WT but not in lithium-fed PKCa KO mice. Our data show that ablation of PKCa preserves AQP2 and UT-A1 protein expression and localization in lithium-induced NDI, and prevents the development of the severe polyuria associated with lithium therapy.
Lithium-associated cognitive and functional deficits reduced by a switch to divalproex sodium: a case series.
Little information is presently available concerning mitochondrial respiratory and oxidative phosphorylation function in the normal human heart during growth and development. We investigated the levels of specific mitochondrial enzyme activities and content during cardiac growth and development from the early neonatal period (10-20 days) to adulthood (67 years). Biochemical analysis of enzyme specific activities and content and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was performed with left ventricular tissues derived from 30 control individuals. The levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and complex V specific activity, mtDNA copy number and COX subunit II content remained unchanged in contrast to increased citrate synthase (CS) activity and content. The developmental increase in CS activity paralleled increasing CS polypeptide content, but was neither related to overall increases in mitochondrial number nor coordinately regulated with mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities. Our findings of unchanged levels of cardiac mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity during the progression from early childhood to older adult contrasts with the age-specific regulation found with CS, a Krebs cycle mitochondrial enzyme.
Liver disease caused by propylthiouracil.
Liver enlargement and muscle wastage occurred in Wistar rats following the subcutaneous administration of prednisolone. In the liver both the content of RNA and the biosynthesis of ribosomal RNA increased while both the RNA content and ribosomal RNA biosynthesis were reduced in the gastrocnemius muscle. It is suggested that the drug acted in a selective and tissue-specific manner to enhance ribosomal RNA synthesis in the liver and depress such synthesis in the muscle. This view supports the contention that the liver and muscle are independent sites of prednisolone action.
Liver transplantation for acutely ill patients with fulminant liver failure carries high intraoperative and immediate postoperative risks. These are increased with the presence of concomitant acute kidney injury (AKI) and intraoperative dialysis is sometimes required to allow the transplant to proceed. The derangements in the procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways during fulminant liver failure can lead to difficulties with anticoagulation during dialysis, especially when continued in the operating room. Systemic anticoagulation is unsafe and regional citrate anticoagulation in the absence of a functional liver carries the risk of citrate toxicity. Citrate dialysate, a new dialysate with citric acid can be used for anticoagulation in patients who cannot tolerate heparin or regional citrate. We report a case of a 40-year-old female with acetaminophen-induced fulminant liver failure with associated AKI who underwent intraoperative dialytic support during liver transplantation anticoagulated with citrate dialysate during the entire procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any signs of citrate toxicity and maintained adequate anticoagulation for patency of the dialysis circuit. Citrate dialysate is a safe alternative for intradialytic support of liver transplantation in fulminant liver failure.
Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.

Local anesthetics that are commonly used in ophthalmic surgery (0.75% bupivacaine hydrochloride, 2.0% mepivacaine hydrochloride, and 2.0% lidocaine hydrochloride plus 1:100,000 epinephrine) were injected into the retrobulbar area of rat eyes. Controls were injected with physiological saline. All three anesthetics produced massive degeneration of the extraocular muscles. Muscle degeneration is followed by regeneration of the damaged muscle fibers. In addition to muscle damage, severe damage was also seen in harderian glands, especially after exposure to mepivacaine and lidocaine plus epinephrine. With these findings in rats, it is hypothesized that the temporary diplopia sometimes seen in patients after ophthalmic surgery might be due to anesthetic-induced damage to the extraocular muscles.

Localized scleroderma has no recognized internal organ involvement but may be disfiguring and disabling when the cutaneous lesions are extensive or affect children. There is no accepted or proven treatment for localized scleroderma. Case reports of 11 patients with severe, extensive localized scleroderma who were treated with D-penicillamine are summarized in this article. This drug was judged to have a favorable effect on the disease course in 7 (64%) of 11 patients. Improvement began within 3 to 6 months and consisted of cessation of active cutaneous lesions in all 7 patients, skin softening in 5, and more normal growth of the affected limb in 2 of 3 children. Joint stiffness and contractures also improved. The dose of D-penicillamine associated with a favorable response was as low as 2 to 5 mg/kg per day given over a period ranging from 15 to 53 months. D-Penicillamine caused nephrotic syndrome in 1 patient and milder reversible proteinuria in 3 other patients; none developed renal insufficiency. These data suggest that D-penicillamine may be effective in severe cases of localized scleroderma.
Locus heterogeneity in Friedreich ataxia.
Locus-specific databases (LSDBs) are curated collections of sequence variants in genes associated with disease. LSDBs of cancer-related genes often serve as a critical resource to researchers, diagnostic laboratories, clinicians, and others in the cancer genetics community. LSDBs are poised to play an important role in disseminating clinical classification of variants. The IARC Working Group on Unclassified Genetic Variants has proposed a new system of five classes of variants in cancer susceptibility genes. However, standards are lacking for reporting and analyzing the multiple data types that assist in classifying variants. By adhering to standards of transparency and consistency in the curation and annotation of data, LSDBs can be critical for organizing our understanding of how genetic variation relates to disease. In this article we discuss how LSDBs can accomplish these goals, using existing databases for BRCA1, BRCA2, MSH2, MLH1, TP53, and CDKN2A to illustrate the progress and remaining challenges in this field. We recommend that: 1) LSDBs should only report a conclusion related to pathogenicity if a consensus has been reached by an expert panel. 2) The system used to classify variants should be standardized. The Working Group encourages use of the five class system described in this issue by Plon and colleagues. 3) Evidence that supports a conclusion should be reported in the database, including sources and criteria used for assignment. 4) Variants should only be classified as pathogenic if more than one type of evidence has been considered. 5) All instances of all variants should be recorded.
Locus-specific databases and recommendations to strengthen their contribution to the classification of variants in cancer susceptibility genes.
Lometrexol is an antifolate which inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), an enzyme essential for de novo purine synthesis. Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that lometrexol has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs, notably methotrexate. However, the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities. Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose. This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of lometrexol given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of lometrexol can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation. Thrombocytopenia and mucositis were the major toxicities. There was no clear relationship between clinical toxicity and the extent of plasma folate elevation. Associated studies demonstrated that lometrexol plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by folic acid administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce toxicity by enhancing lometrexol plasma clearance. The work described in this report has identified for the first time a clinically acceptable schedule for the administration of a GARFT inhibitor. This information will facilitate the future evaluation of this class of compounds in cancer therapy.

Long-term administration of quinidine was associated with persistent elevation of serum concentrations of SGOT, lactic acid dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase. Liver biopsy showed active hepatitis. Discontinuance of quinidine therapy led to normalization of liver function tests. A challenge dose of quinidine caused clinical symptoms and abrupt elevation of SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, and lactic acid dehydrogenase values. We concluded that this patient had quinidine hepatotoxicity and believe that this is the first case reported with liver biopsy documentation. This report also suggests that, even after long-term administration, the hepatic toxicity is reversible.

The first ultrastructural changes in structural elements of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in the cerebellar cortex were detectable after 3 months of the experiment. They became more severe in the later months of the experiment, and were most severe after 12 months, located mainly in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. Lesions of the capillary included necrosis of endothelial cells. Organelles of these cells, in particular the mitochondria (increased number and size, distinct degeneration of their matrix and cristae) and Golgi apparatus were altered. Reduced size of capillary lumen and occlusion were caused by swollen endothelial cells which had luminal protrusions and swollen microvilli. Pressure on the vessel wall was produced by enlarged perivascular astrocytic processes. Fragments of necrotic endothelial cells were in the vascular lumens and in these there was loosening and breaking of tight cellular junctions. Damage to the vascular basement lamina was also observed. Damage to the capillary was accompanied by marked damage to neuroglial cells, mainly to perivascular processes of astrocytes. The proliferation of astrocytes (Bergmann's in particular) and occasionally of oligodendrocytes was found. Alterations in the structural elements of the BBB coexisted with marked lesions of neurons of the cerebellum (Purkinje cells are earliest). In electron micrographs both luminal and antiluminal sides of the BBB of the cerebellar cortex had similar lesions. The possible influence of the hepatic damage, mainly hyperammonemia, upon the development of valproate encephalopathy is discussed.

Lorazepam is being used with increasing frequency as a sedative in the newborn and the young infant. Concern has been raised with regard to the safety of lorazepam in this age group, especially in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW; < 1,500 g) infants. Three young infants, all of birth weight < 1,500 g, experienced myoclonus following the intravenous administration of lorazepam. The potential neurotoxic effects of the drug (and its vehicle) in this population are discussed. Injectable lorazepam should be used with caution in VLBW infants.
Loreclezole (5 mg/kg) exerted a significant protective action in amygdala-kindled rats, reducing both seizure and afterdischarge durations. The combinations of loreclezole (2.5 mg/kg) with valproate, clonazepam, or carbamazepine (applied at their subprotective doses) also exhibited antiseizure effect in this test. However, only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature. Among several chemoconvulsants, bicuculline, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and BAY k-8644 (the opener of L-type calcium channels) reversed the protective activity of loreclezole alone and its combination with valproate. On the other hand, bicuculline, aminophylline and BAY k-8644 inhibited the anticonvulsive action of loreclezole combined with clonazepam. The results support the hypothesis that the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with other antiepileptics may involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission and blockade of L-type of calcium channels.

Loss of endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide (NO) in hypertension is a hallmark of arterial dysfunction. Experimental hypertension created by the removal of NO, however, involves mechanisms in addition to decreased arterial vasodilator activity. These include augmented endothelin-1 (ET-1) release, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and elevated tissue oxidative stress. We hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle (venomotor) tone plays a role in Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA) hypertension through these mechanisms. Rats were treated with the NO synthase inhibitor LNNA (0.5 g/L in drinking water) for 2 weeks. Mean arterial pressure of conscious rats was 119 +/- 2 mm Hg in control and 194 +/- 5 mm Hg in LNNA rats (P<0.05). Carotid arteries and vena cava were removed for measurement of isometric contraction. Maximal contraction to norepinephrine was modestly reduced in arteries from LNNA compared with control rats whereas the maximum contraction to ET-1 was significantly reduced (54% control). Maximum contraction of vena cava to norepinephrine (37% control) also was reduced but no change in response to ET-1 was observed. Mean circulatory filling pressure, an in vivo measure of venomotor tone, was not elevated in LNNA hypertension at 1 or 2 weeks after LNNA. The superoxide scavenger tempol (30, 100, and 300 micromol kg(-1), IV) did not change arterial pressure in control rats but caused a dose-dependent decrease in LNNA rats (-18 +/- 8, -26 +/- 15, and -54 +/- 11 mm Hg). Similarly, ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium caused a significantly greater fall in LNNA hypertensive rats (76 +/- 9 mm Hg) compared with control rats (35 +/- 10 mm Hg). Carotid arteries, vena cava, and sympathetic ganglia from LNNA rats had higher basal levels of superoxide compared with those from control rats. These data suggest that while NO deficiency increases oxidative stress and sympathetic activity in both arterial and venous vessels, the impact on veins does not make a major contribution to this form of hypertension.

Loss of heterozygosity data from familial tumors suggest that BRCA1, a gene that confers susceptibility to ovarian and early-onset breast cancer, encodes a tumor suppressor. The BRCA1 region is also subject to allelic loss in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers, an indication that BRCA1 mutations may occur somatically in these tumors. The BRCA1 coding region was examined for mutations in primary breast and ovarian tumors that show allele loss at the BRCA1 locus. Mutations were detected in 3 of 32 breast and 1 of 12 ovarian carcinomas; all four mutations were germline alterations and occurred in early-onset cancers. These results suggest that mutation of BRCA1 may not be critical in the development of the majority of breast and ovarian cancers that arise in the absence of a mutant germline allele..

Lovastatin and simvastatin are the 2 best-known members of the class of hypolipidaemic agents known as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Clinical experience with lovastatin includes over 5000 patients, 700 of whom have been treated for 2 years or more, and experience with simvastatin includes over 3500 patients, of whom 350 have been treated for 18 months or more. Lovastatin has been marketed in the United States for over 6 months. Both agents show substantial clinical efficacy, with reductions in total cholesterol of over 30% and in LDL-cholesterol of 40% in clinical studies. Modest increases in HDL-cholesterol levels of about 10% are also reported. Clinical tolerability of both agents has been good, with fewer than 3% of patients withdrawn from treatment because of clinical adverse experiences. Ophthalmological examinations in over 1100 patients treated with one or the other agent have revealed no evidence of significant short term (up to 2 years) cataractogenic potential. One to 2% of patients have elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal. These episodes are asymptomatic and reversible when therapy is discontinued. Minor elevations of creatine kinase levels are reported in about 5% of patients. Myopathy, associated in some cases with myoglobinuria, and in 2 cases with transient renal failure, has been rarely reported with lovastatin, especially in patients concomitantly treated with cyclosporin, gemfibrozil or niacin. Lovastatin and simvastatin are both effective and well-tolerated agents for lowering elevated levels of serum cholesterol. As wider use confirms their safety profile, they will gain increasing importance in the therapeutic approach to hypercholesterolaemia and its consequences.

Lowe syndrome, also known as oculocerebrorenal syndrome, is caused by mutations in the X chromosome-encoded OCRL gene. The OCRL protein is 51% identical to inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase II (5-phosphatase II) from human platelets over a span of 744 aa, suggesting that OCRL may be a similar enzyme. We engineered a construct of the OCRL cDNA that encodes amino acids homologous to the platelet 5-phosphatase for expression in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells. This cDNA encodes aa 264-968 of the OCRL protein. The recombinant protein was found to catalyze the reactions also carried out by platelet 5-phosphatase II. Thus OCRL converts inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate to inositol 1, 4-bisphosphate, and it converts inositol 1, 3, 4, 5-tetrakisphosphate to inositol 1, 3, 4-trisphosphate. Most important, the enzyme converts phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. The relative ability of OCRL to catalyze the three reactions is different from that of 5-phosphatase II and from that of another 5-phosphatase isoenzyme from platelets, 5-phosphatase I. The recombinant OCRL protein hydrolyzes the phospholipid substrate 10- to 30-fold better than 5-phosphatase II, and 5-phosphatase I does not cleave the lipid at all. We also show that OCRL functions as a phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase in OCRL-expressing Sf9 cells. These results suggest that OCRL is mainly a lipid phosphatase that may control cellular levels of a critical metabolite, phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate. Deficiency of this enzyme apparently causes the protean manifestations of Lowe syndrome..
Luteal phase serum cell-free DNA as a marker of failed pregnancy after assisted reproductive technology.
Ly9 is a mouse cell membrane antigen found on all lymphocytes and coded for by a gene that maps to chromosome 1. We previously described the isolation and characterization of a full-length cDNA clone for mouse Ly9. Using cross-species hybridization we isolated cDNA clones encoding the human homologue Humly9. Analysis of the predicted protein sequence suggests that the extra-cellular portion of the Humly9 molecules is composed of four Ig-like domains: a V domain (V) without disulphide bonds and a truncated C2 domain (tC2) with two disulphide bonds, a second V domain without disulphide bonds and a second tC2 with two disulphide bonds, i.e., as V-tC2-V-tC2. The gene encoding Humly9 was mapped to chromosome 1 by analysis of human/hamster hybrids, and more specifically to the 1q22 region by in situ hybridization. The protein sequence data support the view that Humly9 belongs to the immunoglobulin-superfamily subgroup which includes CD48, CD2, and LFA-3.
Lysophospholipases are critical enzymes that act on biological membranes to regulate the multifunctional lysophospholipids; increased levels of lysophospholipids are associated with a host of diseases. Herein we report the cDNA cloning of a human brain 25 kDa lysophospholipid-specific lysophospholipase (hLysoPLA). The enzyme (at both mRNA and protein levels) is widely distributed in tissues, but with quite different abundances. The hLysoPLA hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine in both monomeric and micellar forms, and exhibits apparent cooperativity and surface dilution kinetics, but not interfacial activation. Detailed kinetic analysis indicates that the hLysoPLA binds first to the micellar surface and then to the substrate presented on the surface. The kinetic parameters associated with this surface dilution kinetic model are reported, and it is concluded that hLysoPLA has a single substrate binding site and a surface recognition site. The apparent cooperativity observed is likely due to the change of substrate presentation. In contrast to many non-specific lipolytic enzymes that exhibit lysophospholipase activity, hLysoPLA hydrolyzes only lysophospholipids and has no other significant enzymatic activity. Of special interest, hLysoPLA does not act on plasmenylcholine. Of the several inhibitors tested, only methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) potently and irreversibly inhibits the enzymatic activity. The inhibition by MAFP is consistent with the catalytic mechanism proposed for the enzyme - a serine hydrolase with a catalytic triad composed of Ser-119, Asp-174 and His-208.

MK-801 augments pilocarpine-induced electrographic seizure but protects against brain damage in rats.
MK-801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, was tested for anticonvulsant effects in rats using two seizure models, coadministration of lithium and pilocarpine and administration of a high dose of pilocarpine alone. Three major results are reported. First, pretreatment with MK-801 produced an effective and dose-dependent anticonvulsant action with the lithium-pilocarpine model but not with rats treated with pilocarpine alone, suggesting that different biochemical mechanisms control seizures in these two models. Second, the anticonvulsant effect of MK-801 in the lithium-pilocarpine model only occurred after initial periods of seizure activity. This observation is suggested to be an in vivo demonstration of the conclusion derived from in vitro experiments that MK-801 binding requires agonist-induced opening of the channel sites of the NMDA receptor. Third, although it is relatively easy to block seizures induced by lithium and pilocarpine by administration of anticonvulsants prior to pilocarpine, it is more difficult to terminate ongoing status epilepticus and block the lethality of the seizures. Administration of MK-801 30 or 60 min after pilocarpine, i.e., during status epilepticus, gradually reduced electrical and behavioral seizure activity and greatly enhanced the survival rate. These results suggest that activation of NMDA receptors plays an important role in status epilepticus and brain damage in the lithium-pilocarpine model. This was further supported by results showing that nonconvulsive doses of NMDA and pilocarpine were synergistic, resulting in status epilepticus and subsequent mortality.

Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) belongs to a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia. The disease-causing mutation has recently been identified as an unstable and expanded (CAG) n trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene of unknown function. In Caucasians, repeat expansions in the MJD1 gene have also been found in patients with the clinically distinct autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). In order to gain insight into the biology of the MJD1/SCA3 gene we cloned the rat homologue and studied its expression. The rat and human ataxin-3 genes are highly homologous with an overall sequence identity of approximately 88%. However, the C-terminal end of the putative protein differs strongly from the published human sequence. The (CAG) n block in the rat cDNA consists of just three interrupted units suggesting that a long polyglutamine stretch is not essential for the normal function of the ataxin-3 protein in rodents. The expression pattern of the SCA3 gene in various rat and human tissues was investigated by Northern blot analyses. The mature transcript is approximately 6 kb in length. In rat testis, a smaller transcript of 1. 3 kb was identified. Transcription of rsca3 was detected in most rat tissues including brain. Analyzing the expression level of the SCA3 gene in several human brain sections revealed no significant higher mRNA level in regions predominantly affected in MJD. Thus additional molecules and/or regulatory events are necessary to explain the exclusive degeneration of certain brain areas.
Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine tract near the C-terminus of the MJD1 gene product, ataxin-3. The mutant ataxin-3 forms intranuclear inclusions in cultured cells as well as in diseased human brain and also causes cell death in transfected cells. However, the normal function of ataxin-3 remains unknown. To explore the function of ataxin-3, we used the two-hybrid system to screen for the protein(s) that interacts with ataxin-3. We found that ataxin-3 interacts with two human homologs of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23, HHR23A and HHR23B. Furthermore, we confirmed that ataxin-3 interacts with the -ubiquitin-like domain at the N-terminus of the HHR23 proteins, which is important for nucleotide excision repair; however, ataxin-3 does not interact with -ubiquitin, implying that ataxin-3 might be functionally associated with the HHR23 proteins through this specific interaction. The normal and mutant ataxin-3 proteins show no difference in their ability to bind to the HHR23 proteins. However, in 293 cells HHR23A is recruited to intranuclear inclusions formed by the mutant ataxin-3 through its interaction with ataxin-3. These results suggest that this interaction is associated with the normal function of ataxin-3 and that some functional abnormality of the HHR23 proteins might exist in MJD.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with D-penicillamine (D-pen) 500 mg/kg/day for 10 or 42 days. Pair fed rats served as controls. Changes in aortic morphology were examined by light- and transmission-electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after i. v. injection of human serum 131I-albumin (131I-HSA). TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of D-pen-treated rats, consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation. In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall, together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells. The aorta/serum-ratio and the radioactive build-up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I-HSA was reduced in animals treated with D-pen for 42 days, indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate. The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by D-pen, and no differences in aortic 131I-HSA radioactivity or aorta/serum-ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection, indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by D-pen treatment. These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of D-pen may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta, possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross-linking of collagen and elastin.
Male rats received the noradrenaline neurotoxin DSP4 (50 mg/kg) 7 days prior to injection of D-amphetamine (10 or 40 mumol/kg i.p.). The hyperactivity induced by D-amphetamine (10 mumol/kg) was significantly reduced by DSP4 pretreatment. However, the increased rearings and the amphetamine-induced stereotypies were not blocked by pretreatment with DSP4. The reduction of amphetamine hyperactivity induced by DSP4 was blocked by pretreatment with the noradrenaline-uptake blocking agent, desipramine, which prevents the neurotoxic action of DSP4. The present results suggest a selective involvement of central noradrenergic neurones in the locomotor stimulant effect of amphetamine in the rat.
Malignant neoplasms in the families of patients with ataxia-telangiectasia.
Mammalian quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRTase) (EC 2.4.2.19) is a key enzyme in catabolism of quinolinate, an intermediate in the tryptophan-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) pathway. Quinolinate acts as a most potent endogenous exitotoxin to neurons. Elevation of quinolinate levels in the brain has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. As the first step to elucidate molecular basis underlying the quinolinate metabolism, the cDNA encoding human brain QPRTase was cloned and characterized. Utilizing partial amino acid sequences obtained from highly purified porcine kidney QPRTase, a human isolog was obtained from a human brain cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a open reading frame of 297 amino acids, and shares 30 to 40% identity with those of bacterial QPRTases. To confirm that the cDNA clone encodes human QPRTase, its functional expression was studied in a bacterial host. Introduction of the human cDNA into a QPRTase defective (nadC) E. coli strain brought about an abrupt increase in QPRTase activity and allowed the cells to grow in the absence of nicotinic acid. It is concluded that the cloned cDNA encodes human QPRTase which is functional beyond the phylogenic boundary.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive type of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy, and their prognosis is poor. However, a 38% remission rate has been recently reported in refractory MCL treated with temsirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor.Here we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory MCL who had tumor regression two months after temsirolimus treatment, and a progression-free survival of 10 months. In this case, lymph node biopsies were performed before and six months after temsirolimus therapy. Comparison of the two biopsies showed that temsirolimus inhibited tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic tumor cells. Apart from this cytostatic effect, temsirolimus had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of tumor microvessel density and of VEGF expression. Moreover, numerous patchy, well-limited fibrotic areas, compatible with post-necrotic tissue repair, were found after 6-month temsirolimus therapy. Thus, temsirolimus reduced tumor burden through associated cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects.This dual effect of temsirolimus on tumor tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficiency in refractory MCL resistant to conventional chemotherapy.
Many authors described the effects on the fetus of maternal cocaine abuse during pregnancy. Vasoconstriction appears to be the common mechanism of action leading to a wide range of fetal anomalies. We report on an infant with multiple cranial-nerve involvement attributable to brainstem dysgenesis, born to a cocaine-addicted mother.
Many efficacious cancer treatments cause significant cardiac morbidity, yet biomarkers or functional indices of early damage, which would allow monitoring and intervention, are lacking. In this study, we have utilized a rat model of progressive doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, applying multiple approaches, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to provide the most comprehensive characterization to date of the timecourse of serological, pathological, and functional events underlying this toxicity. Hannover Wistar rats were dosed with 1.25 mg/kg DOX weekly for 8 weeks followed by a 4 week off-dosing "recovery" period. Electron microscopy of the myocardium revealed subcellular degeneration and marked mitochondrial changes after a single dose. Histopathological analysis revealed progressive cardiomyocyte degeneration, hypertrophy/cytomegaly, and extensive vacuolation after two doses. Extensive replacement fibrosis (quantified by Sirius red staining) developed during the off-dosing period. Functional indices assessed by cardiac MRI (including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output, and E/A ratio) declined progressively, reaching statistical significance after two doses and culminating in "clinical" LV dysfunction by 12 weeks. Significant increases in peak myocardial contrast enhancement and serological cardiac troponin I (cTnI) emerged after eight doses, importantly preceding the LVEF decline to <50%. Troponin I levels positively correlated with delayed and peak gadolinium contrast enhancement, histopathological grading, and diastolic dysfunction. In summary, subcellular cardiomyocyte degeneration was the earliest marker, followed by progressive functional decline and histopathological manifestations. Myocardial contrast enhancement and elevations in cTnI occurred later. However, all indices predated "clinical" LV dysfunction and thus warrant further evaluation as predictive biomarkers.
Many human tumours have length alterations in repetitive sequence elements. Although this microsatellite instability has been attributed to mutations in four DNA mismatch repair genes in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) kindreds, many sporadic tumours exhibit instability but no detectable mutations in these genes. It is therefore of interest to identify other genes that contribute to this instability. In yeast, mutations in several genes, including RTH and MSH3, cause microsatellite instability. Thus, we screened 16 endometrial carcinomas with microsatellite instability for alterations in FEN1 (the human homolog of RTH) and in MSH3 (refs 12-14). Although we found no FEN1 mutations, a frameshift mutation in MSH3 was observed in an endometrial carcinoma and in an endometrial carcinoma cell line. Extracts of the cell line were deficient in repair of DNA substrates containing mismatches or extra nucleotides. Introducing chromosome 5, encoding the MSH3 gene, into the mutant cell line increased the stability of some but not all microsatellites. Extracts of these cells repaired certain substrates containing extra nucleotides, but were deficient in repair of those containing mismatches or other extra nucleotides. A subsequent search revealed a second gene mutation in HHUA cells, a missense mutation in the MSH6 gene. Together the data suggest that the MSH3 gene encodes a product that functions in repair of some but not all pre-mutational intermediates, its mutation in tumours can result in genomic instability and, as in yeast, MSH3 and MSH6 are partially redundant for mismatch repair..
Many mutations leading to human disease are the result of single DNA base pair changes that cannot be identified by Southern analysis. This has prompted the development of alternative assays for point mutation detection. The recently described ribonuclease A cleavage procedure, with a polyuridylic acid-paper affinity chromatography step, has been used to identify the mutational lesions in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) messenger RNAs of patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Distinctive ribonuclease A cleavage patterns were identified in messenger RNA from 5 of 14 Lesch-Nyhan patients who were chosen because no HPRT Southern or Northern blotting pattern changes had been found. This approach now allows HPRT mutation detection in 50 percent of the cases of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The polyuridylic acid-paper affinity procedure provides a general method for analysis of low abundance messenger RNAs..
Many new serotonergic antidepressants have been introduced over the past decade. Although urinary incontinence is listed as one side effect of these drugs in their package inserts there is only one report in the literature. This concerns 2 male patients who experienced incontinence while taking venlafaxine. In the present paper the authors describe 2 female patients who developed incontinence secondary to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paroxetine and sertraline, as well as a third who developed this side effect on venlafaxine. In 2 of the 3 cases the patients were also taking lithium carbonate and beta-blockers, both of which could have contributed to the incontinence. Animal studies suggest that incontinence secondary to serotonergic antidepressants could be mediated by the 5HT4 receptors found on the bladder. Further research is needed to delineate the frequency of this troubling side effect and how best to treat it.
Many nuclear components participating in related pathways appear concentrated in specific areas of the mammalian nucleus. The importance of this organization is attested to by the dysfunction that correlates with mis-localization of nuclear proteins in human disease and cancer. Determining the sub-nuclear localization of proteins is therefore important for understanding genome regulation and function, and it also provides clues to function for novel proteins. However, the complexity of proteins in the mammalian nucleus is too large to tackle this on a protein by protein basis. Large-scale approaches to determining protein function and sub-cellular localization are required. We have used a visual gene trap screen to identify more than 100 proteins, many of which are normal, located within compartments of the mouse nucleus. The most common discrete localizations detected are at the nucleolus and the splicing speckles and on chromosomes. Proteins at the nuclear periphery, or in other nuclear foci, have also been identified. Several of the proteins have been implicated in human disease or cancer, e.g. ATRX, HMGI-C, NBS1 and EWS, and the gene-trapped proteins provide a route into further understanding their function. We find that sequence motifs are often shared amongst proteins co-localized within the same sub-nuclear compartment. Conversely, some generally abundant motifs are lacking from the proteins concentrated in specific areas of the nucleus. This suggests that we may be able to predict sub-nuclear localization for proteins in databases based on their sequence.
Many systemic antimicrobials have been implicated to cause ocular adverse effects. This is especially relevant in multidrug therapy where more than one drug can cause a similar ocular adverse effect. We describe a case of progressive loss of vision associated with linezolid therapy. A 45-year-old male patient who was on treatment with multiple second-line anti-tuberculous drugs including linezolid and ethambutol for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) presented to us with painless progressive loss of vision in both eyes. Color vision was defective and fundus examination revealed optic disc edema in both eyes. Ethambutol-induced toxic optic neuropathy was suspected and tablet ethambutol was withdrawn. Deterioration of vision occurred despite withdrawal of ethambutol. Discontinuation of linezolid resulted in marked improvement of vision. Our report emphasizes the need for monitoring of visual function in patients on long-term linezolid treatment.

Mapping of homozygous deletions on human chromosome 10q23 has led to the isolation of a candidate tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, that appears to be mutated at considerable frequency in human cancers. In preliminary screens, mutations of PTEN were detected in 31% (13/42) of glioblastoma cell lines and xenografts, 100% (4/4) of prostate cancer cell lines, 6% (4/65) of breast cancer cell lines and xenografts, and 17% (3/18) of primary glioblastomas. The predicted PTEN product has a protein tyrosine phosphatase domain and extensive homology to tensin, a protein that interacts with actin filaments at focal adhesions. These homologies suggest that PTEN may suppress tumor cell growth by antagonizing protein tyrosine kinases and may regulate tumor cell invasion and metastasis through interactions at focal adhesions..

Marked deficiency of muscle adhalin, a 50 kDa sarcolemmal dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, has been reported in severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (SCARMD). This is a Duchenne-like disease affecting both males and females first described in Tunisian families. Adhalin deficiency has been found in SCARMD patients from North Africa Europe, Brazil, Japan and North America (SLR & KPC, unpublished data). The disease was initially linked to an unidentified gene on chromosome 13 in families from North Africa, and to the adhalin gene itself on chromosome 17q in one French family in which missense mutations were identified. Thus there are two kinds of myopathies with adhalin deficiency: one with a primary defect of adhalin (primary adhalinopathies), and one in which absence of adhalin is secondary to a separate gene defect on chromosome 13. We have examined the importance of primary adhalinopathies among myopathies with adhalin deficiency, and describe several additional mutations (null and missense) in the adhalin gene in 10 new families from Europe and North Africa. Disease severity varies in age of onset and rate of progression, and patients with null mutations are the most severely affected.

Masseter muscle rigidity during general anesthesia is considered an early warning sign of a possible episode of malignant hyperthermia. The decision whether to continue or discontinue the procedure depends on the urgency of the surgery and severity of masseter muscle rigidity. Here, we describe a case of severe masseter muscle rigidity (jaw of steel) after succinylcholine (Sch) administration during general anesthetic management for rigid bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body. Anesthesia was continued uneventfully with propofol infusion while all facilities were available to detect and treat malignant hyperthermia.
Massive cerebral edema associated with fulminant hepatic failure in acetaminophen overdose: possible role of cranial decompression.
Massive proteinuria and acute renal failure after oral bisphosphonate (alendronate) administration in a patient with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
Massive urinary protein excretion has been observed after conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to mammalian target of rapamycin (mToR) inhibitors, especially sirolimus, in renal transplant recipients with chronic allograft nephropathy. Because proteinuria is a major predictive factor of poor transplantation outcome, many studies focused on this adverse event during the past years. Whether proteinuria was due to sirolimus or only a consequence of calcineurin inhibitors withdrawal remained unsolved until high range proteinuria has been observed during sirolimus therapy in islet transplantation and in patients who received sirolimus de novo. Podocyte injury and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis have been related to mToR inhibition in some patients, but the pathways underlying these lesions remain hypothetic. We discuss herein the possible mechanisms and the significance of mToR blockade-induced proteinuria.

Maternal lithium and neonatal Ebstein's anomaly: evaluation with cross-sectional echocardiography.
Maternal smoking is a recognized risk factor for orofacial clefts. Maternal or fetal pharmacogenetic variants are plausible modulators of this risk. In this work, we studied 5,427 DNA samples, including 1,244 from subjects in Denmark and Iowa with facial clefting and 4,183 from parents, siblings, or unrelated population controls. We examined 25 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 16 genes in pathways for detoxification of components of cigarette smoke, to look for evidence of gene-environment interactions. For genes identified as related to oral clefting, we studied gene-expression profiles in fetal development in the relevant tissues and time intervals. Maternal smoking was a significant risk factor for clefting and showed dosage effects, in both the Danish and Iowan data. Suggestive effects of variants in the fetal NAT2 and CYP1A1 genes were observed in both the Iowan and the Danish participants. In an expanded case set, NAT2 continued to show significant overtransmission of an allele to the fetus, with a final P value of .00003. There was an interaction between maternal smoking and fetal inheritance of a GSTT1-null deletion, seen in both the Danish (P=.03) and Iowan (P=.002) studies, with a Fisher's combined P value of <.001, which remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Gene-expression analysis demonstrated expression of GSTT1 in human embryonic craniofacial tissues during the relevant developmental interval. This study benefited from two large samples, involving independent populations, that provided substantial power and a framework for future studies that could identify a susceptible population for preventive health care.
Maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) for chromosome 15 is responsible for an estimated 30% of cases of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We report on an unusual case of maternal disomy 15 in PWS that is most consistent with adjacent-1 segregation of a paternal t (3; 15) (p25; q11. 2) with simultaneous maternal meiotic nondisjunction for chromosome 15. The patient (J. B.), a 17-year-old white male with PWS, was found to have 47 chromosomes with a supernumerary, paternal der (15) consisting of the short arm and the proximal long arm of chromosome 15, and distal chromosome arm 3p. The t (3; 15) was present in the balanced state in the patients father and a sister. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the PWS critical region resided on the derivative chromosome 3 and that there was no deletion of the PWS region on the normal pair of 15s present in J. B. Methylation analysis at exon alpha of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated polypeptide N (SNRPN) gene showed a pattern characteristic of only the maternal chromosome 15 in J. B. Maternal disomy was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of microsatellite repeats at the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor beta3 subunit (GABRB3) locus. A niece (B. B.) with 45 chromosomes and the derivative 3 but without the der (15) demonstrated a phenotype consistent with that reported for haploinsufficiency of distal 3 p. Uniparental disomy associated with unbalanced segregation of non-Robertsonian translocations has been reported previously but has not, to our knowledge, been observed in a case of PWS. Furthermore, our findings are best interpreted as true gamete complementation resulting in maternal UPD 15 and PWS

Mature male and female mice from six inbred stains were tested for susceptibility to behavioral seizures induced by a single injection of cocaine. Cocaine was injected ip over a range of doses (50-100 mg/kg) and behavior was monitored for 20 minutes. Seizure end points included latency to forelimb or hindlimb clonus, latency to clonic running seizure and latency to jumping bouncing seizure. A range of strain specific sensitivities was documented with A/J and SJL mice being most sensitive and C57BL/6J most resistant. DBA/2J, BALB/cByJ and NZW/LacJ strains exhibited intermediate sensitivity. EEG recordings were made in SJL, A/J and C57BL/6J mice revealing a close correspondence between electrical activity and behavior. Additionally, levels of cocaine determined in hippocampus and cortex were not different between sensitive and resistant strains. Additional studies of these murine strains may be useful for investigating genetic influences on cocaine-induced seizures.
McArdle disease: the mutation spectrum of PYGM in a large Italian cohort.
McLeod syndrome is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by abnormalities in the neuromuscular and hematopoietic systems. We have assembled a cosmid contig of 360 kb that encompasses the McLeod gene locus. A 50 kb deletion was detected by screening DNA from patients with radiolabeled whole cosmids, and two transcription units were identified within this deletion. The mRNA expression pattern of one of them, designated as XK, correlates closely to the McLeod phenotype. XK encodes a novel protein with structural characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane transport proteins. Nucleotide sequence analysis of XK from two unrelated McLeod patients has identified point mutations at conserved splice donor and acceptor sites. These findings provide direct evidence that XK is responsible for McLeod syndrome..
Mdm2 has been shown to regulate p53 stability by targeting the p53 protein for proteasomal degradation. We now report that Mdm2 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) for p53 and that its activity is dependent on its RING finger. Furthermore, we show that Mdm2 mediates its own ubiquitination in a RING finger-dependent manner, which requires no eukaryotic proteins other than ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). It is apparent, therefore, that Mdm2 manifests an intrinsic capacity to mediate ubiquitination. Mutation of putative zinc coordination residues abrogated this activity, as did chelation of divalent cations. After cation chelation, the full activity could be restored by addition of zinc. We further demonstrate that the degradation of p53 and Mdm2 in cells requires additional potential zinc-coordinating residues beyond those required for the intrinsic activity of Mdm2 in vitro. Replacement of the Mdm2 RING with that of another protein (Praja1) reconstituted ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Mdm2. However, this RING was ineffective in ubiquitination and proteasomal targeting of p53, suggesting that there may be specificity at the level of the RING in the recognition of heterologous substrates.
Mdm2 is a RING finger-dependent ubiquitin protein ligase for itself and p53.

Mechanisms triggering the commitment of pluripotent bone marrow stem cells to differentiated lineages such as mononuclear macrophages or multinucleated megakaryocytes are still unknown, although several lines of evidence suggested correlation between cholinergic signaling and hematopoietic differentiation. We now present cloning of a cDNA coding for CHED (cholinesterase-related cell division controller), a human homolog of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell division cycle 2 (cdc2)-like kinases, universal controllers of the mitotic cell cycle. Library screening, RNA blot hybridization, and direct PCR amplification of cDNA reverse-transcribed from cellular mRNA revealed that CHED mRNA is expressed in multiple tissues, including bone marrow. The CHED protein includes the consensus ATP binding and phosphorylation domains characteristic of kinases, displays 34-42% identically aligned amino acid residues with other cdc2-related kinases, and is considerably longer at its amino and carboxyl termini. An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide designed to interrupt CHED's expression (AS-CHED) significantly reduced the ratio between CHED mRNA and actin mRNA within 1 hr of its addition to cultures, a reduction that persisted for 4 days. AS-CHED treatment selectively inhibited megakaryocyte development in murine bone marrow cultures but did not prevent other hematopoietic pathways, as evidenced by increasing numbers of mononuclear cells. An oligodeoxynucleotide blocking production of the acetylcholine-hydrolyzing enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase, displayed a similar inhibition of megakaryocytopoiesis. In contrast, an oligodeoxynucleotide blocking production of the human 2Hs cdc2 homolog interfered with production of the human 2Hs cdc2 homolog interfered with cellular proliferation without altering the cell-type composition of these cultures. Therefore, these findings strengthen the link between cholinergic signaling and cell division control in hematopoiesis and implicate both CHED and cholinesterases in this differentiation process.
Mechano-sensitive and fatty acid-activated K(+) belong to the structural class of K(+) channel with two pore domains. Here, we report the isolation and the characterization of a novel member of this family. This channel, called TREK2, is closely related to TREK1 (78% of homology). Its gene is located on chromosome 14q31. TREK2 is abundantly expressed in pancreas and kidney and to a lower level in brain, testis, colon, and small intestine. In the central nervous system, TREK2 has a widespread distribution with the highest levels of expression in cerebellum, occipital lobe, putamen, and thalamus. In transfected cells, TREK2 produces rapidly activating and non-inactivating outward rectifier K(+) currents. The single-channel conductance is 100 picosiemens at +40 mV in 150 mm K(+). The currents can be strongly stimulated by polyunsaturated fatty acid such as arachidonic, docosahexaenoic, and linoleic acids and by lysophosphatidylcholine. The channel is also activated by acidification of the intracellular medium. TREK2 is blocked by application of intracellular cAMP. As with TREK1, TREK2 is activated by the volatile general anesthetics chloroform, halothane, and isoflurane and by the neuroprotective agent riluzole. TREK2 can be positively or negatively regulated by a variety of neurotransmitter receptors. Stimulation of the G(s)-coupled receptor 5HT4sR or the G(q)-coupled receptor mGluR1 inhibits channel activity, whereas activation of the G(i)-coupled receptor mGluR2 increases TREK2 currents. These multiple types of regulations suggest that TREK2 plays an important role as a target of neurotransmitter action.
Medial changes in arterial spasm induced by L-norepinephrine.
Median convulsant (CD50) and median lethal (LD50) doses of three representative local anesthetics were determined in adult mice to evaluate the threat to life of local anesthetic-induced convulsions. The CD50 and LD50, respectively, were 57.7 and 58.7 mg/kg for bupivacaine, 111.0 and 133.1 mg/kg for lidocaine, and 243.4 and 266.5 mg/kg for chloroprocaine. When given intraperitoneally, bupivacaine thus was only about twice as toxic as lidocaine and four times as toxic as chloroprocaine. Convulsions always preceded death, except after precipitous cardiopulmonary arrest from extreme doses. A CD50 dose of local anesthetic (causing convulsions in 50% of mice) was fatal in 90% of bupivacaine-induced seizures, in 57% of the chloroprocaine group, and in 6% of the lidocaine group. The narrow gap between convulsant and lethal doses of local anesthetics indicates that untreated convulsions present much more of a threat to life than heretofore appreciated.

Meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy (DM) locus has recently been suggested as being responsible for maintaining the frequency, in the human population, of DM chromosomes capable of expansion to the disease state. In order to test this hypothesis, we have studied samples of single sperm from three individuals heterozygous at the DM locus, each with one allele larger and one allele smaller than 19 CTG repeats. To guard against the possible problem of differential PCR amplification rates based on the lengths of the alleles, the sperm were also typed at another closely linked marker whose allele size was unrelated to the allele size at the DM locus. Using statistical models specifically designed to study single-sperm segregation data, we find no evidence of meiotic segregation distortion. The upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimate of the common segregation probability for the three donors is at or below. 515 for all models considered, and no statistically significant difference from. 5 is detected in any of the models. This suggests that any greater amount of segregation distortion at the myotonic dystrophy locus must result from events following sperm ejaculation.
Meiotic segregation analysis of RB1 alleles in retinoblastoma pedigrees by use of single-sperm typing.
Melatonin affects the circadian sleep/wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug-induced narcosis. Sodium thiopenthal was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre-treated with melatonin (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg). Melatonin pre-treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis, however, no dose-effect correlation was found. In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis. In contrast, the highest dose of melatonin (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of narcosis, and a reduction in mortality rate. Melatonin 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine- or diazepam-induced narcosis. Thus, the dual action of melatonin on pharmacological narcosis seems to be specific for the barbiturate mechanism of action.
Meloxicam-induced liver toxicity.
Members of the DEAD/H box-containing helicase superfamily include proteins essential to genome replication, repair, and expression. We report here the cloning and initial characterization of a novel human member of this protein family, designated hHel1 (human helicase 1), now designated SMARCAD1 by HUGO. This DEAD/H box-containing molecule has seven highly conserved sequence regions that allow us to place it in the SNF2 family of the helicase superfamily. Uniquely, though, hHel1 contains two DEAD/H box motifs, a property not reported to be shared by any other SNF2 family members. This defines a new subfamily consisting of hHel1 and its homologues. In addition to these DEAD/H box/ATP-binding motifs, hHel1 has a putative nuclear localization signal and several regions that may mediate protein-protein interactions. Expression analysis indicates that hHel1 transcripts are ubiquitous, with particularly high levels in endocrine tissue. We have mapped the gene for hHel1 to human chromosome 4q22-q23; this region is rich in breakpoints and deletion mutants of genes involved in several human diseases, notably soft tissue leiomyosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hematologic malignancies. Our observation that human Hel1 gene overexpression is present in an E1A-expressing cell line with increased capacity for gene reactivation events by genomic rearrangement suggests that human Hel1 may play a role in genetic instability development.

Members of the ICE/Ced-3 gene family are likely effector components of the cell death machinery. Here, we characterize a novel member of this family designated ICE-LAP6. By phylogenetic analysis, ICE-LAP6 is classified into the Ced-3 subfamily which includes Ced-3, Yama/CPP32/apopain, Mch2, and ICE-LAP3/Mch3/CMH-1. Interestingly, ICE-LAP6 contains an active site QACGG pentapeptide, rather than the QACRG pentapeptide shared by other family members. Overexpression of ICE-LAP6 induces apoptosis in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells. More importantly, ICE-LAP6 is proteolytically processed into an active cysteine protease by granzyme B, an important component of cytotoxic T cell-mediated apoptosis. Once activated, ICE-LAP6 is able to cleave the death substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase into signature apoptotic fragments.

Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes, mGlu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia, but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of PD is not known. The effects of N,N'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine dihydrochloride (AMN082), the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors, were thus tested in different rodent models of PD. Here, we show that oral (5 mg/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of AMN082 reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. AMN082 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) reduces apomorphine-induced rotations in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of PD patients, 5 mg/kg AMN082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. In addition, AMN082 reduces the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in a mGlu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice. Higher doses of AMN082 (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) have no effect on the same models of PD. Overall these findings suggest that mGlu7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced dopamine activity. Selective ligands of mGlu7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies.
Metabotropic glutamate 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of Parkinson's disease.
Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is a neurodegenerative disease in which the lysosomal enzyme, Aryl sulfatase A (ARSA) is deficient. The disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and its frequency is estimated to be 1/40, 000 live births. The gene of ARSA has been cloned and up to now eight mutations causing MLD have been reported. Another mutation, PD, leads to the deficiency of the enzyme in vitro (pseudodeficiency) without any known clinical effect. The PD mutation is frequent in all populations. In Israel, late infantile MLD was found to be very frequent in a small Jewish isolate, the Habbanite Jews (1/75 live births). The molecular analysis demonstrated that in the Habbanite population, the mutation occurred on an allele with the PD mutation. The loss of ARSA activity is due to a point mutation C > T leading to a change of proline to leucine. MLD is also frequent among Moslem Arabs in Jerusalem. The mutation is a transition G > A destroying the splice donor site of exon 2. This mutation has been reported in patients with the late infantile MLD from different ethnic groups. The Christian Arabs in Israel also have a high incidence of the disease (1/10, 000 live births); the mutation in this population is still unknown. Knowledge of the different mutations causing MLD in these defined populations will allow a carrier screening program to be carried out and prevent the birth of additional affected children..
Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA; EC 3. 1. 6. 8). The 8 ARSA exons and adjacent intron boundaries from a patient with late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified in seven discrete reactions. Amplified ARSA exons were analysed for the presence of sequence alterations by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, followed by direct sequencing of PCR products. The patient was found to be homozygous for a C-- > T transition in exon IV that results in the substitution of a highly conserved threonine residue at amino acid 274 with a methionine (T274M). Analysis of a further 29 MLD patients revealed the presence of five additional homozygotes for T274M. All 6 T274M homozygotes (representing four families) were of Lebanese descent, and all were known to be the result of consanguineous marriages. The altered amino acid is rigidly conserved among 10 sulfatases from Escherichia coli to humans; therefore, it is most likely that the resultant mutant protein will have little or no enzyme activity. This is consistent with the very low ARSA activity measured in these patients and their uniformly severe clinical presentation

Methamphetamine (MA)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals. This study examined the effect of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, and deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, on the MA-induced neurotoxicity. Male rats were treated with MA (10 mg/kg, every 2 h for four injections). The rat received either alpha-TC (20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to MA administration or DFO (50 mg/kg) subcutaneously 30 min before MA administration. The concentrations of dopamine (DA), serotonin and their metabolites decreased significantly after MA administration, which was inhibited by the alpha-TC and DFO pretreatment. alpha-TC and DFO attenuated the MA-induced hyperthermia as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity. The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced glutathione concentration was lower in the MA-treated rats. These changes were significantly attenuated by alpha-TC and DFO. This suggests that alpha-TC and DFO ameliorate the MA-induced neuronal damage by decreasing the level of oxidative stress.
Methamphetamine (METH) damages dopamine (DA) nerve endings by a process that has been linked to microglial activation but the signaling pathways that mediate this response have not yet been delineated. Cardona et al. [Nat. Neurosci. 9 (2006), 917] recently identified the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) as an important mediator of MPTP-induced neurodegeneration of DA neurons. Because the CNS damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in METH-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation. Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were treated with METH and examined for striatal neurotoxicity. METH depleted DA, caused microglial activation, and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild-type controls. The effects of METH in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender-dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum. Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after METH that are characteristic of activation. This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP-microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by METH. We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate METH neurotoxicity or microglial activation. Furthermore, it appears that striatal-resident microglia respond to METH with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration.
Methamphetamine (METH) triggers a disruption of the monoaminergic system and METH abuse leads to negative emotional states including depressive symptoms during drug withdrawal. However, it is currently unknown if the acute toxic dosage of METH also causes a long-lasting depressive phenotype and persistent monoaminergic deficits. Thus, we now assessed the depressive-like behaviour in mice at early and long-term periods following a single high METH dose (30 mg/kg, i.p.). METH did not alter the motor function and procedural memory of mice as assessed by swimming speed and escape latency to find the platform in a cued version of the water maze task. However, METH significantly increased the immobility time in the tail suspension test at 3 and 49 days post-administration. This depressive-like profile induced by METH was accompanied by a marked depletion of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, indicated by a reduction in the levels of dopamine, DOPAC and HVA, tyrosine hydroxylase and serotonin, observed at both 3 and 49 days post-administration. In parallel, another neurochemical feature of depression--astroglial dysfunction--was unaffected in the cortex and the striatal levels of the astrocytic protein marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, were only transiently increased at 3 days. These findings demonstrate for the first time that a single high dose of METH induces long-lasting depressive-like behaviour in mice associated with a persistent disruption of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic homoeostasis.
Methamphetamine causes alterations in the MAP kinase-related pathways in the brains of mice that display increased aggressiveness.
Methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation are not mediated by fractalkine receptor signaling.
Methimazole is a widely used and generally well-tolerated antithyroid agent. A 43-year-old woman had severe jaundice and itching 1 month after receiving methimazole (10 mg tid) and propranolol (20 mg tid) for treatment of hyperthyroidism. The patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of jaundice until she finished both medications. When seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later, she still had severe icterus, pruritus, and hyperbilirubinemia, formed mainly of the conjugated fraction. Methimazole-induced cholestasis was diagnosed, and propranolol therapy was resumed. Over the following 9 days, the symptoms improved and plasma bilirubin levels were normal after 12 weeks without methimazole. In rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy, this drug can cause severe and reversible cholestatic jaundice. Physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that, upon occurrence, they can discontinue methimazole therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures.

Methyldopa is an antihypertensive medication which is available generically and under the trade name Aldomet that is widely prescribed in the adult population and infrequently used in children. Methyldopa causes an autoimmune hemolytic anemia in a small percentage of patients who take the drug. We report a case of methyldopa-induced hemolytic anemia in a 15-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with near-syncope. The boy had been treated with intravenous methyldopa during a trauma admission seven weeks prior to presentation. Evaluation revealed a hemoglobin of three grams, 3+ Coombs' test with polyspecific anti-human globulin and monospecific IgG reagents, and a warm reacting autoantibody. Transfusion and corticosteroid therapy resulted in a complete recovery of the patient. Emergency physicians treating children must be aware of this syndrome in order to diagnose and treat it correctly. A brief review of autoimmune and drug-induced hemolytic anemias is provided.
Methyldopa-induced hemolytic anemia in a 15 year old presenting as near-syncope.
Methylphenidate is structurally and functionally similar to amphetamine. Cerebral vasculitis associated with amphetamine abuse is well documented, and in rare cases ischaemic stroke has been reported after methylphenidate intake in children. We report the case of a 63-year-old female who was treated with methylphenidate due to hyperactivity and suffered from multiple ischaemic strokes. We consider drug-induced cerebral vasculitis as the most likely cause of recurrent ischaemic strokes in the absence of any pathological findings during the diagnostic work-up. We conclude that methylphenidate mediated vasculitis should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms and a history of methylphenidate therapy. This potential side-effect, though very rare, represents one more reason to be very restrictive in the use of methylphenidate.

Metronidazole can produce neurological complications although it is not a common scenario. We present a case where a patient developed features of encephalopathy following prolonged metronidazole intake. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed abnormal signal intensity involving both dentate nuclei of cerebellum and splenium of corpus callosum. The diagnosis of metronidazole toxicity was made by the MRI findings and supported clinically.

Mice deficient in Six5 develop cataracts: implications for myotonic dystrophy.
Mice homozygous for the fat mutation develop obesity and hyperglycaemia that can be suppressed by treatment with exogenous insulin. The fat mutation maps to mouse chromosome 8, very close to the gene for carboxypeptidase E (Cpe), which encodes an enzyme (CPE) that processes prohormone intermediates such as proinsulin. We now demonstrate a defect in proinsulin processing associated with the virtual absence of CPE activity in extracts of fat/fat pancreatic islets and pituitaries. A single Ser202Pro mutation distinguishes the mutant Cpe allele, and abolishes enzymatic activity in vitro. Thus, the fat mutation represents the first demonstration of an obesity-diabetes syndrome elicited by a genetic defect in a prohormone processing pathway.

Microfluorimetry and patch-clamp experiments were performed on TRPV6-expressing HEK cells to determine whether this Ca(2+)-sensing Ca(2+) channel is constitutively active. Intact cells loaded with fura-2 had an elevated intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ((i)), which decreased to the same level such as in non-transfected cells if external Ca(2+) was chelated by EGTA. Whole cell recordings from non-transfected HEK cells and cells expressing human TRPV6 revealed the presence of a basal inward current in both types of cells when the internal solution contained 0.1 mm EGTA and 100 nm (i) or if the cytosolic Ca(2+) buffering remained undisturbed in perforated patch-clamp experiments. If recombinantly expressed TRPV6 forms open channels, one would expect Ca(2+)-induced current inhibition, because TRPV6 is negatively regulated by internal Ca(2+). However, dialyzing solutions with high such as 1 microm into TRPV6-expressing cells did not block the basal inward current, which was not different from the recordings from non-transfected cells. In contrast, dialyzing 0.5 mm EGTA into TRPV6-expressing cells readily activated Ca(2+) inward currents, which were undetectable in non-transfected cells. Interestingly, monovalent cations permeated the TRPV6 channels under conditions where no Ca(2+) permeation was detectable, indicating that divalent cations block TRPV6 channels from the extracellular side. Like human TRPV6, the truncated human TRPV6(Delta695-725), which lacks the C-terminal domain required for Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding, does not form constitutive active channels, whereas the human TRPV6(D542A), carrying a point mutation in the presumed pore region, does not function as a channel. In summary, no constitutive open TRPV6 channels were detected in patch-clamp experiments from transfected HEK cells. However, channel activity is highly regulated by intracellular and extracellular divalent cations.
Microglial cells, the resident macrophages of the brain, play an important role in the neuropathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and recent studies suggest that opioid peptides regulate the function of macrophages from somatic tissues. We report herein the presence of kappa opioid receptors (KORs) in human fetal microglia and inhibition of HIV-1 expression in acutely infected microglial cell cultures treated with KOR ligands. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analyses, we found that mRNA for the KOR was constitutively expressed in microglia and determined that the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame was identical to that of the human brain KOR gene. The expression of KOR in microglial cells was confirmed by membrane binding of [3H]U69,593, a kappa-selective ligand, and by indirect immunofluorescence. Treatment of microglial cell cultures with U50,488 or U69,593 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of expression of the monocytotropic HIV-1 SF162 strain. This antiviral effect of the kappa ligands was blocked by the specific KOR antagonist, nor-binaltrophimine. These findings suggest that kappa opioid agonists have immunomodulatory activity in the brain, and that these compounds could have potential in the treatment of HIV-1-associated encephalopathy.

Midazolam compared with thiopentone as an induction agent.
Midazolam hydrochloride is commonly used for dental or endoscopic procedures. Although generally consisted safe when given intramuscularly, intravenous administration is known to cause respiratory and cardiovascular depression. This report describes the first published case of cardiorespiratory arrest and death associated with intramuscular administration of midazolam. Information regarding midazolam use is reviewed to provide recommendation for safe administration.
Midline B3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in hypotensive effect of methyldopa.
Migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase, thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception. In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide (NO) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura. In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura, in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura. The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and/or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced. Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls. Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject. Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008). In the controls, the GTN-induced headache gradually disappeared, whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion. At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society. The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura. Since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate NO in animals, this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine with aura.

Milk-alkali syndrome induced by 1,25(OH)2D in a patient with hypoparathyroidism.
Milk-alkali syndrome was first described 70 years ago in the context of the treatment of peptic ulcer disease with large amounts of calcium and alkali. Although with current ulcer therapy (H-2 blockers, omeprazole, and sucralfate), the frequency of milk-alkali syndrome has decreased significantly, the classic triad of hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal impairment remains the hallmark of the syndrome. Milk-alkali syndrome can present serious and occasionally life-threatening illness unless diagnosed and treated appropriately. This article presents a patient with hypoparathyroidism who was treated with calcium carbonate and calcitriol resulting in two admissions to the hospital for milk-alkali syndrome. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous pamidronate on his first admission and with hydrocortisone on the second. This illustrates intravenous pamidronate as a valuable therapeutic tool when milk-alkali syndrome presents as hypercalcemic emergency.
MinK is a widely expressed protein of relative molecular mass approximately 15K that forms potassium channels by aggregation with other membrane proteins. MinK governs ion channel activation, regulation by second messengers, and the function and structure of the ion conduction pathway. Association of minK with a channel protein known as KvLQT1 produces a voltage-gated outward K+ current (I[sK]) resembling the slow cardiac repolarization current (I[Ks]). HERG, a human homologue of the ether-a-go-go gene of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, encodes a protein that produces the rapidly activating cardiac delayed rectifier (I[Kr]). These two potassium currents, I(Ks) and I(Kr), provide the principal repolarizing currents in cardiac myocytes for the termination of action potentials. Although heterologously expressed HERG channels are largely indistinguishable from native cardiac I(Kr), a role for minK in this current is suggested by the diminished I(Kr) in an atrial tumour line subjected to minK antisense suppression. Here we show that HERG and minK form a stable complex, and that this heteromultimerization regulates I(Kr) activity. MinK, through the formation of heteromeric channel complexes, is thus central to the control of the heart rate and rhythm.

Mirk protein kinase is activated by MKK3 and functions as a transcriptional activator of HNF1alpha.
Mirk/Dyrk1B is an arginine-directed serine/threonine protein kinase that is expressed at low levels in most normal tissues but at elevated levels in many tumor cell lines and in normal skeletal muscle. Colon carcinoma cell lines stably overexpressing Mirk proliferated in serum-free medium, but the mechanism of Mirk action is unknown. DCoHm (dimerization cofactor of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha ( HNF1alpha) from muscle), a novel gene of the DCoH family with 78% amino acid identity to DCoH, was identified as a Mirk-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid analysis and cloned. Mirk co-immunoprecipitated with DCoHm and bound to DCoHm in glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. DCoH stabilizes HNF1alpha as a dimer and enhances its transcriptional activity on the beta-fibrinogen promoter reporter, and DCoHm had similar activity. Mirk enhanced HNF1alpha transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas two kinase-inactive Mirk mutants and a Mirk N-terminal deletion mutant did not. Mirk, DCoHm, and HNF1alpha formed a complex. Mirk bound to a specific region within the CREB-binding protein-binding region of HNF1alpha and phosphorylated HNF1alpha at a site adjacent to the Mirk-binding region. Conversely, the HNF1alpha binding domain was located within the first five conserved kinase subdomains of Mirk. Mirk co-immunoprecipitated with the MAPK kinase MKK3, an upstream activator of p38. MKK3 enhanced Mirk kinase activity and the transcriptional activation of HNF1alpha by Mirk, suggesting that Mirk, like p38, is activated by certain environmental stress agents. The Mirk-binding protein DCoH has been shown to be selectively expressed in colon carcinomas but not in normal tissue. Mirk may function as an HNF1alpha transcriptional activator in response to an MKK3-mediated stress signal, and the selective expression of DCoH could restrict the Mirk response to carcinoma cells.
Misoprostol (200 micrograms) has been shown to acutely counteract the indomethacin-induced renal dysfunction in well compensated cirrhotic patients. The aim of this study was to determine if the prophylactic value of misoprostol was dose-dependent. Parameters of renal hemodynamics and tubular sodium and water handling were assessed by clearance techniques in 26 well compensated cirrhotic patients before and after an oral combination of 50 mg of indomethacin and various doses of misoprostol. The 200-micrograms dose was able to totally abolish the deleterious renal effects of indomethacin, whereas the 800-micrograms dose resulted in significant worsening of renal hemodynamics and sodium retention. These changes were maximal in the hour immediately after medications and slowly returned toward base-line levels thereafter. These results suggest that the renal protective effects of misoprostol is dose-dependent. However, until this apparent ability of 200 micrograms of misoprostol to prevent the adverse effects of indomethacin on renal function is confirmed with chronic frequent dosing, it would be prudent to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with cirrhosis.
Misoprostol has been associated with adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal symptoms, gynecologic problems, and headache. Changes in mental status, however, have not been reported. We present a case in which an 89-year-old woman in a long-term care facility became confused after the initiation of misoprostol therapy. The patient's change in mental status was first reported nine days after the initiation of therapy. Her delirium significantly improved after misoprostol was discontinued and her mental status returned to normal within a week. Because no other factors related to this patient changed significantly, the delirium experienced by this patient possibly resulted from misoprostol therapy.

Mitochondrial DNA and its respiratory chain products are defective in doxorubicin nephrosis.
Mitochondrial abnormalities have been associated with several aspects of epileptogenesis, such as energy generation, control of cell death, neurotransmitter synthesis, and free radical (FR) production. Increased production of FRs may cause mtDNA damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits. In this study, we investigated whether increased generation of FR during status epilepticus would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), complex IV of the respiratory chain, in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. DNA analysis revealed low amounts of a 4.8 kb mtDNA deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups. We did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mtDNA-encoded subunit of CCO (CCO-I) or a relative decrease in CCO-I when compared with nuclear-encoded subunits (CCO-IV and SDH-fp). No abnormality in CCO activity was observed through histochemistry. Although evidences of mitochondrial abnormalities were found in previously published studies, our results do not suggest that the FRs, generated during the acute phase, determined important abnormalities in mtDNA, in expression of CCO-I, and in CCO activity.
Mitochondrial impairment contributes to cocaine-induced cardiac dysfunction: Prevention by the targeted antioxidant MitoQ.
Mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD) was purified from human liver. The molecular masses of the native enzyme and the subunit were estimated to be 154 and 70 kD, respectively. The enzyme was found to catalyze the major part of mitochondrial palmitoylcoenzyme A dehydrogenation in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and skin fibroblasts (89-97, 86-99, 96-99, and 78-87%, respectively). Skin fibroblasts from 26 patients suspected of having a disorder of mitochondrial beta-oxidation were analyzed for VLCAD protein using immunoblotting, and 7 of them contained undetectable or trace levels of the enzyme. The seven deficient fibroblast lines were characterized by measuring acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenation activities, overall palmitic acid oxidation, and VLCAD protein synthesis using pulse-chase, further confirming the diagnosis of VLCAD deficiency. These results suggested the heterogenous nature of the mutations causing the deficiency in the seven patients. Clinically, all patients with VLCAD deficiency exhibited cardiac disease. At least four of them presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This frequency (> 57%) was much higher than that observed in patients with other disorders of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation that may be accompanied by cardiac disease in infants..
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important regulators of a vast number of biological functions that affect life and death of eukaryotic cells and are tightly regulated by the concerted action of several phosphatases. Among these is the human homologue of vaccinia virus H1 phosphatase gene clone 5 (hVH-5) product, which dephosphorylates and thus inhibits members of the MAPK family. Here, we analyzed hVH-5 transcripts in mammary carcinoma cell lines and discovered a sequence with 88% similarity to hVH-5 transcripts. Because this variant of hVH-5 lacked intronic sequences in its genomic structure, we suggest it might be a processed pseudogene of hVH-5. psihVH-5 transcripts were detected in human peripheral tissues as well as in 11 of 14 breast cancer cell lines. In respect to the normal hVH-5 gene, the pseudogene contains several point mutations and a frame shift due to the deletion of 2 bases that would lead to the truncation of the putative psihVH-5 product.
Mitomycin C associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised. It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with mitomycin C treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent. The renal failure usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of mitomycin C treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from renal failure or pulmonary edema. Renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic HUS and include arteriolar fibrin thrombi, expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls, ischemic wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis. The mechanism of action is postulated as mitomycin C-induced endothelial cell damage. We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr-old man with gastric adenocarcinoma who developed renal failure and thrombocytopenia while on treatment with mitomycin C and died in pulmonary edema.

Molecular analysis of a female Lesch-Nyhan patient.
Molecular analysis of an unusual patient with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome has suggested that the mutation is due to a partial HPRT gene duplication. We now report the cloning and sequencing of the mutant HPRT cDNA which shows the precise duplication of exons 2 and 3. This mutation is the result of an internal duplication of 16-20 kilobases of the gene. The structure of the mutant gene suggests that the duplication was not generated by a single unequal crossing-over event between two normal HPRT alleles. Growth of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from this patient in selective medium has permitted isolation of spontaneous HPRT + revertants of this mutation. The reversion event involves a second major HPRT gene rearrangement where most or all of the duplicated portion of the mutant gene is deleted. The original mutation therefore has the potential for spontaneous somatic reversion. This may explain the relatively mild symptoms of the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome exhibited by this patient..

Molecular cloning of cDNA for a new regulatory subunit, designated p97, of the human 26S proteasome showed that the polypeptide consists of 908 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 100184 Da and an isoelectric point of 4.94. Computer analysis showed that p97 is very similar to type-1 tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-receptor-associated protein (TRAP)-2 and 55.11, both of which were identified recently as binding proteins of the cytoplasmic domain of type-1 TNF receptor by yeast two-hybrid screening. This finding suggests that the 26S proteasome might serve as a mediator molecule in the TNF signaling pathway in cells. Computer-assisted similarity analysis also revealed the high sequence similarity of p97 with a yeast protein whose function is yet unknown, the gene for which is here termed NAS1 (non-ATPase subunit 1). Disruption of NAS1 resulted in several phenotypes, including lethality and temperature-sensitive growth, depending on the genetic background of the cells used. The human p97 cDNA suppressed the growth defect of nas1 disruptant cells, when expressed from single-copy or multi-copy vectors, indicating that p97 is functionally equivalent to yeast Nas1p. Culturing of the temperature-sensitive nas1 cells at the restrictive temperature promoted the accumulation polyubiquitinated cellular proteins, implying that the 26S proteasome requires a functional Nas1p subunit for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. These results indicate that p97/Nas1p plays an important regulatory role in the function of the 26S proteasome.

Molecular study and neuropsychological analysis were performed concurrently on 49 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in order to find a molecular explanation for the cognitive impairment observed in most DMD patients. Complete analysis of the dystrophin gene was performed to define the localization of deletions and duplications in relation to the different DMD promoters. Qualitative analysis of the Dp71 transcript and testing for the specific first exon of Dp140 were also carried out. Neuropsychological analysis assessed verbal and visuospatial intelligence, verbal memory, and reading skills. Comparison of molecular and psychometric findings demonstrated that deletions and duplications that were localized in the distal part of the gene seemed to be preferentially associated with cognitive impairment. Two altered Dp71 transcripts and two deleted Dp140 DNA sequences were found in four patients with severe cerebral dysfunction. These findings suggest that some sequences located in the distal part of the gene and, in particular, some DMD isoforms expressed in the brain may be related to the cognitive impairment associated with DMD..
Molecular, functional, and genomic characterization of human KCC2, the neuronal K-Cl cotransporter.
Molecular, kinetic, and functional studies were carried out on erythrocytes and leukocytes in a Spanish male with G6PD deficiency, congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA), and increased susceptibility to infections. G6PD activity was absent in patients red cells and was about 2% of normal in leukocytes. Molecular studies using standard methods (WHO, 1967) showed G6PD in the patient to have a slightly fast electrophoretic mobility at pH 8. 0 with otherwise normal properties (heat stability at 46 degrees C, apparent affinity for substrates, optimum pH, and utilization of substrate analogues). Other tests showed the patients granulocytes to engulf latex particles normally, but to have impaired reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium and ferricytochrome-c as well as reduced iodination. Chemotaxis and random migration of the patients granulocytes were normal as were myeloperoxidase, leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP), and ultrastructural features. The molecular characteristics of G6PD in the patient differed from those of all previously reported variants associated with CNSHA, so the present variant was provisionally called G6PD Barcelona to distinguish it from other G6PD variants previously described. Possible mechanisms for the severe deficiency of G6PD in erythrocytes and granulocytes was investigated by studies on the immunologic specific activity of the mutant enzyme.
Monoclonal antibodies which recognize different epitopes on either titin or nebulin show normal staining patterns on frozen sections of three muscle biopsies of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting performed on two of these muscle biopsies show the normal pattern of titin and nebulin polypeptides. Since the donor of one of these biopsies has a large deletion of the 5-region of the DMD gene, our results argue against the recent proposal that nebulin is the gene mutated in DMD..
Monosodium glutamate (MSG) administration to neonatal rodents produces convulsions and results in numerous biochemical and behavioral deficits. These studies were undertaken to determine if neonatal administration of MSG produced permanent alterations in seizure susceptibility, since previous investigations were inconclusive. A flurothyl ether seizure screening technique was used to evaluate seizure susceptibility in adult mice that received neonatal injections of MSG (4 mg/g and 1 mg/g). MSG treatment resulted in significant reductions in whole brain weight but did not alter seizure threshold. A naloxone (5 mg/kg) challenge was also ineffective in altering the seizure thresholds of either control of MSG-treated mice. Flurothyl ether produced hypothermia which was correlated with the duration of flurothyl exposure; however, the relationship of hypothermia to seizure induction was unclear. Flurothyl seizure testing proved to be a rapid and reliable technique with which to evaluate seizure susceptibility.
Monosomy of distal 1p36 represents the most common terminal deletion in humans and results in one of the most frequently diagnosed mental retardation syndromes. This deletion is considered a contiguous gene deletion syndrome, and has been shown to vary in deletion sizes that contribute to the spectrum of phenotypic anomalies seen in patients with monosomy 1p36. We report on an 8-year-old female with characteristics of the monosomy 1p36 syndrome who demonstrated a novel der(1)t(1;18)(p36.3;q23). Initial G-banded karyotype analysis revealed a deleted chromosome 1, with a breakpoint within 1p36.3. Subsequent FISH and array-based comparative genomic hybridization not only confirmed and partially characterized the deletion of chromosome 1p36.3, but also uncovered distal trisomy for 18q23. In this patient, the duplicated 18q23 is translocated onto the deleted 1p36.3 region, suggesting telomere capture. Molecular characterization of this novel der(1)t(1;18)(p36.3;q23), guided by our clinical array-comparative genomic hybridization, demonstrated a 3.2 Mb terminal deletion of chromosome 1p36.3 and a 200 kb duplication of 18q23 onto the deleted 1p36.3, presumably stabilizing the deleted chromosome 1. DNA sequence analysis around the breakpoints demonstrated no homology, and therefore this telomere capture of distal 18q is apparently the result of a non-homologous recombination. Partial trisomy for 18q23 has not been previously reported. The importance of mapping the breakpoints of all balanced and unbalanced translocations found in the clinical laboratory, when phenotypic abnormalities are found, is discussed.
More than 100 different heterozygous mutations in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been found in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Uniquely, D90A-SOD1 has been identified in recessive, dominant and apparently sporadic pedigrees. The phenotype of homozygotes is stereotyped with an extended survival, whereas that of affected heterozygotes varies. The frequency of D90A-SOD1 is 50 times higher in Scandinavia (2.5%) than elsewhere, though ALS prevalence is not raised there. Our earlier study indicated separate founders for recessive and dominant/sporadic ALS and we proposed a disease-modifying factor linked to the recessive mutation. Here we have doubled our sample set and employed novel markers to characterise the mutation's origin and localise any modifying factor. Linkage disequilibrium analysis indicates that D90A homozygotes and heterozygotes share a rare haplotype and are all descended from a single ancient founder (alpha 0.974) c.895 generations ago. Homozygotes arose subsequently only c.63 generations ago (alpha 0.878). Recombination has reduced the region shared by recessive kindreds to 97-265 kb around SOD1, excluding all neighbouring genes. We propose that a cis-acting regulatory polymorphism has arisen close to D90A-SOD1 in the recessive founder, which decreases ALS susceptibility in heterozygotes and slows disease progression.
More than 50% of Lobund-Wistar (L-W) strain rats developed large, palpable prostate adenocarcinomas (PAs) following treatments with N-nitroso-N-methylurea (CAS: 684-93-5) and testosterone propionate [(TP) CAS: 57-85-2], and most of the tumor-bearing rats manifested metastatic lesions. The incubation periods averaged 10.6 months. Within the same timeframe, no L-W rat developed a similar palpable PA when treated only with TP. In L-W rats, TP acted as a tumor enhancement agent, with primary emphasis on the development of prostate cancer.
More than 75% of the reported mutations in the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene, BRCA1, result in truncated proteins. We have used the protein truncation test (PTT) to screen for mutations in exon 11, which encodes 61% of BRCA1. In 45 patients from breast and/or ovarian cancer families we found six novel mutations two single nucleotide insertions, three small deletions (1-5 bp) and a nonsense mutation identified two unrelated families. Furthermore, we were able to amplify the remaining coding region by RT-PCR using lymphocyte RNA. Combined with PTT, we detected aberrantly spliced products affecting exons 5 and 6 in one of two BRCA1-linked families examined. The protein truncation test promises to become a valuable technique in detecting BRCA1 mutations..

Most Ca2+-permeable ion channels are inhibited by increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration (i), thus preventing potentially deleterious rises in i. In this study, we demonstrate that currents through the osmo-, heat- and phorbol ester-sensitive, Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel TRPV4 are potentiated by intracellular Ca2+. Spontaneous TRPV4 currents and currents stimulated by hypotonic solutions or phorbol esters were reduced strongly at all potentials in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The other permeant divalent cations Ba2+ and Sr2+ were less effective than Ca2+ in supporting channel activity. An intracellular site of Ca2+ action was supported by the parallel decrease in spontaneous currents and i on removal of extracellular Ca2+ and the ability of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores to restore TRPV4 activity in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. During TRPV4 activation by hypotonic solutions or phorbol esters, Ca2+ entry through the channel increased the rate and extent of channel activation. Currents were also potentiated by ionomycin in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Ca2+-dependent potentiation of TRPV4 was often followed by inhibition. By mutagenesis, we localized the structural determinant of Ca2+-dependent potentiation to an intracellular, C-terminal calmodulin binding domain. This domain binds calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. TRPV4 mutants that did not bind calmodulin lacked Ca2+-dependent potentiation. We conclude that TRPV4 activity is tightly controlled by intracellular Ca2+. Ca2+ entry increases both the rate and extent of channel activation by a calmodulin-dependent mechanism. Excessive increases in i via TRPV4 are prevented by a Ca2+-dependent negative feedback mechanism.
Most chromosomal trisomies lead to miscarriages. In all trisomies, trisomy 1 is the most rare case. We herein present a patient who demonstrated a gestational sac and a yolk sac on transvaginal ultrasound. However, at 53 days of gestation, the pregnancy was lost with a diagnosis of a blighted ovum. A D_C was recommended and performed. A cytogenetic analysis from chorionic villi demonstrated a 47,XX,+1 chromosome complement in all 100 cells. Regarding full trisomy 1, there has only been one case report of a preembryo and two case reports in a clinically recognized pregnancy to date.
Most fragile X syndrome patients have expansion of a (CGG) (n) sequence with > 200 repeats (full mutation) in the FMR1 gene responsible for this condition. Hypermethylation of the expanded repeat and of the FMR1 promoter is almost always present and apparently suppresses transcription, resulting in absence of the FMR1 protein. We recently showed that transcriptional reactivation of FMR1 full mutations can be achieved by inducing DNA demethylation with 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-azadC). The level of histone acetylation is another important factor in regulating gene expression; therefore, we treated lymphoblastoid cell lines of non-mosaic full mutation patients with three drugs capable of inducing histone hyperacetylation. We observed a consistent, although modest, reactivation of the FMR1 gene with 4-phenylbutyrate, sodium butyrate and trichostatin A, as shown by RT-PCR. However, we report that combining these drugs with 5-azadC results in a 2- to 5-fold increase in FMR1 mRNA levels obtained with 5-azadC alone, thus showing a marked synergistic effect of histone hyperacetylation and DNA demethylation in the reactivation of FMR1 full mutations..
Most multiple case families of young onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer are thought to be due to highly penetrant mutations in the predisposing genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. However, these mutations are uncommon in the population and they probably account for only a few percent of all breast cancer incidence. A much larger fraction of breast cancer might, in principle, be due to common variants which confer more modest individual risks. There are several common polymorphisms in the BRCA1 gene which generate amino acid substitutions. We have examined the frequency of four of these polymorphisms Gln356Arg, Pro871Leu, Glu1038Gly and Ser1613Gly in large series of breast and ovarian cancer cases and matched controls. Due to strong linkage disequilibrium, these four sites generate only three haplotypes with a frequency > 1. 3%. The most common haplotypes, defined by the alleles Gln356Pro871Glu1038Ser1613 and Gln356Leu871Gly1038Gly1613, have frequencies of 0. 57 and 0. 32 respectively, and these frequencies do not differ significantly between patient and control groups. Thus the most common polymorphisms of the BRCA1 gene do not make a significant contribution to breast or ovarian cancer risk. However, our data suggest that the Arg356 allele may have a different genotype distribution in breast cancer patients from that in controls (Arg356 homozygotes are more frequent in the control groups, P = 0. 01), indicating that it may be protective against breast cancer. If this finding can be confirmed, it may provide an insight into the structural features of the BRCA1 protein that are important for its function.
Motor impairment, dopamine (DA) neuronal activity and proenkephalin (PENK) gene expression in the caudate-putamen (CPu) were measured in 6-OHDA-lesioned and treated (L-DOPA+benserazide) CB1 KO and WT mice. A lesion induced by 6-OHDA produced more severe motor deterioration in CB1 KO mice accompanied by more loss of DA neurons and increased PENK gene expression in the CPu. Oxidative/nitrosative and neuroinflammatory parameters were estimated in the CPu and cingulate cortex (Cg). CB1 KO mice exhibited higher MDA levels and iNOS protein expression in the CPu and Cg compared to WT mice. Treatment with L-DOPA+benserazide (12 weeks) resulted in less severe dyskinesias in CB1 KO than in WT mice. The results revealed that the lack of cannabinoid CB1 receptors increased the severity of motor impairment and DA lesion, and reduced L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. These results suggest that activation of CB1 receptors offers neuroprotection against dopaminergic lesion and the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias.
Motor incoordination, immune deficiencies, and an increased risk of cancer are the characteristic features of the hereditary disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), which is caused by mutations in the ATM gene. Through gene targeting, we have generated a line of Atm mutant mice, Atm (y/y) mice. In contrast to other Atm mutant mice, Atm (y/y) mice show a lower incidence of thymic lymphoma and survive beyond a few months of age. Atm (y/y) mice exhibit deficits in motor learning indicative of cerebellar dysfunction. Even though we found no gross cerebellar degeneration in older Atm (y/y) animals, ectopic and abnormally differentiated Purkinje cells were apparent in mutant mice of all ages. These findings establish that some neuropathological abnormalities seen in A-T patients also are present in Atm mutant mice. In addition, we report a previously unrecognized effect of Atm deficiency on development or maintenance of CD4 (+) 8 (+) thymocytes. We discuss these findings in the context of the hypothesis that abnormal development of Purkinje cells and lymphocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of A-T..
Mouse strain-dependent effect of amantadine on motility and brain biogenic amines.
Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS). We found two separate deletions of nearly 8. 0 and 6. 0 kb in the GALNS gene, including some exons. There are Alu repetitive elements near the breakpoints of the 8. 0-kb deletion, and this deletion resulted from an Alu-Alu recombination. The other 6. 0-kb deletion involved illegitimate recombinational events between incomplete short direct repeats of 8 bp at deletion breakpoints. The same rearrangement has been observed in a heteroallelic state in four unrelated patients. This is the first documentation of a common double deletion a gene that is not a member of a gene cluster.
Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a genetic defect in N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS). In previous studies, we have found two common mutations in Caucasians and Japanese, respectively. To characterize the mutational spectrum in various ethnic groups, mutations in the GALNS gene in Colombian MPS IVA patients were investigated, and genetic backgrounds were extensively analyzed to identify racial origin, based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages. Three novel missense mutations never identified previously in other populations and found in 16 out of 19 Colombian MPS IVA unrelated alleles account for 84. 2% of the alleles in this study. The G301C and S162F mutations account for 68. 4% and 10. 5% of mutations, respectively, whereas the remaining F69V is limited to a single allele. The skewed prevalence of G301C in only Colombian patients and haplotype analysis by restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the GALNS gene suggest that G301C originated from a common ancestor. Investigation of the genetic background by means of mtDNA lineages indicate that all our patients are probably of native American descent
Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a genetic defect in N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS). Previous studies of patients from a British-Irish population showed that the I113F mutation is the most common single mutation among MPS IVA patients and produces a severe clinical phenotype. We studied mutations in the GALNS gene from 23 additional MPS IVA patients (15 from Australia, 8 from Northern Ireland), with various clinical phenotypes (severe, 16 cases; intermediate, 4 cases; mild, 3 cases). We found two common mutations that together accounted for 32% of the 44 unrelated alleles in these patients. One is the T312S mutation, a novel mutation found exclusively in milder patients. The other is the previously described I113F that produces a severe phenotype. The I113F and T312S mutations accounted for 8 (18%) and 6 (14%) of 44 unrelated alleles, respectively. The relatively high residual GALNS activity seen when the T312S mutant cDNA is overexpressed in mutant cells provides an explanation for the mild phenotype in patients with this mutation. The distribution and relative frequencies of the I113F and T312S mutations in Australia corresponded to those observed in Northern Ireland and are unique to these two populations, suggesting that both mutations were probably introduced to Australia by Irish migrants during the 19th century. Haplotype analysis using 6 RFLPs provides additional data that the I113F mutation originated from a common ancestor. The other 9 novel mutations identified in these 23 patients were each limited to a single family. These data provide further evidence for extensive allelic heterogeneity in MPS IVA in British-Irish patients and provide evidence for their transmission to Australia by British-Irish migrants..
Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA; OMIM # 253000), a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of N -acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS), has variable clinical phenotypes. To date we have identified 65 missense mutations in the GALNS gene from MPS IVA patients, but the correlation between genotype and phenotype has remained unclear. We studied 17 missense mutations using biochemical approaches and 32 missense mutations, using structural analyses. Fifteen missense mutations and two newly engineered active site mutations (C79S, C79T) were characterized by transient expression analysis. Mutant proteins, except for C79S and C79T, were destabilized and detected as insoluble precursor forms while the C79S and C79T mutants were of a soluble mature size. Mutants found in the severe phenotype had no activity. Mutants found in the mild phenotype had a considerable residual activity (1. 3-13. 3% of wild-type GALNS activity). Sulfatases, including GALNS, are members of a highly conserved gene family sharing an extensive sequence homology. Thus, a tertiary structural model of human GALNS was constructed from the X-ray crystal structure of N -acetylgalacto-samine-4-sulfatase and arylsulfatase A, using homology modeling, and 32 missense mutations were investigated. Consequently, we propose that there are at least three different reasons for the severe phenotype (i) destruction of the hydrophobic core or modification of the packing; (ii) removal of a salt bridge to destabilize the entire conformation; (iii) modification of the active site. In contrast, mild mutations were mostly located on the surface of the GALNS protein. These studies shed further light on the genotype-phenotype correlation of MPS IVA and structure-function relationship in the sulfatase family.

Multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high-risk stage of choriocarcinoma. Based on this principle a 27-year old woman, classified as being in the high-risk group (Goldstein and Berkowitz score: 11), was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs. The multiple drug schema consisted of: Etoposide 16.213, Methotrexate, Cyclophosphamide, Actomycin-D, and Cisplatin. On the first day of the schedule, moderate high doses of Methotrexate, Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide were administered. Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs, probably originating from the uterus. Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins, which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli. In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations, such as spontaneous necrosis, must be considered less likely. Patients with large pelvic tumor loads are, according to existing classifications, at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance. Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment, especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug. Close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta-hCG values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Multiple origins for phenylketonuria in Europe.
Multiple pterygium syndromes (MPS) comprise a group of multiple congenital anomaly disorders characterized by webbing (pterygia) of the neck, elbows, and/or knees and joint contractures (arthrogryposis). MPS are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous but are traditionally divided into prenatally lethal and nonlethal (Escobar) types. Previously, we and others reported that recessive mutations in the embryonal acetylcholine receptor g subunit (CHRNG) can cause both lethal and nonlethal MPS, thus demonstrating that pterygia resulted from fetal akinesia. We hypothesized that mutations in acetylcholine receptor-related genes might also result in a MPS/fetal akinesia phenotype and so we analyzed 15 cases of lethal MPS/fetal akinesia without CHRNG mutations for mutations in the CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND, and rapsyn (RAPSN) genes. No CHRNA1, CHRNB1, or CHRND mutations were detected, but a homozygous RAPSN frameshift mutation, c.1177-1178delAA, was identified in a family with three children affected with lethal fetal akinesia sequence. Previously, RAPSN mutations have been reported in congenital myasthenia. Functional studies were consistent with the hypothesis that whereas incomplete loss of rapsyn function may cause congenital myasthenia, more severe loss of function can result in a lethal fetal akinesia phenotype.
Multiple side effects of penicillamine therapy in one patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
Multipoint linkage analysis of choroideremia (TCD) and seven X chromosomal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) was carried out in 18 Finnish TCD families. The data place TCD distal to PGK and DXS72, very close to DXYS1 and DXYS5 (Zmax = 24 at theta = 0) and proximal to DXYS4 and DXYS12. This agrees with the data obtained from other linkage studies and from physical mapping. All the TCD males and carrier females studied have the same DXYS1 allele in coupling with TCD. In Northeastern Finland, 66/69 chromosomes carrying TCD had the same haplotype at loci DXS72, DXYS1, DXYS4, and DXYS12. The same haplotype is seen in only 15/99 chromosomes not carrying TCD. Moreover, in 71/104 non-TCD chromosomes, the haplotype at six marker loci is different from those seen in any of the 76 TCD chromosomes. This supports the previously described hypothesis that the large Northern Finnish choroideremia pedigrees, comprising a total of over 80 living patients representing more than a fifth of all TCD patients described worldwide, carry the same mutation. These linkage and haplotype data provide improved opportunities for prenatal diagnosis based on RFLP studies..
Muscle expression of G6PD deficiency has been investigated in Mediterranean, Seattle-like and A-variants. G6PD activity was detected in samples obtained from biopsies on the quadriceps muscle of seven males and one female. The type of genetic variant was determined by molecular analysis of DNA, extracted from blood samples. All variants showed the enzyme defect in muscle. A statistically significant relationship was found in the activity of G6PD between erythrocytes and muscle of the male subjects (r = 0. 968; p = 0. 00008). The equation for the best fit line was Y = 0. 390X + 0. 198 198. The results suggest that, for a given variant, the extent of the enzyme defect in muscle may be determined, using this equation, from the G6PD activity of erythrocytes
Muscle expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in different variants.
Muscle phosphoglycerate mutase activity was decreased (5.7 percent of the lowest control value) in a 52-year-old man with intolerance for strenuous exercise and recurrent pigmenturia since adolescence. All of the other enzymes of glycolysis had normal activities, and glycogen concentration was normal. Electrophoretic, heat lability, and mercury inhibition studies showed that the small residual activity in the patient's muscle was represented by the brain (BB) isoenzyme of phosphoglycerate mutase, suggesting a genetic defect of the M subunit which predominates in normal muscle. The prevalence of the BB isoenzyme in other tissues, including muscle culture, may explain why symptoms were confined to muscle.

Mutation in the gene encoding the recently isolated WASP protein has now been identified as the genetic defect responsible for the X-linked Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), a primary immunodeficiency disease associated with extensive phenotypic variability. To elucidate the range of WASP mutations responsible for WAS, we used PCR-SSCP analysis to screen for WASP gene mutation in 19 unrelated boys with the diagnosis of classical or attenuated WAS or isolated thrombocytopenia. All 19 patients had WASP mutations, each of which localized to the initial three or terminal three exons of the gene, and the majority of which were unique in each case. However, a missense mutation which results in substitution of the arginine at WAS codon 86 was identified in three boys with severe WAS as well as in one boy presenting with thrombocytopenia alone. While the three mutations found in the isolated thrombocytopenia patients leave the reading frame intact, about one-half of the gene alterations detected in both severe and attenuated WAS patients result in frameshifted transcript and premature translation termination. These findings therefore confirm the association of WAS with WASP mutation and identify WASP mutation as a cause for isolated congenital thrombocytopenia in males. While the WASP gene defects responsible for isolated thrombocytopenia and other mild presentations of WAS do not appear distinct from those resulting in severe WAS, these data indicate that analysis of WASP gene mutation provides a valuable tool for distinguishing the spectrum of WAS patients and the subset of males with isolated thrombocytopenia who represent mild cases of WAS..

Mutation or deletion of the PAX6 gene underlies many cases of aniridia. Three lines of evidence now converge to implicate PAX6 more widely in anterior segment malformations including Peters anomaly. First, a child with Peters anomaly is deleted for one copy of PAX6. Second, affected members of a family with dominantly inherited anterior segment malformations, including Peters anomaly are heterozygous for an R26G mutation in the PAX6 paired box. Third, a proportion of Sey/+ Smalleye mice, heterozygous for a nonsense mutation in murine Pax-6, have an ocular phenotype resembling Peters anomaly. We therefore propose that a variety of anterior segment anomalies may be associated with PAX6 mutations..

Mutations at the PEPD locus cause prolidase deficiency (McKusick 170100), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by iminodipeptiduria, skin ulcers, mental retardation, and recurrent infections. Four PEPD mutations from five severely affected individuals were characterized by analysis of reverse-transcribed, PCR-amplified (RT-PCR) cDNA. We used SSCP analysis on four overlapping cDNA fragments covering the entire coding region of the PEPD gene and detected abnormal SSCP bands for the fragment spanning all or part of exons 13-15 in three of the probands. Direct sequencing of the mutant cDNAs showed a G-- > A, 1342 substitution (G448R) in two patients and a 3-bp deletion (delta E452 or delta E453) in another. In the other two probands the amplified products were of reduced size. Direct sequencing of these mutant cDNAs revealed a deletion of exon 5 in one patient and of exon 7 in the other. Intronic sequences flanking exons 5 and 7 were identified using inverse PCR followed by direct sequencing. Conventional PCR and direct sequencing then established the intron-exon borders of the mutant genomic DNA revealing two splice acceptor mutations a G-- > C substitution at position -1 of intron 4 and an A-- > G substitution at position -2 of intron 6. Our results indicate that the severe form of prolidase deficiency is caused by multiple PEPD alleles. In this report we attempt to begin the process of describing these alleles and cataloging their phenotypic expression..
Mutations at the PKD1 locus account for 85% of cases of the common genetic disorder called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Screening for mutations of the PKD1 gene is complicated by the genomic structure of the 5'-duplicated region encoding 75% of the gene. To date, more than 90 mutations of the PKD1 gene have been reported in the European and American populations, and relatively little information is available concerning the pattern of mutations present in the Asian populations. We looked for mutations of the PKD1 gene in 51 unrelated Korean ADPKD patients, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primer pairs located in the 3' single-copy region of the PKD1 gene and by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. We found three novel mutations, a G to A substitution at nucleotide 11012 (G3601S), a C to A substitution at nucleotide 11312 (Q3701X), and a C to T substitution at nucleotide 12971 (P4254S), and a single polymorphism involving a G to C substitution at nucleotide 11470 (L3753L). These mutations were not found in control individuals, and no other mutations in the 3' single-copy region of the PKD1 gene of patients with these mutations were observed. In particular, P4254S segregated with the disease phenotype. The clinical data of affected individuals from this study, and of previously reported Korean PKD1 mutations, showed that patients with frameshift or nonsense mutations were more prone to develop end-stage renal failure than those with missense mutations. Our findings indicate that many different PKD1 mutations are likely to be responsible for ADPKD in the Korean population, as in the Western population.
Mutations at the ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) locus on chromosome band 11q22 cause a distinctive autosomal recessive syndrome in homozygotes and predispose heterozygotes to cancer, ischemic heart disease, and early mortality. PCR amplification from genomic DNA and automated sequencing of the entire coding region (66 exons) and splice junctions detected 77 mutations (85%) in 90 A-T chromosomes. Heteroduplex analysis detected another 42 mutations at the A-T locus. Out of a total of 71 unique mutations, 50 were found only in a single family, and 51 had not been reported previously. Most (58/71, 82%) mutations were frameshift and nonsense mutations that are predicted to cause truncation of the A-T protein; the less common mutation types were missense (9/71, 13%), splicing (3/71, 4%) and one in-frame deletion, 2546 3 (1/71, 1%). The mean survival and height distribution of 134 A-T patients correlated significantly with the specific mutations present in the patients. Patients homozygous for a single truncating mutation, typically near the N-terminal end of the gene, or heterozygous for the in-frame deletion 2546 3, were shorter and had significantly shorter survival than those heterozygous for a splice site or missense mutation, or heterozygous for two truncating mutations. Alterations of the length or amino acid composition of the A-T gene product affect the A-T clinical phenotype in different ways. Mutation analysis at the A-T locus may help estimate the prognosis of A-T patients..
Mutations at the ataxia-telangiectasia locus and clinical phenotypes of A-T patients.
Mutations at the hexosaminidase A (HEXA) gene which cause Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) have elevated frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish and French-Canadian populations. We report a novel TSD allele in the French-Canadian population associated with the infantile form of the disease. The mutation, a G-- > A transition at the + 1 position of intron 7, abolishes the donor splice site. Cultured human fibroblasts from a compound heterozygote for this transition (and for a deletion mutation) produce no detectable HEXA mRNA. The intron 7 + 1 mutation occurs in the base adjacent to the site of the adult-onset TSD mutation (G805A). In both mutations a restriction site for the endonuclease EcoRII is abolished. Unambiguous diagnosis, therefore, requires allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization to distinguish between these two mutant alleles. The intron 7 + 1 mutation has been detected in three unrelated families. Obligate heterozygotes for the intron 7 + 1 mutation were born in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region of Quebec. The most recent ancestors common to obligate carriers of this mutation were from the Charlevoix region of the province of Quebec. This mutation thus has a different geographic centre of diffusion and is probably less common than the exon 1 deletion TSD mutation in French Canadians. Neither mutation has been detected in France, the ancestral homeland of French Canada..
Mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus are the major cause of hyperphenylalaninemia. We have previously described four mutations (M1V, IVS12nt1, R408W, and S349P) at the PAH locus in French Canadians with ancestry in eastern Quebec. Here we report (1) identification of another mutation, on a haplotype 9 chromosome, which converts codon 65 from isoleucine (ATT) to threonine (ACT), (2) expression analysis of the I65T mutation in COS cells demonstrating 75% loss of both immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity, and (3) expression analysis of the most prevalent PKU allele (M1V) in eastern Quebec, showing nondetectable levels of PAH protein and activity, a finding compatible with a mutation in the translation initiation codon. Homozygosity for M1V and codominant inheritance of I65T/R408W were both associated with classical phenylketonuria..
Mutations in APC are classically associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple intestinal polyps and, without surgical intervention, the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). APC is a tumour-suppressor gene, and somatic loss occurs in tumours. The germline T-to-A transversion responsible for the APC I1307K allele converts the wild-type sequence to a homopolymer tract (A8) that is genetically unstable and prone to somatic mutation. The I1307K allele was found in 6. 1% of unselected Ashkenazi Jews and higher proportions of Ashkenazim with family or personal histories of CRC (ref. 2). To evaluate the role of I1307K in cancer, we genotyped 5, 081 Ashkenazi volunteers in a community survey. Risk of developing colorectal, breast and other cancers were compared between genotyped I1307K carriers and non-carriers and their first-degree relatives.
Mutations in KRIT1, a protein initially identified based on a yeast two-hybrid interaction with the RAS-family GTPase RAP1A, are responsible for the development of the inherited vascular disorder cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM1). As the function of the KRIT1 protein and its role in CCM pathogenesis remain unknown, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens to identify additional protein binding partners. A fragment containing the N-terminal 272 amino acid residues of KRIT1, a region lacking similarity to any known protein upon database searches, was used as bait. From parallel screens of human fetal brain and HeLa cDNA libraries, we obtained multiple independent isolates of human integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1 (ICAP-1) as interacting clones. The interaction of KRIT1 and ICAP-1 was confirmed by GST-KRIT1 trapping of endogenous ICAP-1 from 293T cells. The alpha isoform of ICAP-1 is a 200 amino acid serine/threonine-rich phosphoprotein which binds the cytoplasmic tail of beta1 integrins. We show that mutagenesis of the N-terminal KRIT1 NPXY amino acid sequence, a motif critical for ICAP-1 binding to beta1 integrin molecules, completely abrogates the KRIT1/ICAP-1 interaction. The interaction between ICAP-1 and KRIT1, and the presence of a FERM domain in the latter, suggest that KRIT1 might be involved in the bidirectional signaling between integrin molecules and the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, these data suggest that KRIT1 might affect cell adhesion processes via integrin signaling in CCM1 pathogenesis.
Mutations in PAX6 are responsible for human aniridia and have also been found in patients with Peters anomaly, with congenital cataracts, with autosomal dominant keratitis, and with isolated foveal hypoplasia. No locus other than chromosome 11p13 has been implicated in aniridia, and PAX6 is clearly the major, if not only, gene responsible. Twenty-eight percent of identified PAX6 mutations are C-T changes at CpG dinucleotides, 20% are splicing errors, and more than 30% are deletion or insertion events. There is a noticeably elevated level of mutation in the paired domain compared with the rest of the gene. Increased mutation in the homeodomain is accounted for by the hypermutable CpG dinucleotide in codon 240. Very nearly all mutations appear to cause loss of function of the mutant allele, and more than 80% of exonic substitutions result in nonsense codons. In a gene with such extraordinarily high sequence conservation throughout evolution, there are presumed undiscovered missense mutations, these are hypothesized to exist in as-yet unidentified phenotypes..
Mutations in PROP1 cause familial combined pituitary hormone deficiency.
Mutations in TNFRSF11A, affecting the signal peptide of RANK, cause familial expansile osteolysis.
Mutations in atm and p53 cause the human cancer-associated diseases ataxia-telangiectasia and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, respectively. The two genes are believed to interact in a number of pathways, including regulation of DNA damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoints, apoptosis and radiation sensitivity, and cellular proliferation. Atm-null mice, as well as those null for p53, develop mainly T-cell lymphomas, supporting the view that these genes have similar roles in thymocyte development. To study the interactions of these two genes on an organismal level, we bred mice heterozygous for null alleles of both atm and p53 to produce all genotypic combinations. Mice doubly null for atm and p53 exhibited a dramatic acceleration of tumour formation relative to singly null mice, indicating that both genes collaborate in a significant manner to prevent tumorigenesis. With respect to their roles in apoptosis, loss of atm rendered thymocytes only partly resistant to irradiation-induced apoptosis, whereas additional loss of p53 engendered complete resistance. This implies that the irradiation-induced atm and p53 apoptotic pathways are not completely congruent. Finally-and in contrast to prior predictions-atm and p53 do not appear to interact in acute radiation toxicity, suggesting a separate atm effector pathway for this DNA damage response and having implications for the prognosis and treatment of human tumours..
Mutations in either LIS1 or DCX are the most common cause for type I lissencephaly. Here we report that LIS1 and DCX interact physically both in vitro and in vivo. Epitope-tagged DCX transiently expressed in COS cells can be co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous LIS1. Furthermore, endogenous DCX could be co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous LIS1 in embryonic brain extracts, demonstrating an in vivo association. The two protein products also co-localize in transfected cells and in primary neuronal cells. In addition, we demonstrate homodimerization of DCX in vitro. Using fragments of both LIS1 and DCX, the domains of interaction were mapped. LIS1 and DCX interact with tubulin and microtubules. Our results suggest that addition of DCX and LIS1 to tubulin enhances polymerization in an additive fashion. In in vitro competition assays, when LIS1 is added first, DCX competes with LIS1 in its binding to microtubules, but when DCX is added prior to the addition of LIS1 it enhances the binding of LIS1 to microtubules. We conclude that LIS1 and DCX cross-talk is important to microtubule function in the developing cerebral cortex.
Mutations in the BRCA1 (ref. 1) tumour suppressor gene are found in almost all of the families with inherited breast and ovarian cancers and about half of the families with only breast cancer. Although the biochemical function of BRCA1 is not well understood, it is important for DNA damage repair and cell-cycle checkpoint. BRCA1 exists in nuclear foci but is hyperphosphorylated and disperses after DNA damage. It is not known whether BRCA1 phosphorylation and dispersion and its function in DNA damage response are related. In yeast the DNA damage response and the replication-block checkpoint are mediated partly through the Cds1 kinase family. Here we report that the human Cds1 kinase (hCds1/Chk2) regulates BRCA1 function after DNA damage by phosphorylating serine 988 of BRCA1. We show that hCds1 and BRCA1 interact and co-localize within discrete nuclear foci but separate after gamma irradiation. Phosphorylation of BRCA1 at serine 988 is required for the release of BRCA1 from hCds1. This phosphorylation is also important for the ability of BRCA1 to restore survival after DNA damage in the BRCA1-mutated cell line HCC1937..
Mutations in the BRCA1 gene in families with early-onset breast and ovarian cancer.
Mutations in the BRCA1 gene, discovered in 1994, are associated with an 80-90% lifetime risk of breast cancer. We have analysed 60 families with a history of breast and/or ovarian cancer for germline mutations in BRCA1. Twenty-two different mutations were detected in 32 families (53%), of which 14 are previously unreported. We observed a significant correlation between the location of the mutation in the gene and the ratio of breast to ovarian cancer incidence within each family. Our data suggest a transition in risk such that mutations in the 3 third of the gene are associated with a lower proportion of ovarian cancer. Haplotype analysis supports previous data which suggest some BRCA1 mutation carriers have common ancestors; however, we have found at least two examples where recurrent mutations appear to have arisen independently..
Mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster zw10 gene, which encodes a conserved, essential kinetochore component, abolish the ability of dynein to localize to kinetochores. Several similarities between the behavior of ZW10 protein and dynein further support a role for ZW10 in the recruitment of dynein to the kinetochore: (a) in response to bipolar tension across the chromosomes, both proteins mostly leave the kinetochore at metaphase, when their association with the spindle becomes apparent; (b) ZW10 and dynein both bind to functional neocentromeres of structurally acentric minichromosomes; and (c) the localization of both ZW10 and dynein to the kinetochore is abolished in cells mutant for the gene rough deal. ZW10's role in the recruitment of dynein to the kinetochore is likely to be reasonably direct, because dynamitin, the p50 subunit of the dynactin complex, interacts with ZW10 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Since in zw10 mutants no defects in chromosome behavior are observed before anaphase onset, our results suggest that dynein at the kinetochore is essential for neither microtubule capture nor congression to the metaphase plate. Instead, dynein's role at the kinetochore is more likely to be involved in the coordination of chromosome separation and/or poleward movement at anaphase onset.
Mutations in the HEXA gene, encoding the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A), that abolish Hex A enzyme activity cause Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), the fatal infantile form of G (M2) gangliosidosis, Type 1. Less severe, subacute (juvenile-onset) and chronic (adult-onset) variants are characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and are associated with residual levels of Hex A enzyme activity. We identified a 1422 G-- > C (amino acid W474C) substitution in the first position of exon 13 of HEXA of a non-Jewish proband who manifested a subacute variant of G (M2) gangliosidosis. On the second maternally inherited allele, we identified the common infantile disease-causing 4-bp insertion, + TATC 1278, in exon 11. Pulse-chase analysis using proband fibroblasts revealed that the W474C-containing alpha-subunit precursor was normally synthesized, but not phosphorylated or secreted, and the mature lysosomal alpha-subunit was not detected. When the W474C-containing alpha-subunit was transiently co-expressed with the beta-subunit to produce Hex A (alphabeta) in COS-7 cells, the mature alpha-subunit was present, but its level was much lower than that from normal alpha-subunit transfections, although higher than in those cells transfected with an alpha-subunit associated with infantile TSD. Furthermore, the precursor level of the W474C alpha-subunit was found to accumulate in comparison to the normal alpha-subunit precursor levels. We conclude that the 1422 G-- > C mutation is the cause of Hex A enzyme deficiency in the proband. The resulting W474C substitution clearly interferes with alpha-subunit processing, but because the base substitution falls at the first position of exon 13, aberrant splicing may also contribute to Hex A deficiency in this proband..
Mutations in the PAX6 gene in patients with hereditary aniridia.
Mutations in the PCSK9 gene in Norwegian subjects with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia.
Mutations in the RB1 gene and their effects on transcription.
Mutations in the SMAD4/DPC4 tumor suppressor gene, a key signal transducer in most TGFbeta-related pathways, are involved in 50% of pancreatic cancers. Homozygous Smad4 mutant mice die before day 7. 5 of embryogenesis. Mutant embryos have reduced size, fail to gastrulate or express a mesodermal marker, and show abnormal visceral endoderm development. Growth retardation of the Smad4-deficient embryos results from reduced cell proliferation rather than increased apoptosis. Aggregation of mutant Smad4 ES cells with wild-type tetraploid morulae rescues the gastrulation defect. These results indicate that Smad4 is initially required for the differentiation of the visceral endoderm and that the gastrulation defect in the epiblast is secondary and non-cell autonomous. Rescued embryos show severe anterior truncations, indicating a second important role for Smad4 in anterior patterning during embryogenesis.
Mutations in the STA gene at the Xq28 locus have been found in patients with X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). This gene encodes a hitherto unknown protein named emerin. To elucidate the subcellular localization of emerin, we raised two antisera against synthetic peptide fragments predicted from emerin cDNA. Using both antisera, we found positive nuclear membrane staining in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles in the normal controls and in patients with neuromuscular diseases other than EDMD. In contrast, a deficiency in immunofluorescent staining of skeletal and cardiac muscle from EDMD patients was observed. A 34 kD protein is immunoreactive with the antisera--the protein is equivalent to that predicted for emerin. Together, our findings suggest the specific deficiency of emerin in the nuclear membrane of muscle cells in patients with EDMD..
Mutations in the WT1 gene were anticipated to explain the genetic basis of the childhood kidney cancer, Wilms tumour (WT). Six years on, we review 100 reports of intragenic WT1 mutations and examine the accompanying clinical phenotypes. While only 5% of sporadic Wilms tumours have intragenic WT1 mutations, > 90% of patients with the Denys-Drash syndrome (renal nephropathy, gonadal anomaly, predisposition to WT) carry constitutional intragenic WT1 mutations. WT1 mutations have also been reported in juvenile granulosa cell tumour, non-asbestos related mesothelioma, desmoplastic small round cell tumour and, most recently, acute myeloid leukemia..
Mutations in the arginine-rich protein gene (ARP) in pancreatic cancer.
Mutations in the brain specific P/Q type Ca2 + channel alpha1 subunit gene, CACNA1A, have been identified in three clinically distinct disorders, viz. episodic ataxia type 2 (EA-2), familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) and spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6). For individuals with EA-2, the mutations described thus far are presumed to result in a truncated protein product. Several different missense mutations have been identified in patients with FHM. At least two of these mutations have been identified on two different chromosome 19p13 haplotypes and thus represent recurrent mutations. In the present study, we have screened several individuals for mutations in all 47 exons in the CACNA1A gene by single-strand conformation analysis. We have characterised a novel missense mutation, G5260A, in exon 32 in a family segregating for EA-2. The consequence of this mutation is an amino acid substitution at a highly conserved position within the CACNA1A gene. This represents the first point mutation not resulting in a proposed truncated protein. Furthermore, this mutation has been detected in a family member with mild clinical signs including only migraine. Additionally, a second previously identified recurrent muta tion, C2272T, in exon 16 has been discovered in a patient with FHM..
Mutations in the candidate gene for Norrie disease.
Mutations in the diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter gene DTDST have been associated with a family of chondrodysplasias that comprises, in order of increasing severity, diastrophic dysplasia (DTD), atelosteogenesis type 2 (AO2), and achondrogenesis type 1B (ACG1B). To learn more about the molecular basis of DTDST chondrodysplasias and about genotype-phenotype correlations, we studied fibroblast cultures of three new patients one with AO-2, one with DTD, and one with an intermediate phenotype (AO2/DTD). Reduced incorporation of inorganic sulfate into macromolecules was found in all three. Each of the three patients was found to be heterozygous for a c862t transition predicting a R279W substitution in the third extracellular loop of DTDST. In two patients (DTD and AO2/DTD), no other structural mutation was found, but polymerase chain reaction amplification and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of fibroblast cDNA showed reduced mRNA levels of the wild-type DTDST allele these two patients may be compound heterozygotes for the " Finnish " mutation (as yet uncharacterized at the DNA level), which causes reduced expression of DTDST. The third patient (with AO2) had the R279W mutation compounded with a novel mutation, the deletion of cytosine 418 (delta c418), predicting a frameshift with premature termination. Also the delta c418 allele was underrepresented in the cDNA, in accordance with previous observations that premature stop codons reduce mRNA levels. The presence of the DTDST R279W mutation in a total of 11 patients with AO2 or DTD emphasizes the overlap between these conditions. This mutation has not been found so far in 8 analyzed ACG1B patients, suggesting that it allows some residual activity of the sulfate transporter..
Mutations in the fibrinogen aalpha gene account for the majority of cases of congenital afibrinogenemia.
Mutations in the gene ATM are responsible for the genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), which is characterized by cerebellar dysfunction, radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition. Both the A-T phenotype and the similarity of the ATM protein to other DNA-damage sensors suggests a role for ATM in biochemical pathways involved in the recognition, signalling and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). There are strong parallels between the pattern of radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition in A-T patients and that in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). The protein defective in NBS, nibrin (encoded by NBS1), forms a complex with MRE11 and RAD50 (refs 1, 2). This complex localizes to DSBs within 30 minutes after cellular exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and is observed in brightly staining nuclear foci after a longer period of time. The overlap between clinical and cellular phenotypes in A-T and NBS suggests that ATM and nibrin may function in the same biochemical pathway. Here we demonstrate that nibrin is phosphorylated within one hour of treatment of cells with IR. This response is abrogated in A-T cells that either do not express ATM protein or express near full-length mutant protein. We also show that ATM physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine 343 both in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation of this site appears to be functionally important because mutated nibrin (S343A) does not completely complement radiosensitivity in NBS cells. ATM phosphorylation of nibrin does not affect nibrin-MRE11-RAD50 association as revealed by radiation-induced foci formation. Our data provide a biochemical explanation for the similarity in phenotype between A-T and NBS..
Mutations in the gene encoding granulin (HUGO gene symbol GRN, also referred to as progranulin, PGRN), located at chromosome 17q21, were recently linked to tau-negative ubiquitin-positive frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLDU). Since then, 63 heterozygous mutations were identified in 163 families worldwide, all leading to loss of functional GRN, implicating a haploinsufficiency mechanism. Together, these mutations explained 5 to 10% of FTLD. The high mutation frequency, however, might still be an underestimation because not all patient samples were examined for all types of loss-of-function mutations and because several variants, including missense mutations, have a yet uncertain pathogenic significance. Although the complete phenotypic spectrum associated with GRN mutations is not yet fully characterized, it was shown that it is highly heterogeneous, suggesting the influence of modifying factors. A role of GRN in neuronal survival was suggested but the exact mechanism by which neurodegeneration and deposition of pathologic brain inclusions occur still has to be clarified.
Mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the rod cGMP-gated channel in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.
Mutations in the gene for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in patients with different clinical phenotypes.
Mutations in the genes encoding two proteins of the retinal rod phototransduction cascade, opsin and the beta subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase, cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in some families. Here we report defects in a third member of this biochemical pathway in still other patients with this disease. We screened 94 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant RP and 173 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive RP for mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the rod cGMP-gated cation channel. Five mutant sequences cosegregated with disease among four unrelated families with autosomal recessive RP. Two of these were nonsense mutations early in the reading frame (Glu76End and Lys139End) and one was a deletion encompassing most if not all of the transcriptional unit; these three alleles would not be expected to encode a functional channel. The remaining two mutations were a missense mutation (Ser316Phe) and a frameshift [Arg654(1-bp del)] mutation truncating the last 32 aa in the C terminus. The latter two mutations were expressed in vitro and found to encode proteins that were predominantly retained inside the cell instead of being targeted to the plasma membrane. We conclude that the absence or paucity of functional cGMP-gated cation channels in the plasma membrane is deleterious to rod photoreceptors and is an uncommon cause of RP.
Mutations in the glycine decarboxylase gene (GLDC) cause nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), an in-born error of metabolism characterized by severe neurological disturbance. We have determined the structure of GLDC and of its pseudogene (psiGLDC) and studied their expression for a molecular analysis of NKH. The GLDC gene spans at least 135 kb and consists of 25 exons. All donor and acceptor sites adhere to the canonical GT-AG rule, except for the donor site of intron 21, where a variant form GC is used instead of GT. The transcription initiation site has been assigned to a residue 163 bp upstream from the translation initiation triplet by primer extension analysis. The psiGLDC gene has no intron and shares 97. 5% homology with the coding region of functional GLDC, suggesting that psiGLDC is a processed pseudogene that arose from the GLDC transcript about 4-8 million years ago. RNA blotting analysis has revealed that GLDC is expressed in human liver, kidney, brain, and placenta. We have also examined a patient with NKH with no detectable GLDC mRNA in his lymphoblasts. Exons 1-3 of the functional GLDC gene from this patient are not amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whereas those from control subjects are. These results suggest a large homozygous deletion (at least 30 kb) in the patient. Furthermore, we have devised a semi-quantitative PCR to estimate the number of GLDC alleles by using psiGLDC as an internal control and have confirmed the homozygosity and heterozygosity of the deletion in the patient and his parents, respectively. Structural information of GLDC and psiGLDC should facilitate the molecular analysis of NKH.
Mutations in the human alpha-tectorin gene cause autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment.
Mutations in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene producing phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia have now been identified in many patients from various ethnic groups. These mutations all exhibit a high degree of association with specific restriction fragment-length polymorphism haplotypes at the PAH locus. About 50 of these mutations are single-base substitutions, including six nonsense mutations and eight splicing mutations, with the remainder being missense mutations. One splicing mutation results in a 3 amino acid in-frame insertion. Two or 3 large deletions, 2 single codon deletions, and 2 single base deletions have been found. Twelve of the missense mutations apparently result from the methylation and subsequent deamination of highly mutagenic CpG dinucleotides. Recurrent mutation has been observed at several of these sites, producing associations with different haplotypes in different populations. About half of all missense mutations have been examined by in vitro expression analysis, and a significant correlation has been observed between residual PAH activity and disease phenotype. Since continuing advances in molecular methodologies have dramatically accelerated the rate in which new mutations are being identified and characterized, this register of mutations will be updated periodically..
Mutations in the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IMPDH1) cause the RP10 form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.
Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most frequent genetic alterations found in human cancers. Recent identification of two human homologues of p53 has raised the prospect of functional interactions between family members via a conserved oligomerization domain. Here we report in vitro and in vivo analysis of homo- and hetero-oligomerization of p53 and its homologues, p63 and p73. The oligomerization domains of p63 and p73 can independently fold into stable homotetramers, as previously observed for p53. However, the oligomerization domain of p53 does not associate with that of either p73 or p63, even when p53 is in 15-fold excess. On the other hand, the oligomerization domains of p63 and p73 are able to weakly associate with one another in vitro. In vivo co-transfection assays of the ability of p53 and its homologues to activate reporter genes showed that a DNA-binding mutant of p53 was not able to act in a dominant negative manner over wild-type p73 or p63 but that a p73 mutant could inhibit the activity of wild-type p63. These data suggest that mutant p53 in cancer cells will not interact with endogenous or exogenous p63 or p73 via their respective oligomerization domains. It also establishes that the multiple isoforms of p63 as well as those of p73 are capable of interacting via their common oligomerization domain.
Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are frequent in most human cancers. Comparison of the mutation patterns in different cancers may reveal clues on the natural history of the disease. Over the past 10 years, several databases of TP53 mutations have been developed. The most extensive of these databases is maintained and developed at the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The database compiles all mutations (somatic and inherited), as well as polymorphisms, that have been reported in the published literature since 1989. The IARC TP53 mutation dataset is the largest dataset available on the variations of any human gene. The database is available at www.iarc.fr/P53/. In this paper, we describe recent developments of the database. These developments include restructuring of the database, which is now patient-centered, with more detailed annotations on the patient (carcinogen exposure, virus infection, genetic background). In addition, a new on-line application to retrieve somatic mutation data and analyze mutation patterns is now available. We also discuss limitations on the use of the database and provide recommendations to users.
Mutations in the yeast gene VPS41 give rise to poor growth on low iron medium, severe alterations in vacuolar morphology, and cause the missorting of membranous and soluble vacuolar proteins. Our studies predict that VPS41 encodes a hydrophilic protein of 992 amino acids that contains no obvious signal sequence or hydrophobic domains. The deduced Vps41p sequence contains a domain rich in glutamic and aspartic residues, as well as a domain with resemblance to a region of clathrin heavy chain. We have also identified and sequenced putative VPS41 homologues from Caenorhabditis elegans, plants, and humans. The VPS41 homologues (but not the yeast VPS41 itself) contain a conserved cysteine-rich RING-H2 zinc finger at their COOH termini. Biochemical experiments suggest that VPS41 functions in post-Golgi protein processing: the deletion mutant exhibits defective high affinity transport due to impaired Fet3p activity and also exhibits defects in the processing and sorting of multiple vacuolar hydrolases.
Mutations of APC appear to initiate sporadic and inherited forms of human colorectal cancer. Although these mutations have been well characterized, little is known about the function of the APC gene product. Two cellular proteins that associate with APC were identified by nucleotide sequence analysis and peptide mapping as the E-cadherin-associated proteins alpha- and beta-catenin. A 27-residue fragment of APC containing a 15-amino acid repeat was sufficient for the interaction with the catenins. These results suggest an important link between tumor initiation and cell adhesion..
Mutations of the ATM gene detected in Japanese ataxia-telangiectasia patients: possible preponderance of the two founder mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5.
Mutations of the BRCA1 gone in humans are associated with predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers. We show here that Brca1 +/- mice are normal and fertile and lack tumors by age eleven months. Homozygous Brca1 (5-6) mutant mice die before day 7. 5 of embryogenesis. Mutant embryos are poorly developed, with no evidence of mesoderm formation. The extraembryonic region is abnormal, but aggregation with wild-type tetraploid embryos does not rescue the lethality. In vivo, mutant embryos do not exhibit increased apoptosis but show reduced cell proliferation accompanied by decreased expression of cyclin E and mdm-2, a regulator of p53 activity. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is dramatically increased in the mutant embryos. Buttressing these in vivo observations is the fact that mutant blastocyst growth is grossly impaired in vitro. Thus, the death of Brca1 (5-6) mutant embryos prior to gastrulation may be due to a failure of the proliferative burst required for the development of the different germ layers.
Mutations of the VHL gene in sporadic renal cell carcinoma: definition of a risk factor for VHL patients to develop an RCC.
Mutations of the cathepsin C gene are responsible for Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.
Mutations of the human PAX6 gene underlie aniridia (congenital absence of the iris), a rare dominant malformation of the eye. The spectrum of PAX6 mutations in aniridia patients is highly biased, with 92% of all reported mutations leading to premature truncation of the protein (nonsense, splicing, insertions and deletions) and just 2% leading to substitution of one amino acid by another (missense). The extraordinary conservation of the PAX6 protein at the amino acid level amongst vertebrates predicts that pathological missense mutations should in fact be common even though they are hardly ever seen in aniridia patients. This indicates that there is a heavy ascertainment bias in the selection of patients for PAX6 mutation analysis and that the missing PAX6 missense mutations frequently may underlie phenotypes distinct from textbook aniridia. Here we present four novel PAX6 missense mutations, two in association with atypical phenotypes ectopia pupillae (displaced pupils) and congenital nystagmus (searching gaze), and two in association with more recognizable aniridia phenotypes. Strikingly, all four mutations are located within the PAX6 paired domain and affect amino acids which are highly conserved in all known paired domain proteins. Our results support the hypothesis that the under-representation of missense mutations is caused by ascertainment bias and suggest that a substantial burden of PAX6 -related disease remains to be uncovered..
Mutations responsible for Larsen syndrome cluster in the FLNB protein.
Mutations resulting in defective splicing constitute a significant proportion (30/62 [48%]) of a new series of mutations in the ATM gene in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) that were detected by the protein-truncation assay followed by sequence analysis of genomic DNA. Fewer than half of the splicing mutations involved the canonical AG splice-acceptor site or GT splice-donor site. A higher percentage of mutations occurred at less stringently conserved sites, including silent mutations of the last nucleotide of exons, mutations in nucleotides other than the conserved AG and GT in the consensus splice sites, and creation of splice-acceptor or splice-donor sites in either introns or exons. These splicing mutations led to a variety of consequences, including exon skipping and, to a lesser degree, intron retention, activation of cryptic splice sites, or creation of new splice sites. In addition, 5 of 12 nonsense mutations and 1 missense mutation were associated with deletion in the cDNA of the exons in which the mutations occurred. No ATM protein was detected by western blotting in any AT cell line in which splicing mutations were identified. Several cases of exon skipping in both normal controls and patients for whom no underlying defect could be found in genomic DNA were also observed, suggesting caution in the interpretation of exon deletions observed in ATM cDNA when there is no accompanying identification of genomic mutations..

Mxi1 belongs to the Mad (Mxi1) family of proteins, which function as potent antagonists of Myc oncoproteins. This antagonism relates partly to their ability to compete with Myc for the protein Max and for consensus DNA binding sites and to recruit transcriptional co-repressors. Mad(Mxi1) proteins have been suggested to be essential in cellular growth control and/or in the induction and maintenance of the differentiated state. Consistent with these roles, mxi1 may be the tumour-suppressor gene that resides at region 24-26 of the long arm of chromosome 10. This region is a cancer hotspot, and mutations here may be involved in several cancers, including prostate adenocarcinoma. Here we show that mice lacking Mxi1 exhibit progressive, multisystem abnormalities. These mice also show increased susceptibility to tumorigenesis either following carcinogen treatment or when also deficient in Ink4a. This cancer-prone phenotype may correlate with the enhanced ability of several mxi1-deficient cell types, including prostatic epithelium, to proliferate. Our results show that Mxi1 is involved in the homeostasis of differentiated organ systems, acts as a tumour suppressor in vivo, and engages the Myc network in a functionally relevant manner.
Mxi1 is thought to negatively regulate Myc function and may therefore be a potential tumor suppressor gene. Little effort has yet been made to find alterations involving this gene in human solid tumors. We screened 31 human gastric cancers, 7 esophageal cancers, 85 bone and soft tissue tumors of various types, including 4 neurofibrosarcomas. We also examined 29 human tumor cell lines consisting of 12 esophageal cancers, 7 glioma/glioblastomas and 10 others for Mxi1 mutations in exons 1, 2, 4 (HLH domain), 5 and 6. Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and subsequent sequencing revealed three distinct polymorphisms in the intron-exon boundary upstream from exon 6. We discovered a missense mutation, GCA to GTA (Ala 54 Val), in exon 2 in a neurofibrosarcoma patient (case 1), two missense mutations, AAA to CAA (Lys 118 Gln) and GAA to GGA (Glu 154 Gly) in exon 5 of another neurofibrosarcoma patient (case 2), and 3 amino acid substitutions, GTG to GCG (Val 179 Ala), GTT to GCT (Val 181 Ala) and TTC to CTC (Phe 186 Leu), in a third neurofibrosarcoma patient (case 3). In case 3, loss of heterozygosity was also demonstrated by informative (TTC) 3/(TTC) 2 polymorphism. Our data demonstrate that mutations occur in the Mxi1 gene in neurofibrosarcoma. Missense mutations in the functional domain of Mxi1 in these cases may be involved in the pathogenesis of neurofibrosarcoma..

Myotonia congenita (MC) is caused by a defect in the skeletal muscle chloride channel function, which may cause sustained membrane depolarisation. We describe a previously healthy 32-year-old woman who developed a life-threatening muscle spasm and secondary ventilation difficulties following a preoperative injection of suxamethonium. The muscle spasms disappeared spontaneously and the surgery proceeded without further problems. When subsequently questioned, she reported minor symptoms suggesting a myotonic condition. Myotonia was found on clinical examination and EMG. The diagnosis MC was confirmed genetically. Neither the patient nor the anaesthetist were aware of the diagnosis before this potentially lethal complication occurred. We give a brief overview of ion channel disorders including malignant hyperthermia and their anaesthetic considerations.
Myotonia levior is a chloride channel disorder.
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder which results from elongations of an unstable (CTG) n repeat, located in the 3 untranslated region of the DM gene. A correlation has been demonstrated between the increase in the repeat number of this sequence and the severity of the disease. However, the clinical status of patients cannot be unambiguously ascertained solely on the basis of the number of CTG repeats. Moreover, the exclusive maternal inheritance of the congenital form remains unexplained. Our observation of differently sized repeats in various DM tissues from the same individual may explain why the size of the mutation observed in lymphocytes does not necessarily correlate with the severity and nature of symptoms. Through a molecular and genetic study of 142 families including 418 DM patients, we have investigated the dynamics of the CTG repeat meiotic instability. A positive correlation between the size of the repeat and the intergenerational enlargement was observed similarly through male and female meioses for < or = 0. 5-kb CTG sequences. Beyond 0. 5 kb, the intergenerational variation was more important through female meioses, whereas a tendency to compression was observed almost exclusively in male meioses, for > or = 1. 5-kb fragments. This implies a size- and sex-dependent meiotic instability. Moreover, segregation analysis supports the hypothesis of a maternal as well as a familial predisposition for the occurrence of the congenital form. Finally, this analysis reveals a significant excess of transmitting grandfathers partially accounted for by increased fertility in affected males
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disease which, in the typical pedigree, shows a three generation anticipation cascade. This results in infertility and congenital myotonic dystrophy (CDM) with the disappearance of DM in that pedigree. The concept of segregation distortion, where there is preferential transmission of the larger allele at the DM locus, has been put forward to explain partially the maintenance of DM in the population. In a survey of DM in Northern Ireland, 59 pedigrees were ascertained. Sibships where the status of all the members had been identified were examined to determine the transmission of the DM expansion from affected parents to their offspring. Where the transmitting parent was male, 58. 3% of the offspring were affected, and in the case of a female transmitting parent, 68. 7% were affected. Studies on meiotic drive in DM have shown increased transmission of the larger allele at the DM locus in non-DM heterozygotes for CTGn. This study provides further evidence that the DM expansion tends to be transmitted preferentially.
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal muscle wasting, myotonia, cardiac arrhythmia, hyperinsulinaemia, mental retardation and ocular cataracts. The genetic defect in DM is a CTG repeat expansion located in the 3 untranslated region of DMPK and 5 of a homeodomain-encoding gene, SIX5 (formerly DMAHP; refs 2-5). There are three mechanisms by which CTG expansion can result in DM. First, repeat expansion may alter the processing or transport of the mutant DMPK mRNA and consequently reduce DMPK levels. Second, CTG expansion may establish a region of heterochromatin 3 of the repeat sequence and decrease SIX5 transcription. Third, toxic effects of the repeat expansion may be intrinsic to the repeated elements at the level of DNA or RNA (refs 10, 11). Previous studies have demonstrated that a dose-dependent loss of Dm15 (the mouse DMPK homologue) in mice produces a partial DM phenotype characterized by decreased development of skeletal muscle force and cardiac conduction disorders. To test the role of Six5 loss in DM, we have analysed a strain of mice in which Six5 was deleted. Our results demonstrate that the rate and severity of cataract formation is inversely related to Six5 dosage and is temporally progressive. Six5 +/- and Six5-/- mice show increased steady-state levels of the Na +/K + -ATPase alpha-1 subunit and decreased Dm15 mRNA levels. Thus, altered ion homeostasis within the lens may contribute to cataract formation. As ocular cataracts are a characteristic feature of DM, these results demonstrate that decreased SIX5 transcription is important in the aetiology of DM. Our data support the hypothesis that DM is a contiguous gene syndrome associated with the partial loss of both DMPK and SIX5..
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3 untranslated region of a putative protein kinase (DMPK). To elucidate the role of DMPK in DM pathogenesis we have developed Dmpk deficient (Dmpk-/-) mice. Dmpk-/-mice develop a late-onset, progressive skeletal myopathy that shares some pathological features with DM. Muscles from mature mice show variation in fibre size, increased fibre degeneration and fibrosis. Adult Dmpk-/-mice show ultrastructural changes in muscle and a 50% decrease in force generation compared to young mice. Our results indicate that DMPK may be necessary for the maintenance of skeletal muscle structure and function and suggest that a decrease in DMPK levels may contribute to DM pathology..
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is associated with a (CTG) n trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 3-untranslated region of a protein kinase-encoding gene, DMPK, which maps to chromosome 19q13. 3. Characterisation of the expression of this gene in patient tissues has thus far generated conflicting data on alterations in the steady state levels of DMPK mRNA, and on the final DMPK protein levels in the presence of the expansion. The DM region of chromosome 19 is gene rich, and it is possible that the repeat expansion may lead to dysfunction of a number of transcription units in the vicinity, perhaps as a consequence of chromatin disruption. We have searched for genes associated with a CpG island at the 3 end of DMPK. Sequencing of this region shows that the island extends over 3. 5 kb and is interrupted by the (CTG) n repeat. Comparison of genomic sequences downstream (centromeric) of the repeat in human and mouse identified regions of significant homology. These correspond to exons of a gene predicted to encode a homeodomain protein. RT-PCR analysis shows that this gene, which we have called DM locus-associated homeodomain protein (DMAHP), is expressed in a number of human tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart and brain.
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is associated with the expansion of a (CTG) n trinucleotide repeat in the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of the DM protein kinase gene (DMPK). The (CTG) n repeat is polymorphic and varies in size between 5 and 37 repeats in unaffected individuals whereas in affected patients there are between 50 and 4, 000 CTGs. The size of the (CTG) n repeat, which increases through generations, generally correlates with clinical severity and age of onset. The instability of the CTG repeat appears to depend on its size as well as on the sex of the transmitting parent. Moreover, mitotic instability analysis of different human DM tissues shows length mosaicism between different cell lineages. The molecular mechanisms of triplet instability remain elusive. To investigate the role of genomic sequences in instability, we produced transgenic mice containing a 45-kb genomic segment with a 55-CTG repeat cloned from a mildly affected patient. In contrast to other mouse models containing CAG repeats within cDNAs, these mice showed both intergenerational and somatic repeat instability..
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3 untranslated region of the DM gene. One model of DM pathogenesis suggests that RNAs from the expanded allele create a gain-of-function mutation by the inappropriate binding of proteins to the CUG repeats. Data presented here indicate that the conserved heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, CUG-binding protein (CUG-BP), may mediate the trans-dominant effect of the RNA. CUG-BP was found to bind to the human cardiac troponin T (cTNT) pre-messenger RNA and regulate its alternative splicing. Splicing of cTNT was disrupted in DM striated muscle and in normal cells expressing transcripts that contain CUG repeats. Altered expression of genes regulated posttranscriptionally by CUG-BP therefore may contribute to DM pathogenesis..
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3UTR of the DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene. A very high level of instability is observed through successive generations and the size of the repeat is generally correlated with the severity of the disease and with age at onset. Furthermore, tissues from DM patients exhibit somatic mosaicism that increases with age. We generated transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with 20, 55 or > 300 CTG, cloned from patients from the same affected DM family. Using large human flanking sequences and a large amplification, we demonstrate that the intergenerational CTG repeat instability is reproduced in mice, with a strong bias towards expansions and with the same sex- and size-dependent characteristics as in humans. Moreover, a high level of instability, increasing with age, can be observed in tissues and in sperm. Although we did not observe dramatic expansions (or big jumps over several hundred CTG repeats) as in congenital forms of DM, our model carrying > 300 CTG is the first to show instability so close to the human DM situation. Our three models carrying different sizes of CTG repeat provide insight on the different factors modulating the CTG repeat instability..
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by abnormal expansion of a polymorphic (CTG) n repeat, located in the DM protein kinase gene. We determined the (CTG) n repeat lengths in a broad range of tissue DNAs from patients with mild, classical, or congenital manifestation of DM. Differences in the repeat length were seen in somatic tissues from single DM individuals and twins. Repeats appeared to expand to a similar extent in tissues originating from the same embryonal origin. In most male patients carrying intermediate- or small-sized expansions in blood, the repeat lengths covered a markedly wider range in sperm. In contrast, male patients with large allele expansions in blood (> 700 CTGs) had similar or smaller repeats in sperm, when detectable. Sperm alleles with > 1, 000 CTGs were not seen. We conclude that DM patients can be considered gonosomal mosaics, i. e e., combined somatic and germ-line tissue mosaics. Most remarkably, we observed multiple cases where the length distributions of intermediate- or small-sized alleles in fathers sperm were significantly different from that in their offsprings blood. Our combined findings indicate that intergenerational length changes in the unstable CTG repeat are most likely to occur during early embryonic mitotic divisions in both somatic and germ-line tissue formation. Both the initial CTG length, the overall number of cell divisions involved in tissue formation, and perhaps a specific selection process in spermatogenesis may influence the dynamics of this process. A model explaining mitotic instability and sex-dependent segregation phenomena in DM manifestation is discussed
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is commonly associated with CTG repeat expansions within the gene for DM-protein kinase (DMPK). The effect of altered expression levels of DMPK, which is ubiquitously expressed in all muscle cell lineages during development, was examined by disrupting the endogenous Dmpk gene and overexpressing a normal human DMPK transgene in mice. Nullizygous (-/-) mice showed only inconsistent and minor size changes in head and neck muscle fibres at older age, animals with the highest DMPK transgene expression showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and enhanced neonatal mortality. However, both models lack other frequent DM symptoms including the fibre-type dependent atrophy, myotonia, cataract and male-infertility. These results strengthen the contention that simple loss- or gain-of-expression of DMPK is not the only crucial requirement for development of the disease..
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, with a prevalence of 2-14 per 100, 000 individuals. The disease is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and sustained muscle contraction, often with a wide range of accompanying symptoms. The age at onset and severity of the disease show extreme variation, both within and between families. Despite its clinical variability, this dominant condition segregates as a single locus at chromosome 19q13. 3 in every population studied. It is flanked by the tightly linked genetic markers ERCC1 proximally and D19S51 distally; these define the DM critical region. We report the isolation of an expressed sequence from this region which detects a DNA fragment that is larger in affected individuals than in normal siblings or unaffected controls. The size of this fragment varies between affected siblings, and increases in size through generations in parallel with increasing severity of the disease. We postulate that this unstable DNA sequence is the molecular feature that underlies DM.
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most prevalent inherited neuromuscular disease in adults. The genetic defect is a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the 3-untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene, consisting of 15 exons. Using a transgenic DMPK-overexpressor mouse model, we demonstrate here that the endogenous mouse DMPK gene and the human DMPK transgene produce six major alternatively spliced mRNAs which have almost identical cell type-dependent distribution frequencies and expression patterns. Use of a cryptic 5 splice site in exon 8, which results in absence or presence of 15 nucleotides specifying a VSGGG peptide motif, and/or use of a cryptic 3 splice site in exon 14, which leads to a frameshift in the mRNA reading frame, occur as independent stochastic events in all tissues examined. In contrast, the excision of exons 13/14 that causes a frameshift and creates a C-terminally truncated protein is clearly cell type dependent and occurs predominantly in smooth muscle. We generated all six full-length mouse cDNAs that result from combinations of these three major splicing events and show that their transfection into cells in culture leads to production of four different approximately 74 kDa full-length (heart-, skeletal muscle- or brain-specific) and two C-terminally truncated approximately 68 kDa (smooth muscle-specific) isoforms. Information on DMPK mRNA and protein isoform expression patterns will be useful for recognizing differential effects of (CTG) (n) expansion in DM manifestation..
Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adult humans, results from expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3 untranslated region of the DMPK gene. The mutant DMPK messenger RNA (mRNA) contains an expanded CUG repeat and is retained in the nucleus. We have expressed an untranslated CUG repeat in an unrelated mRNA in transgenic mice. Mice that expressed expanded CUG repeats developed myotonia and myopathy, whereas mice expressing a nonexpanded repeat did not. Thus, transcripts with expanded CUG repeats are sufficient to generate a DM phenotype. This result supports a role for RNA gain of function in disease pathogenesis..
Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most prevalent muscular disorder in adults, is caused by (CTG) n-repeat expansion in a gene encoding a protein kinase (DM protein kinase; DMPK) and involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis. To obtain clues to the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis, we have compared the resting [Ca2 +] i, the amplitude and shape of depolarization-induced Ca2 + transients, and the content of ATP-driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild-type and DMPK [-/-] knockout mice. In vitro-differentiated DMPK [-/-] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [Ca2 +] i than do wild-type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage-dependent l-type Ca2 + and Na + channels. The mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2 + responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external K +. In addition, we observed that these Ca2 + transients partially result from an influx of extracellular Ca2 + through the l-type Ca2 + channel. Neither the content nor the activity of Na +/K + ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase are affected by DMPK absence. In conclusion, our data suggest that DMPK is involved in modulating the initial events of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle..

Myotonic dystrophy, or dystrophia myotonica (DM), is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3 untranslated region of the DMPK protein kinase gene on chromosome 19q13. 3 (refs 1-3). Although the DM mutation was identified more than five years ago, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this most prevalent form of hereditary adult neuromuscular disease remain elusive. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that a DNase l-hypersensitive site located adjacent to the repeats on the wild-type allele is eliminated by repeat expansion, indicating that large CTG-repeat arrays may be associated with a local chromatin environment that represses gene expression. Here we report that the hypersensitive site contains an enhancer element that regulates transcription of the adjacent DMAHP homeobox gene. Analysis of DMAHP expression in the cells of DM patients with loss of the hypersensitive site revealed a two- to fourfold reduction in steady-state DMAHP transcript levels relative to wild-type controls. Allele-specific analysis of DMAHP expression showed that steady-state transcript levels from the expanded allele were greatly reduced in comparison to those from the wild-type allele. Together, these results demonstrate that CTG-repeat expansions can suppress local gene expression and implicate DMAHP in DM pathogenesis.

Myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma (MIFS) is a rare, low-grade sarcoma characterized by distinctive, large, and bizarre Reed--Sternberg--like cells associated with an intense inflammatory infiltrate. The biology of MIFS is still poorly understood, and only two previous cases had been studied cytogenetically. In the present case, analysis of MIFS in the foot of a 53-year-old man revealed the chromosome translocation t(2;6)(q31;p21.3) as the only cytogenetic abnormality. This finding is distinct from the two cases previously reported. Additional studies are needed to verify whether any of these chromosome rearrangements are involved recurrently in MIFS.

NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain can be fragmented in a flavoprotein (FP), iron-sulfur protein (IP), and hydrophobic protein (HP) subfraction. The IP subfraction is hypothesized to be significant, since it contains important prosthetic groups highly conserved among species. We cloned the cDNA of three remaining human NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits of this IP fraction: the NDUFS2 (49 kDa), NDUFS3 (30 kDa), and NDUFS6 (13 kDa) subunits. All presented cDNAs include the complete open reading frame (ORF), which consist of 1392, 795, and 375 base pairs, coding for 463, 264, and 124 amino acids, respectively. The latter show 96, 90, and 83% homology with the corresponding bovine translation products. The 3' untranslated regions (UTR) are complete in all three cDNAs. Polymerase chain reaction performed with DNA isolated from somatic human-rodent cell hybrids containing defined human chromosomes as template gave a human-specific signal which mapped the NDUFS2 and NDUFS3 subunits to chromosomes 1 and 11, respectively. In the case of the NDUFS6 subunit a pseudogene may be present since signals were seen in the lanes containing chromosomes 5 and 6. The NDUFS2 contains a highly conserved protein kinase C phosphorylation site and the NDUFS3 subunit contains a highly conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site which make them strong candidates for future mutation detection studies in enzymatic complex I-deficient patients.

NRA0160, 5 - [2- ( 4- ( 3 - fluorobenzylidene) piperidin-1-yl) ethyl] - 4 -(4-fluorophenyl) thiazole-2-carboxamide, has a high affinity for human cloned dopamine D4.2, D4.4 and D4.7 receptors, with Ki values of 0.5, 0.9 and 2.7 nM, respectively. NRA0160 is over 20,000fold more potent at the dopamine D4.2 receptor compared with the human cloned dopamine D2L receptor. NRA0160 has negligible affinity for the human cloned dopamine D3 receptor (Ki=39 nM), rat serotonin (5-HT)2A receptors (Ki=180 nM) and rat alpha1 adrenoceptor (Ki=237 nM). NRA0160 and clozapine antagonized locomotor hyperactivity induced by methamphetamine (MAP) in mice. NRA0160 and clozapine antagonized MAP-induced stereotyped behavior in mice, although their effects did not exceed 50% inhibition, even at the highest dose given. NRA0160 and clozapine significantly induced catalepsy in rats, although their effects did not exceed 50% induction even at the highest dose given. NRA0160 and clozapine significantly reversed the disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in rats produced by apomorphine. NRA0160 and clozapine significantly shortened the phencyclidine (PCP)-induced prolonged swimming latency in rats in a water maze task. These findings suggest that NRA0160 may have unique antipsychotic activities without the liability of motor side effects typical of classical antipsychotics.
NS-718, a lipid nanosphere incorporating amphotericin B, is effective against pathogenic fungi and has low toxicity. We compared the toxicity of NS-718 with that of Fungizone (amphotericin B-sodium deoxycholate; D-AmB) in vitro using renal cell cultures and in vivo by biochemical analysis, histopathological study of the kidney and pharmacokinetic study of amphotericin B following intravenous infusion of the formulation in rats. Incubation with NS-718 resulted in significantly less damage of cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells compared with D-AmB. Serum blood urea and creatinine concentrations increased significantly in rats given an iv infusion of D-AmB 3 mg/kg but not in those given the same dose of NS-718. Histopathological examination of the kidney showed tubular necrosis in D-AmB-treated rats but no change in NS-718-treated rats. Amphotericin B concentrations in the kidney in NS-718-treated rats were higher than those in D-AmB-treated rats. Our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that incorporation of amphotericin B into lipid nanospheres of NS-718 attenuates the nephrotoxicity of amphotericin B.

Natural endogenous antisense RNAs have been reported in multiple loci, with evidence in some cases supporting a regulatory role for the antisense transcript. Here, we describe a novel gene, makorin RING zinc finger-2 (MKRN2), that overlaps and is antisense to the gene RAF1 in mammals. Phylogenetic analysis of the 3' untranslated region of RAF1 orthologues suggests that this relationship may have existed for up to 450 million years. We have also identified MKRN2 orthologues in two species of fish. This places the gene duplication event that created this locus from an ancestral MKRN1 gene early in vertebrate evolution, over 450 million years ago. Northern blot analyses show that human MKRN2 and RAF1 are co-expressed in tissues and cell lines, raising the possibility of mRNA duplex formation. The encoded makorin-2 protein is likely a ribonucleoprotein of unknown function, but its conservation suggests an important cellular role. The data presented here describe a conserved vertebrate MKRN2 gene that is closely associated with the RAF1 locus.

Nature, time course and dose dependence of zidovudine-related side effects: results from the Multicenter Canadian Azidothymidine Trial.
Nearly 3.2 million people in this country receive aminoglycoside antibiotics annually. Gentamicin sulfate and tobramycin sulfate continue to demonstrate ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity in both animal and clinical studies. In this study, 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg/kg/day of gentamicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of aminoglycoside-related renal failure, defined as at least a one-third reduction in renal function. In these 62 patients, no other causes for renal failure could be identified. Five of 33 (15%) of the tobramycin-treated patients and 16 of 29 (55.2%) of the gentamicin-treated patients had renal failure. Thus, gentamicin was associated with renal failure more than three times as often as was tobramycin.

Nefiracetam (DM-9384) reverses apomorphine-induced amnesia of a passive avoidance response: delayed emergence of the memory retention effects.
Nefiracetam is a novel pyrrolidone derivative which attenuates scopolamine-induced learning and post-training consolidation deficits. Given that apomorphine inhibits passive avoidance retention when given during training or in a defined 10-12h post-training period, we evaluated the ability of nefiracetam to attenuate amnesia induced by dopaminergic agonism. A step-down passive avoidance paradigm was employed and nefiracetam (3 mg/kg) and apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg) were given alone or in combination during training and at the 10-12h post-training period of consolidation. Co-administration of nefiracetam and apomorphine during training or 10h thereafter produced no significant anti-amnesic effect. However, administration of nefiracetam during training completely reversed the amnesia induced by apomorphine at the 10h post-training time and the converse was also true. These effects were not mediated by a dopaminergic mechanism as nefiracetam, at millimolar concentrations, failed to displace either [3H]SCH 23390 or [3H]spiperone binding from D1 or D2 dopamine receptor subtypes, respectively. It is suggested that nefiracetam augments molecular processes in the early stages of events which ultimately lead to consolidation of memory.

Nephropathy in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
Nephropathy was detected in five of 32 patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome who were participating in a study of transfer factor (TF) therapy. In two patients, nephropathy was present before TF and did not appear changed by TF therapy. One of these patients subsequently developed progressive renal failure requiring dialysis beginning 5 1/2 years after TF therapy. In two patients, decreased renal function appeared very soon after the administration of TF. One patient showed gradually decreasing renal function beginning after two years of TF therapy. An additional patient was identified who died with renal failure without having received TF. The results suggest that renal failure occurs in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome more frequently than generally recognized and that administration of TF may precipitate or accelerate the renal disease in patients with this syndrome..
Nephrotic syndrome is often accompanied by sodium retention and generalized edema. However, the molecular basis for the decreased renal sodium excretion remains undefined. We hypothesized that epithelial Na channel (ENaC) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased sodium retention. An experimental group of rats was treated with puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN; 180 mg/kg iv), whereas the control group received only vehicle. After 7 days, PAN treatment induced significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, decreased urinary sodium excretion, and extensive ascites. The protein abundance of alpha-ENaC and beta-ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM) and in the inner medulla (IM) but was not altered in the cortex. gamma-ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex, ISOM, and IM. Immunoperoxidase brightfield- and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha-ENaC, beta-ENaC, and gamma-ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), connecting tubule, and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments. Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha-ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of PAN-treated rats, indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha-ENaC subunits. In contrast, the protein abundances of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3 (NHE3), Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (BSC-1), and thiazide-sensitive Na(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (TSC) were decreased. Moreover, the abundance of the alpha(1)-subunit of the Na-K-ATPase was decreased in the cortex and ISOM, but it remained unchanged in the IM. In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with PAN-induced nephrotic syndrome. The decreased abundance of NHE3, BSC-1, TSC, and Na-K-ATPase may play a compensatory role to promote sodium excretion.
Nephrotoxic effects in high-risk patients undergoing angiography.
Nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycoside treatment on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation.
Nephrotoxicity associated with ciprofloxacin is uncommon. Five patients with cancer who developed acute renal failure that followed treatment with ciprofloxacin are described and an additional 15 cases reported in the literature are reviewed. Other than elevation of serum creatinine levels, characteristic clinical manifestations and abnormal laboratory findings are not frequently present. Allergic interstitial nephritis is believed to be the underlying pathological-process. Definitive diagnosis requires performance of renal biopsy, although this is not always feasible. An improvement in renal function that followed the discontinuation of the offending antibiotic supports the presumptive diagnosis of ciprofloxacin-induced acute renal failure.

Nerve growth factor (NGF) is thought to have a profound effect on the development and maintenance of sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurones (see refs 1-3 for review). NGF activity isolated from the male mouse submaxillary gland (MSG) consists of three types of subunits, alpha, beta and gamma, which specifically interact to form a 7S, approximately 130,000-molecular weight (Mr) complex. The 7S complex contains two identical 118-amino acid beta-chains, which are solely responsible for the nerve growth-stimulating activity of NGF. While NGF is found in almost all vertebrates, most research has focused on murine NGF, as the mouse male submaxillary gland contains higher levels of this polypeptide than other tissues. Even so, beta-NGF comprises only approximately 0.1% of the protein in this small gland, which has made the study of this polypeptide difficult. The amino acid sequence of the mouse NGF beta-chain has been determined and some information has been obtained regarding the size of a mouse precursor molecule, pro-beta-NGF, but little was known about the structure and relatedness of beta-NGF from other vertebrates. Here we describe the isolation of mouse beta-NGF complementary DNA (cDNA) and present its nucleotide sequence, which predicts a prepro-beta-NGF molecule of Mr 27,000 (27K) and a pro-beta-NGF molecule of Mr 25K. We have used the mouse beta-NGF cDNA clone to isolate the human beta-NGF gene, the coding regions of which are highly homologous to the mouse prepro-beta-NGF nucleotide and amino acid sequences.
Nerve growth factor and prostaglandins in the urine of female patients with overactive bladder.
Netrin-G1 is a lipid-anchored protein that is structurally related to the netrin family of axon guidance molecules. Netrin-G1 does not bind any of the known netrin receptors and its function is not known. Here we identify human netrin-G1 ligand (NGL-1), a transmembrane protein containing leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) domains that specifically interacts with netrin-G1 through its LRR region. Whereas netrin-G1 is expressed highly in mouse thalamic axons, NGL-1 is most abundant in the striatum and the cerebral cortex--the intermediate and final targets, respectively, of thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Surface-bound NGL-1 stimulates, but soluble NGL-1 disrupts, the growth of embryonic thalamic axons, and in vitro data indicate that NGL-1 activity may be mediated at least partially by netrin-G1. Our findings provide evidence that netrin-G1 functions as an important component of the NGL-1 receptor to promote TCA outgrowth and that membrane-bound netrins can participate in receiving axonal signaling pathways.
Neural correlates of S-ketamine induced psychosis during overt continuous verbal fluency.
Neuroactive steroids demonstrate pharmacological actions that have relevance for a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders. They offer protection against seizures in a range of models and seem to inhibit certain stages of drug dependence in preclinical assessments. The present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive steroid that positively modulate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor against the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of cocaine engendered by repeated cocaine administration (seizure kindling). Allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one), pregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one) and ganaxolone (a synthetic derivative of allopregnanolone 3alpha-hydroxy-3beta-methyl-5alpha-pregnan-20-one) were tested for their ability to suppress the expression (anticonvulsant effect) and development (antiepileptogenic effect) of cocaine-kindled seizures in male, Swiss-Webster mice. Kindled seizures were induced by daily administration of 60 mg/kg cocaine for 5 days. All of these positive GABA(A) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled seizures, whereas only allopregnanolone and ganaxolone inhibited the development of kindling. Allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, but not ganaxolone, also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling. These findings demonstrate that some neuroactive steroids attenuate convulsant and sensitizing properties of cocaine and add to a growing literature on their potential use in the modulation of effects of drugs of abuse.

Neurofascin belongs to the L1 subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules and is implicated in axonal growth and fasciculation. We used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify proteins that interact with neurofascin intracellularly and therefore might link it to trafficking, spatial targeting, or signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that rat syntenin-1, previously published as syntenin, mda-9, or TACIP18 in human, is a neurofascin-binding protein that exhibits a wide-spread tissue expression pattern with a relative maximum in brain. Syntenin-1 was found not to interact with other vertebrate members of the L1 subgroup such as L1 itself or NrCAM. We confirmed the specificity of the neurofascin-syntenin-1 interaction by ligand-overlay assay, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and colocalization of both proteins in heterologous cells. The COOH terminus of neurofascin was mapped to interact with the second PDZ domain of syntenin-1. Furthermore, we isolated syntenin-2 that may be expressed in two isoforms. Despite their high sequence similarity to syntenin-1, syntenin-2alpha, which interacts with neurexin I, and syntenin-2beta do not bind to neurofascin or several other transmembrane proteins that are binding partners of syntenin-1. Finally, we report that syntenin-1 and -2 both form homodimers and can interact with each other.
Neuroinflammation and behavioral abnormalities after neonatal terbutaline treatment in rats: implications for autism.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is the rarest and most serious of the neuroleptic-induced movement disorders. We describe a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) associated with the use of ziprasidone. Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with NMS, atypical antipsychotic drugs like ziprasidone may also be a cause. The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who developed signs and symptoms of NMS after 2 days of treatment with an 80-mg/day dose of orally administrated ziprasidone. This case is the earliest (second day of treatment) NMS due to ziprasidone reported in the literature.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is thought to be a result of dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia. Risperidone, a benzisoxazole derivative antipsychotic, has high serotonin 5-HT2 receptor blockade and dose-related D2 receptor blockade. The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone at low dosages. With this low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms, it was thought the frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome might also be lowered. A 73-year-old woman developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome after monotherapy with risperidone. The syndrome reversed after discontinuing risperidone and starting treatment with dantrolene and bromocriptine. It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with risperidone does not ensure protection from neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

Neurological complications after renal transplantation constitute an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Their differential diagnosis is difficult and essential for subsequent patient's management. Valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy is an uncommon but serious effect of valproate treatment. Here, we describe the case of a 15-year-old girl who was on a long-term therapy with valproate due to epilepsy and revealed impaired consciousness with hyperammonemia 12 days after renal transplantation. After withdraw of valproate, patients' symptoms resolved within 24 h. Clinicians should increase their awareness for potential complication of valproate, especially in transplanted patients.
Neuromuscular blockade with magnesium sulfate and nifedipine.
Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are often used for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Reports of persistent paralysis after the discontinuance of these drugs have most often involved aminosteroid-based NMBAs such as vecuronium bromide, especially when used in conjunction with corticosteroids. Atracurium besylate, a short-acting benzylisoquinolinium NMBA that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function, has also been associated with persistent paralysis, but only when used with corticosteroids. We report a case of atracurium-related paralysis persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids.
Neuronal development and apoptosis critically depend on the transformation of extracellular signals to intracellular actions resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangements. Ena/VASP (enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) proteins play an important role in actin and filament dynamics, whereas members of the semaphorin protein family are guidance signals in embryo- and organogenesis. Here, we report the identification of two novel transmembranous human and murine semaphorins, (HSA)SEMA6A-1 and (MMU)Sema6A-1. These semaphorin 6 variants directly link the Ena/VASP and the semaphorin protein family, since SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is capable of a selective binding to the protein EVL (Ena/VASP-like protein). EVL is the third member of the Ena/VASP family of proteins that was identified sharing the same structural features as Mena (mammalian enabled) and VASP, although its functionality seems to be different from that of the other members. Here we demonstrate that SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is colocalized with EVL via its zyxin-like carboxyl-terminal domain that contains a modified binding motif, which further stresses the existence of functional differences between EVL and Mena/VASP. In addition these findings suggest a completely new role for transmembranous semaphorins such as SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 in retrograde signaling.
Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) is expressed by granule cells and mossy fibres of the hippocampal dentate gyrus during experimental temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block seizure-like events following high-frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices. The pilocarpine (PILO) model of epilepsy is characterized by an acute period of status epilepticus followed by spontaneous recurrent seizures and related brain damage. We report peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunostaining for NPY in several brain regions in this model. PILO-injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals, in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and, in a few cases, within presumed granule cells. NPY immunoreactivity was also dramatically changed in the entorhinal cortex, amygdala and sensorimotor areas. In addition, PILO injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY-immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls. The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression, including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons, are present in the PILO model of TLE. However, the significance of this changed synthesis of NPY remains to be determined.

Neutrophil and monocyte differentiation can be induced in HL60 leukaemia cells by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3), respectively, whose differentiating effects can be enhanced by exposure to 'anti-inflammatory agents' and steroids. We have provided evidence that this potentiation is via inhibition of the activity of an enzyme of the aldoketoreductase (AKR) family, but had failed to identify expression of known AKRs in HL60 cells. In this study, we have identified a previously unclassified aldoketoreductase family member (termed HAKR e) that is expressed in HL60 cells. HAKR e is dramatically and transiently up-regulated in HL60 cells within 24 h of exposure to ATRA, further supporting the proposition that a member(s) of this family of enzymes play(s) a role in controlling cell growth and/or differentiation.

Niacin extended-release/lovastatin is a new combination product approved for treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. This open-labeled, multicenter study evaluated the safety of bedtime niacin extended-release/lovastatin when dosed as initial therapy and patient compliance to treatment in various clinical practice settings. A total of 4,499 patients with dyslipidemia requiring drug intervention was enrolled at 1,081 sites. Patients were treated with 1 tablet (500 mg of niacin extended-release/20 mg of lovastatin) once nightly for 4 weeks and then 2 tablets for 8 weeks. Patients also received dietary counseling, educational materials, and reminders to call a toll-free number that provided further education about dyslipidemia and niacin extended-release/lovastatin. Primary end points were study compliance, increases in liver transaminases to >3 times the upper limit of normal, and clinical myopathy. Final study status was available for 4,217 patients (94%). Compliance to niacin extended-release/lovastatin was 77%, with 3,245 patients completing the study. Patients in the southeast and those enrolled by endocrinologists had the lowest compliance and highest adverse event rates. Flushing was the most common adverse event, reported by 18% of patients and leading to discontinuation by 6%. Incidence of increased aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase >3 times the upper limit of normal was <0.3%. An increase of creatine phosphokinase to >5 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0.24% of patients, and no cases of drug-induced myopathy were observed. Niacin extended-release/lovastatin 1,000/40 mg, dosed as initial therapy, was associated with good compliance and safety and had very low incidences of increased liver and muscle enzymes.
Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) catalyzes the N-methylation of nicotinamide and other pyridines. Human liver NNMT activity has a bimodal frequency distribution, an observation which raises the possibility that this enzyme activity might be regulated by a genetic polymorphism, a polymorphism that could have functional implications for individual differences in drug and xenobiotic toxicity. As a first step toward testing that hypothesis, we set out to clone and express a cDNA for human liver NNMT. Human liver NNMT was partially purified, photoaffinity-labeled, subjected to limited proteolysis, and partial amino acid sequence information was obtained. The polymerase chain reaction was then used to amplify a 550-nucleotide sequence with human liver cDNA as template and primers designed on the basis of the NNMT amino acid sequence. The 5'- and 3'-ends of a human liver NNMT cDNA were obtained by use of the rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The combined use of these approaches resulted in the isolation of a human liver NNMT cDNA that was 969 nucleotides in length, with a 792-nucleotide open reading frame that encoded a 264-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 29.6 kDa. The human liver NNMT cDNA was transcribed in vitro and translated with a reticulocyte lysate system to yield a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 29 kDa that comigrated during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with photoaffinity-labeled human liver NNMT. The NNMT cDNA was also subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector p91023(B). COS-1 cells transfected with this construct expressed a high level of NNMT enzymatic activity, and the biochemical properties of this activity were similar to those of human liver NNMT. Human liver NNMT and transfected COS-1 cell NNMT had apparent Km values for the two cosubstrates for the reaction, nicotinamide and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, of 0.43 and 0.38 mM and of 1.8 and 2.2 microM, respectively. IC50 values for the inhibition of NNMT by N1-methylnicotinamide were 60 and 30 microns for human liver and COS-1 cell-expressed NNMT, respectively. Cloning of a cDNA for human liver NNMT will help make it possible to test the hypothesis that inheritance may play a role in the regulation of individual differences in human liver NNMT activity.
Nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular disease. Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis, but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect. Almost certainly, nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events, although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide. Nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among humans. Clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events. Finally, the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat, suggesting that if nicotine is involved, adverse effects might be seen with relatively low-level cigarette exposures.

Nine different germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene were identified in 15 of 47 kindreds from southern Sweden, by use of SSCP and heteroduplex analysis of all exons and flanking intron region and by a protein-truncation test for exon 11, followed by direct sequencing. All but one of the mutations are predicted to give rise to premature translation termination and include seven frameshift insertions or deletions, a nonsense mutation, and a splice acceptor site mutation. The remaining mutation is a missense mutation (Cys61Gly) in the zinc-binding motif. Four novel Swedish founding mutations were identified the nucleotide 2595 deletion A was found in five families, the C 1806 T nonsense mutation in three families, the 3166 insertion TGAGA in three families, and the nucleotide 1201 deletion 11 in two families. Analysis of the intragenic polymorphism D17S855 supports common origins of the mutations. Eleven of the 15 kindreds manifesting BRCA1 mutations were breast-ovarian cancer families, several of them with a predominant ovarian cancer phenotype. The set of 32 families in which no BRCA1 alterations were detected included 1 breast-ovarian cancer kindred manifesting clear linkage to the BRCA1 region and loss of the wild-type chromosome in associated tumors. Other tumor types found in BRCA1 mutation/haplotype carriers included prostatic, pancreas, skin, and lung cancer, a malignant melanoma, an oligodendroglioma, and a carcinosarcoma. In all, 12 of 16 kindreds manifesting BRCA1 mutation or linkage contained ovarian cancer, as compared with only 6 of the remaining 31 families (P <. 001). The present study confirms the involvement of BRCA1 in disease predisposition for a subset of hereditary breast cancer families often characterized by ovarian cancers.

Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester: a potential protector against gentamicin ototoxicity.
Nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce ST-segment elevation during acute myocardial infarction, an effect potentiated in the dog by agents that reverse nitroglycerin-induced hypotension. Our study was designed to determine the effects of combined nitroglycerin and phenylephrine therapy. Ten patients with acute transmural myocardial infarctions received intravenous nitroglycerin, sufficient to reduce mean arterial pressure from 107 +/- 6 to 85 +/- 6 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), for 60 minutes. Left ventricular filling pressure decreased from 19 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). SigmaST, the sum of ST-segment elevations in 16 precordial leads, decreased (P less than 0.02) with intravenous nitroglycerin. Subsequent addition of phenylephrine infusion, sufficient to re-elevate mean arterial pressure to 106 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) for 30 minutes, increased left ventricular filling pressure to 17 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) and also significantly increased sigmaST (P less than 0.05). Our results suggest that addition of phenylephrine to nitroglycerin is not beneficial in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction.
Nitroprusside-induced hypotension evokes ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor (irCRF) into the hypophysial-portal circulation. Portal plasma concentrations of neither arginine vasopressin nor oxytocin are significantly altered in this paradigm. Application of a delayed feedback signal, in the form of a 2-h systemic corticosterone infusion in urethane-anesthetized rats with pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis, is without effect on the resting secretion of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin at any corticosterone feedback dose tested. Resting irCRF levels are suppressed only at the highest corticosterone infusion rate, which resulted in systemic corticosterone levels of 40 micrograms/dl. Suppression of irCRF secretion in response to nitroprusside-induced hypotension is observed and occurs at a plasma corticosterone level between 8-12 micrograms/dl. These studies provide further evidence for a strong central component of the delayed feedback process which is mediated by modulation of irCRF release.
Nkx6-2 (former Gtx) is a murine-homeobox-containing gene localized distally on Chromosome (Chr) 7. Analysis of the expression pattern, together with DNA binding assays, suggests that this gene product might be important for differentiated oligodendrocyte function and in the regulation of myelin gene expression. We now report on the cloning and characterization of the human homolog (NKX6B). DNA sequence analysis of an 11-kb genomic fragment revealed that the complete human gene spans 1.2 kb and is composed of three exons. NKX6B is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 277 amino acids with 97% identity to mouse Nkx6-2. Northern blot experiments showed that NKX6B expression is tightly controlled in a tissue-specific fashion with the highest site of expression being the brain. Finally, using STS content mapping and RH analyis, we demonstrated that NKX6B maps to the 10q26, a region where frequent loss of heterozygosity has been observed in various malignant brain tumors. These results may implicate NKX6B as a candidate tumor suppressor gene for brain tumors, particularly for oligodendrogliomas.
No agent is yet available to reverse respiratory paralysis produced by CNS depressants, such as general anesthetics. In this study naloxone reversed respiratory paralysis induced by thiopental in rats. 25 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate, increased GABA, decreased glutamate, and had no effect on aspartate or glycine levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem. Pretreatment of rats with thiosemicarbazide for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of thiopental. 50 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced respiratory arrest with further increase in GABA and decrease in glutamate again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the amino acids studied in four regions of rat brain. Naloxone (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed respiratory paralysis, glutamate and GABA levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum. These data suggest naloxone reverses respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental and involves GABA in its action.

Non-syndromic deafness is genetically heterogeneous. We previously reported that mutations of transmembrane channel-like gene 1 (TMC1) cause non-syndromic recessive deafness at the DFNB7/B11 locus on chromosome 9q13-q21 in nine Pakistani families. The goal of this study was to define the identities, origins and frequencies of TMC1 mutations in an expanded cohort of 557 large Pakistani families segregating recessive deafness. We screened affected family members for homozygosity at short-tandem repeats flanking known autosomal recessive (DFNB) deafness loci, followed by TMC1 sequence analysis in families segregating deafness linked to DFNB7/B11. We identified 10 new families segregating DFNB7/B11 deafness and TMC1 mutations, including three novel alleles. Overall, 9 different TMC1 mutations account for deafness in 19 (3.4%) of the 557 Pakistani families. A single mutation, p.R34X, causes deafness in 10 (1.8%) of the families. Genotype analysis of p.R34X-linked markers indicates that it arose from a common founder. We also detected p.R34X among normal control samples of African-American and northern European origins, raising the possibility that p.R34X and other mutations of TMC1 are prevalent contributors to the genetic load of deafness across a variety of populations and continents.

Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a disorder of amino acid metabolism in which a defect in the glycine cleavage system leads to an accumulation of glycine in the brain and other body compartments. In the classical form it presents as neonatal apnea, intractable seizures, and hypotonia, followed by significant psychomotor retardation. An important subset of children with nonketotic hyperglycinemia are atypical variants who present in a heterogeneous manner. This report describes a patient with mild language delay and mental retardation, who was found to have nonketotic hyperglycinemia following her presentation with acute encephalopathy and chorea shortly after initiation of valproate therapy.

Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) rids eukaryotic cells of aberrant mRNAs containing premature termination codons. These are discriminated from true termination codons by downstream cis-elements, such as exon-exon junctions. We describe three novel human proteins involved in NMD, hUpf2, hUpf3a, and hUpf3b. While in HeLa cell extracts these proteins are complexed with hUpf1, in intact cells hUpf3a and hUpf3b are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins, hUpf2 is perinuclear, and hUpf1 cytoplasmic. hUpf3a and hUpf3b associate selectively with spliced beta-globin mRNA in vivo, and tethering of any hUpf protein to the 3'UTR of beta-globin mRNA elicits NMD. These data suggest that assembly of a dynamic hUpf complex initiates in the nucleus at mRNA exon-exon junctions and triggers NMD in the cytoplasm when recognized downstream of a translation termination site.

Normoammonemic encephalopathy: solely valproate induced or multiple mechanisms?
Normotriglyceridemic abetalipoproteinemia is a rare familial disorder characterized by an isolated deficiency of apoB-100. We have previously reported a patient with this disease, who had normal apoB-48 but no apoB-100. To elucidate the genetic abnormalities in this family, we studied the linkage of apoB gene using three genetic markers. The proband and her affected brother showed completely different apoB gene alleles, suggesting that the apoB gene itself is not related to this disorder in this family. By contrast, an American case had a point substitution in the apoB gene generating an in-frame stop codon. These results indicate that this disorder can be caused by defect (s) of either an apoB gene or other genes..

Norrie disease is a human X-linked recessive disorder of unknown etiology characterized by congenital blindness, sensory neural deafness and mental retardation. This disease gene was previously linked to the DXS7 (L1. 28) locus and the MAO genes in band Xp11. 3 3. We report here fine physical mapping of the obligate region containing the Norrie disease gene (NDP) defined by a recombination and by the smallest submicroscopic chromosomal deletion associated with Norrie disease identified to date. Analysis, using in addition two overlapping YAC clones from this region, allowed orientation of the MAOA and MAOB genes in a 5-3-3-5 configuration. A recombination event between a (GT) n polymorphism in intron 2 of the MAOB gene and the NDP locus, in a family previously reported to have a recombination between DXS7 and NDP, delineates a flanking marker telomeric to this disease gene. An anonymous DNA probe, dc12, present in one of the YACs and in a patient with a submicroscopic deletion which includes MAOA and MAOB but not L1. 28, serves as a flanking marker centromeric to the disease gene. An Alu-PCR fragment from the right arm of the MAO YAC (YMAO. AluR) is not deleted in this patient and also delineates the centromeric extent of the obligate disease region. The apparent order of these loci is telomere. DXS7-MAOA-MAOB-NDP-dc12-YMAO DXS7-MAOA-MAOB-NDP-dc12-YMAO. AluR. centromere. Together these data define the obligate region containing the NDP gene to a chromosomal segment less than 150 kb.

Nuclear mRNA export mediated by the human protein TAP requires a carboxy-terminal domain that directly interacts with components of the nuclear pore complex. Here we demonstrate that NXF3, a human RNA binding protein related to TAP, lacks this domain yet retains the ability to export tethered RNA transcripts and to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. NXF3 contains a novel Crm1-dependent nuclear export signal that compensates in cis for the loss of the nuclear pore targeting domain. NXF3-dependent RNA export is therefore blocked by Crm1-specific inhibitors that do not affect TAP function. Thus, while the related TAP and NXF3 proteins are both capable of mediating nuclear RNA export, they do so via unrelated export pathways.
Nuclear receptors modulate the transcription of genes in direct response to small lipophilic ligands. Binding to ligands induces conformational changes in the nuclear receptors that enable the receptors to interact with several types of cofactor that are critical for transcription activation (transactivation). We previously described a distinct set of ligand-dependent proteins called DRIPs, which interact with the vitamin D receptor (VDR); together, these proteins constitute a new cofactor complex. DRIPs bind to several nuclear receptors and mediate ligand-dependent enhancement of transcription by VDR and the thyroid-hormone receptor in cell-free transcription assays. Here we report the identities of thirteen DRIPs that constitute this complex, and show that the complex has a central function in hormone-dependent transactivation by VDR on chromatin templates. The DRIPs are almost indistinguishable from components of another new cofactor complex called ARC, which is recruited by other types of transcription activators to mediate transactivation on chromatin-assembled templates. Several DRIP/ARC subunits are also components of other potentially related cofactors, such as CRSP, NAT, SMCC and the mouse Mediator, indicating that unique classes of activators may share common sets or subsets of cofactors. The role of nuclear-receptor ligands may, in part, be to recruit such a cofactor complex to the receptor and, in doing so, to enhance transcription of target genes.
Nucleotide excision repair is a highly versatile DNA repair system responsible for elimination of a wide variety of lesions from the genome. It is comprised of two subpathways: transcription-coupled repair that accomplishes efficient removal of damage blocking transcription and global genome repair. Recently, the basic mechanism of global genome repair has emerged from biochemical studies. However, little is known about transcription-coupled repair in eukaryotes. Here we report the identification of a novel protein designated XAB2 (XPA-binding protein 2) that was identified by virtue of its ability to interact with XPA, a factor central to both nucleotide excision repair subpathways. The XAB2 protein of 855 amino acids consists mainly of 15 tetratricopeptide repeats. In addition to interacting with XPA, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that a fraction of XAB2 is able to interact with the transcription-coupled repair-specific proteins CSA and CSB as well as RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, antibodies against XAB2 inhibited both transcription-coupled repair and transcription in vivo but not global genome repair when microinjected into living fibroblasts. These results indicate that XAB2 is a novel component involved in transcription-coupled repair and transcription.
Null mutation of the murine ATP7B (Wilson disease) gene results in intracellular copper accumulation and late-onset hepatic nodular transformation.
Numerous evidence indicates that some of the activities of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) depend on an intracrine mode of action. Recently, we showed that three high molecular mass (HMM) nuclear forms of FGF-2 are part of a 320-kDa protein complex while the cytoplasmic AUG-initiated form is included in a 130-kDa complex. Consequently, the characterization of FGF endogenous targets has become crucial to allow the elucidation of their endogenous activities. Through the screening of GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid expression libraries, we have isolated a gene encoding a nuclear protein of 55 kDa, FIF (FGF-2-interacting-factor), which interacts specifically with FGF-2 but not with FGF-1, FGF-3, or FGF-6. In this system, FIF interacts equally well with the NH2-extended 24-kDa FGF form as with the 18-kDa form, indicating that the FIF-binding motif is located in the last 155 amino acids of FGF-2. Nevertheless, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed an exclusive association with HMM FGF-2. The predicted protein contains a canonical leucine zipper domain and three overlapping hydrophobic heptad repeats. The region spanning these repeats is, together with a region located in the N-terminal part of the FIF protein, implicated in the binding to FGF-2. In contrast to the full-length FIF protein, several deletion constructs were able to transactivate a lac-Z reporter gene. Furthermore, the COOH-terminal part, but not the full-length FIF protein, has previously been shown to exhibit antiapoptotic properties. Thus we discuss the possibility that these activities could reflect a physiological function of FIF through its interaction with FGF-2.
OBJECTIVE Previous reports have suggested an increased risk of cancer among patients with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH). This study was carried out to further evaluate this risk among patients with CHH and their first-degree relatives. STUDY DESIGN One hundred twenty-two patients with CHH were identified through 2 countrywide epidemiologic surveys in 1974 and in 1986. Their parents and nonaffected siblings were identified through the Population Register Center. This cohort underwent follow-up for cancer incidence through the Finnish Cancer Registry to the end of 1995. RESULTS A statistically significant excess risk of cancer was seen among the patients with CHH (standardized incidence ratio 6. 9, 95% confidence interval 2. 3 to 16), which was mainly attributable to non-Hodgkins lymphoma (standardized incidence ratio 90, 95% confidence interval 18 to 264). In addition, a significant excess risk of basal cell carcinoma was seen (standardized incidence ratio 35, 95% confidence interval 7. 2 to 102). The cancer incidence among the siblings or the parents did not differ from the average cancer incidence in the Finnish population. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms an increased risk of cancer, especially non-Hodgkins lymphoma, probably attributable to defective immunity, among patients with CHH.
OBJECTIVE To define the mutation causing galactosemia in patients of black American origin who have no galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) activity in erythrocytes but good clinical outcome. METHODS We discovered a mutation caused by a C-- > T transition at base-pair 1158 of the GALT gene that results in a serine-to-leucine substitution at codon 135 (S135L). We developed a method with which to screen populations for its prevalence. We compared galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase among erythrocytes, leukocytes, and transformed lymphoblasts, as well as total body oxidation of D- (13C) -galactose to 13CO2 among three genotypes for GALT (S135L/S135L, Q188R/Q188R, and Normal/Normal). RESULTS We found a 48% prevalence of the S135L mutation among 17 black American patients with classic galactosemia and a 1% prevalence in a population of 50 black Americans without galactosemia. The S135L mutation was not found in 84 white patients with G/G galactosemia nor in 87 white control subjects without galactosemia. We found normal whole body oxidation of D- (13C) -galactose by the patient homozygous for S135L and various degrees of enzyme impairment among different tissues. CONCLUSIONS The S135L mutation in the GALT gene is a prevalent cause of galactosemia among black patients. Because GALT activity varies in different tissues of patients homozygous for S135L, they may have a better clinical outcome than patients who are homozygous for Q188R when both are treated from infancy..
OBJECTIVE To determine the relative effects of genetic and environmental factors in susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS Twins with AS were identified from the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases database. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed to establish diagnoses, and disease severity was assessed using a combination of validated scoring systems. HLA typing for HLA-B27, HLA-B60, and HLA-DR1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers, and zygosity was assessed using microsatellite markers. Genetic and environmental variance components were assessed with the program Mx, using data from this and previous studies of twins with AS. RESULTS Six of 8 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs were disease concordant, compared with 4 of 15 B27-positive dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (27%) and 4 of 32 DZ twin pairs overall (12. 5%). Nonsignificant increases in similarity with regard to age at disease onset and all of the disease severity scores assessed were noted in disease-concordant MZ twins compared with concordant DZ twins. HLA-B27 and B60 were associated with the disease in probands, and the rate of disease concordance was significantly increased among DZ twin pairs in which the co-twin was positive for both B27 and DR1. Additive genetic effects were estimated to contribute 97% of the population variance. CONCLUSION Susceptibility to AS is largely genetically determined, and the environmental trigger for the disease is probably ubiquitous. HLA-B27 accounts for a minority of the overall genetic susceptibility to AS.
OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotypes to biochemical phenotype and cognitive development in maternal phenylketonuria (PKU). METHODOLOGY PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study (MPKUCS). A total of 84 different mutations were detected, and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals. Based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations, 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity (severe PKU, moderate PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [MHP]). Then, 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications. The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity. These patients are considered functionally hemizygous. RESULTS The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level. Cognitive performance (IQ) was also significantly related to genotype. The IQ of PAH-deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96, respectively, whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84, respectively. Of the patients with PKU, 92% had been treated during childhood. Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations. Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for > 6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group. CONCLUSIONS The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances. Both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with PKU. The significant relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with PKU who plan pregnancy..
OBJECTIVE To monitor the effects of dietary treatment in adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) by means of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs). BACKGROUND SEPs and MEPs have proved useful in revealing signs of progressively severe, central dying-back axonopathy in early stages of adult-onset ALD. METHODS Eight patients with adult-onset ALD underwent clinical examination, brain and spine MRI, and SEP and MEP studies before and after 3 years of Lorenzos oil dietary therapy. RESULTS Before treatment, brain MRI was normal in five patients. Three of these patients had pure spinal SEP abnormalities and in the remaining two patients SEPs showed signs of involvement of both the spinal and cerebral somatosensory tracts. After treatment, the three patients with pure spinal abnormalities showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening, whereas the two patients with a more advanced stage of disease (exhibited by SEPs) showed substantially unchanged clinical and neurophysiologic features. The patients with abnormal brain MRI at the onset of treatment showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening. CONCLUSIONS Lorenzos oil therapy had no effect on patients with evidence of inflammatory brain lesions. Moreover, in patients without clear signs of inflammatory damage, this treatment does not modify significantly the natural course of the disease. However, because effective treatments should begin before the onset of severe neurologic symptoms, SEPs and MEPs should be considered to evaluate the effectiveness of other experimental treatments in the patient with a negative brain MRI.
OBJECTIVE. To clarify whether colchicine is excreted in breast milk, and to compare its concentrations in the serum and breast milk of lactating women who have familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). METHODS. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, we determined colchicine concentrations in the serum and breast milk of 4 patients at various time points, following oral administration of the drug. The study evaluated 4 patients with FMF who had been taking colchicine on a long-term basis. RESULTS. Colchicine was found to be excreted in breast milk. Its levels ranged between 1. 9 and 8. 6 ng/ml, which were similar to those found in the serum (parallel concentration time curves). However, there appeared to be a considerable variation in colchicine milk concentration among the different patients, which might be related to individual breast milk composition and, possibly, to other nutritional or metabolic factors. CONCLUSION. The extensive peripheral tissue binding and relatively low concentration of colchicine in breast milk suggests that the amount ingested by the infant is small. Furthermore, based on our clinical experience, nursing appears to be safe for lactating women with FMF who continue to take colchicine.
OBJECTIVE: A case of acute myocarditis associated with the commencement of clozapine is described, highlighting the onset, course and possible contributing factors. There is an urgent need to raise awareness about this potentially fatal complication of clozapine use. RESULTS: A 20-year-old male with schizophrenia developed a sudden onset of myocarditis after commencement of clozapine. The patient recovered with intensive medical support. The symptoms occurred around 2 weeks after starting clozapine in an inpatient setting. Possible contributing factors may have been concomitant antidepressant use and unaccustomed physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Myocarditis is an increasingly recognized complication associated with the use of clozapine. It can be fatal if not recognized and treated early. Considering that clozapine remains the gold standard in treatment of resistant psychosis, there is an urgent need to raise awareness among medical and paramedical staff involved in the care of these patients. There are also implications for recommendations and regulations regarding the use of clozapine.
OBJECTIVE: A multicenter, controlled trial showed that early blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes and normoalbuminuria did not retard the progression of nephropathy, suggesting that other mechanism(s) are involved in the pathogenesis of early diabetic nephropathy (diabetic nephropathy). We have previously demonstrated that endothelial-mesenchymal-transition (EndoMT) contributes to the early development of renal interstitial fibrosis independently of microalbuminuria in mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. In the present study, we hypothesized that blocking EndoMT reduces the early development of diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: EndoMT was induced in a mouse pancreatic microvascular endothelial cell line (MMEC) in the presence of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and in the endothelial lineage-traceble mouse line Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP by administration of AGEs, with nonglycated mouse albumin serving as a control. Phosphorylated Smad3 was detected by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting and confocal microscopy. Blocking studies using receptor for AGE siRNA and a specific inhibitor of Smad3 (SIS3) were performed in MMECs and in STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy in Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP mice. RESULTS: Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR demonstrated that AGEs induced EndoMT in MMECs and in Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP mice. Immunoprecipitation/Western blotting showed that Smad3 was activated by AGEs but was inhibited by SIS3 in MMECs and in STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy. Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR further demonstrated that SIS3 abrogated EndoMT, reduced renal fibrosis, and retarded progression of nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: EndoMT is a novel pathway leading to early development of diabetic nephropathy. Blockade of EndoMT by SIS3 may provide a new strategy to retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy and other diabetes complications.
OBJECTIVE: A randomised, double-blind study to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability, safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 4086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily (n = 2032) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (n = 2054). Use of gastroprotective agents and low-dose aspirin was allowed. The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences (AEs). General safety was also assessed, including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data. Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS; 0-4 point scale). RESULTS: Mean (SD; maximum) duration of treatment was 19.3 (10.3; 32.9) and 19.1 (10.4; 33.1) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups, respectively. The cumulative discontinuation rate due to GI AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac (5.2 vs 8.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.81; p<or=0.001)). The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension-related and oedema-related AEs were significantly higher with etoricoxib (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with diclofenac (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for hypertension and p<0.01 for oedema). Etoricoxib and diclofenac treatment resulted in similar efficacy (PGADS mean changes from baseline -0.62 vs -0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to GI AEs compared with diclofenac 150 mg. Discontinuations from renovascular AEs, although less common than discontinuations from GI AEs, were significantly higher with etoricoxib.
OBJECTIVE: Conventional treatment methods of lumbusacral radiculopathy are physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, oral medications, and spinal manipulative therapy. Cauda equina syndrome is a rare complication of epidural anesthesia. The following case is a report of cauda equina syndrome possibly caused by epidural injection of triamcinolone and bupivacaine. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 50-year-old woman with low back and right leg pain was scheduled for epidural steroid injection. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: An 18-gauge Touhy needle was inserted until loss of resistance occurred at the L4-5 level. Spread of the contrast medium within the epidural space was determined by radiographic imaging. After verifying the epidural space, bupivacaine and triamcinolone diacetate were injected. After the injection, there was a reduction in radicular symptoms. Three hours later, she complained of perineal numbness and lower extremity weakness. The neurologic evaluation revealed loss of sensation in the saddle area and medial aspect of her right leg. There was a decrease in the perception of pinprick test. Deep-tendon reflexes were decreased especially in the right leg. She was unable to urinate. The patient's symptoms improved slightly over the next few hours. She had a gradual return of motor function and ability of feeling Foley catheter. All of the symptoms were completely resolved over the next 8 hours. CONCLUSION: Complications associated with epidural steroid injections are rare. Clinical examination and continued vigilance for neurologic deterioration after epidural steroid injections is important.
OBJECTIVE: Dexmedetomidine and propofol are commonly used sedatives in neurocritical care as they allow for frequent neurologic examinations. However, both agents are associated with significant hemodynamic side effects. The primary objective of this study is to compare the prevalence of severe hemodynamic effects in neurocritical care patients receiving dexmedetomidine and propofol. DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective, propensity-matched cohort study. SETTING: Neurocritical care units at two academic medical centers with dedicated neurocritical care teams and board-certified neurointensivists. PATIENTS: Neurocritical care patients admitted between July 2009 and September 2012 were evaluated and then matched 1:1 based on propensity scoring of baseline characteristics. INTERVENTIONS: Continuous sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 342 patients (105 dexmedetomidine and 237 propofol) were included in the analysis, with 190 matched (95 in each group) by propensity score. The primary outcome of this study was a composite of severe hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 60 mm Hg) and bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats/min) during sedative infusion. No difference in the primary composite outcome in both the unmatched (30% vs 30%, p = 0.94) or matched cohorts (28% vs 34%, p = 0.35) could be found. When analyzed separately, no differences could be found in the prevalence of severe hypotension or bradycardia in either the unmatched or matched cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Severe hypotension and bradycardia occur at similar prevalence in neurocritical care patients who receive dexmedetomidine or propofol. Providers should similarly consider the likelihood of hypotension or bradycardia before starting either sedative.
OBJECTIVE: Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of renal failure, which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Here, we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic nephropathy patients, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy model in Nrf2(-/-) mice, and cultured human mesangial cells. RESULTS: The glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels. In the animal study, Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin-induced renal damage. This is evident by Nrf2(-/-) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and renal injury compared with Nrf2(+/+) mice. Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2-mediated protection against diabetic nephropathy is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production. In human renal mesangial cells, high glucose induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes. Furthermore, activation or overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF-beta1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced TGF-beta1 transcription and fibronectin production. CONCLUSIONS: This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
OBJECTIVE: Diazinon, a common organophosphate insecticide with genotoxic properties, was previously associated with lung cancer in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort, but few other epidemiological studies have examined diazinon-associated cancer risk. We used updated diazinon exposure and cancer incidence information to evaluate solid tumour risk in the AHS. METHODS: Male pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina reported lifetime diazinon use at enrolment (1993-1997) and follow-up (1998-2005); cancer incidence was assessed through 2010(North Carolina)/2011(Iowa). Among applicators with usage information sufficient to evaluate exposure-response patterns, we used Poisson regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CI for cancer sites with >10 exposed cases for both lifetime (LT) exposure days and intensity-weighted (IW) lifetime exposure days (accounting for factors impacting exposure). RESULTS: We observed elevated lung cancer risks (N=283) among applicators with the greatest number of LT (RR=1.60; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.31; Ptrend=0.02) and IW days of diazinon use (RR=1.41; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.04; Ptrend=0.08). Kidney cancer (N=94) risks were non-significantly elevated (RRLT days=1.77; 95% CI 0.90 to 3.51; Ptrend=0.09; RRIW days 1.37; 95% CI 0.64 to 2.92; Ptrend=0.50), as were risks for aggressive prostate cancer (N=656). CONCLUSIONS: Our updated evaluation of diazinon provides additional evidence of an association with lung cancer risk. Newly identified links to kidney cancer and associations with aggressive prostate cancer require further evaluation.
OBJECTIVE: In this study the effect of glyceryl trinitrate on the prostigmine-morphine-induced sphincter of Oddi spasm was evaluated in nine female patients with sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia. METHOD: Sphincter of Oddi spasm was induced by prostigmine-morphine administration (0.5 mg prostigmine intramuscularly and 10 mg morphine subcutaneously) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy. The entire procedure was repeated during glyceryl trinitrate infusion (Nitrolingual 1 microg/kg/min for 120 min). RESULTS: Prostigmine-morphine provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 +/- 5.05 vs. 22.77 +/- 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 +/- 5.99 vs. 40.0 +/- 2.88) and in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 +/- 16.01 vs. 27.37 +/- 2.19), HH (117.61 +/- 14.71 vs. 31.85 +/- 3.99) and CBD (158.11 +/- 9.18 vs. 40.1 +/- 6.24), indicating a complete spasm at the level of the sphincter of Oddi. Glyceryl trinitrate infusion completely normalized the prostigmine-morphine-induced alterations in these quantitative parameters (TmaX over the LP: 11.33 +/- 1.13; over the HH: 18.88 +/- 1.48; and over the CBD: 36.22 +/- 1.92; and T1/2 over the LP: 28.21 +/- 1.83; over the HH: 33.42 +/- 3.10; and over the CBD: 41.66 +/- 6.33), suggesting an effective sphincter-relaxing effect of glyceryl trinitrate. CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate on the morphine-induced sphincter of Oddi spasm in humans. Since glyceryl trinitrate is able to overcome even the drastic effect of morphine, it might be of relevance in the treatment of sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia.
OBJECTIVE: In vitro work has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 2D6. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 activity, using desipramine as a probe substrate, in healthy subjects. METHODS: Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, crossover study to receive a single oral dose of desipramine (50 mg) on two separate occasions, once alone and once after multiple doses of cinacalcet (90 mg for 7 days). Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose. RESULTS: Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms. Relative to desipramine alone, mean AUC and C(max) of desipramine increased 3.6- and 1.8-fold when coadministered with cinacalcet. The t (1/2,z) of desipramine was longer when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet (21.0 versus 43.3 hs). The t (max) was similar between the regimens. Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (nausea and headache) have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6. These data suggest that during concomitant treatment with cinacalcet, dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by CYP2D6.
OBJECTIVE: Maternal tobacco smoking has negative effects on fetal growth. The influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated, although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adults. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) of healthy neonates. METHODS: This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns. Newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy (n=200 ears) were compared to a control group of newborns (n=200 ears), whose mothers were non-smokers. Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low (<5 cigarettes per day, n=88 ears), moderate (5< or =cigarettes per day<10, n=76) or high (> or =10 cigarettes per day, n=36). RESULTS: In exposed neonates, TEOAEs mean response (across frequency) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non-exposed neonates. Comparisons between exposed newborns' subgroups revealed no significant differences. However, by comparing each subgroup to control group, we found statistically significant decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes at 4000Hz for all three groups. Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group. CONCLUSION: In utero, exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells. These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns, regardless of the degree of exposure. Further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal smoking on the neonate's hearing acuity.
OBJECTIVE: Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA)-positive vasculitis has been reported in patients with Graves' disease who were treated with propylthiouracil (PTU). The appearance of MPO-ANCA in these cases was suspected of being related to PTU because the titres of MPO-ANCA decreased when PTU was stopped. Nevertheless, there have been no studies on the temporal relationship between the appearance of MPO-ANCA and vasculitis during PTU therapy, or on the incidence of MPO-ANCA in untreated Graves' disease patients. Therefore, we sought to address these parameters in patients with Graves' disease. PATIENTS: We investigated 102 untreated patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease for the presence of MPO-ANCA, and for the development vasculitis after starting PTU therapy. Twenty-nine of them were later excluded because of adverse effects of PTU or because the observation period was less than 3 months. The remaining 73 patients (55 women and 18 men), all of whom were examined for more than 3 months, were adopted as the subjects of the investigation. The median observation period was 23.6 months (range: 3-37 months). MEASUREMENTS: MPO-ANCA was measured at intervals of 2-6 months. RESULTS: Before treatment, the MPO-ANCA titres of all 102 untreated Graves' disease patients were within the reference range (below 10 U/ml). Three (4.1%) of the 73 patients were positive for MPO-ANCA at 13, 16 and 17 months, respectively, after the start of PTU therapy. In two of them, the MPO-ANCA titres transiently increased to 12.8 and 15.0 U/ml, respectively, despite continued PTU therapy, but no vasculitic disorders developed. In the third patient, the MPO-ANCA titre increased to 204 U/ml and she developed a higher fever, oral ulcers and polyarthralgia, but the symptoms resolved 2 weeks after stopping PTU therapy, and the MPO-ANCA titre decreased to 20.7 U/ml by 4 months after discontinuing PTU. CONCLUSIONS: PTU therapy may be related to the appearance of MPO-ANCA, but MPO-ANCA does not appear to be closely related to vasculitis.
OBJECTIVE: Nephrotoxicity is the major adverse effect of amphotericin B (AmB), often limiting administration of full dosage. Selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with AmB. Potassium depletion also potentiates the tubular toxicity of AmB. This study was designed to assess the ability of spironolactone to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment. METHODS: In this study 26 patients with various hematological disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous AmB alone or AmB and oral spironolactone 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected fungal infection. RESULTS: Patients receiving concomitant AmB and spironolactone had significantly higher plasma potassium levels than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.0027). Those patients receiving AmB and spironolactone required significantly less potassium supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range (P = 0.022). Moreover, urinary potassium losses were significantly less in patients receiving AmB and spironolactone than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.040). CONCLUSION: This study showed that spironolactone can reduce potassium requirements and prevent hypokalemia by reducing urinary potassium loss in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment.
OBJECTIVE: Post-mortem studies have reported abnormalities of the cholinergic system in autism. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of galantamine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and nicotinic receptor modulator, in the treatment of interfering behaviors in children with autism. METHODS: Thirteen medication-free children with autism (mean age, 8.8 +/- 3.5 years) participated in a 12-week, open-label trial of galantamine. Patients were rated monthly by parents on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised, and by a physician using the Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions scale. RESULTS: Patients showed a significant reduction in parent-rated irritability and social withdrawal on the ABC as well as significant improvements in emotional lability and inattention on the Conners' Parent Rating Scale--Revised. Similarly, clinician ratings showed reductions in the anger subscale of the Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale. Eight of 13 participants were rated as responders on the basis of their improvement scores on the Clinical Global Impressions scale. Overall, galantamine was well-tolerated, with no significant adverse effects apart from headaches in one patient. CONCLUSION: In this open trial, galantamine was well-tolerated and appeared to be beneficial for the treatment of interfering behaviors in children with autism, particularly aggression, behavioral dyscontrol, and inattention. Further controlled trials are warranted.
OBJECTIVE: Quetiapine is a dibenzothiazepine derivative, similar to clozapine, which has the highest risk of causing blood dyscrasias, especially neutropenia. There are some case reports about this side effect of quetiapine, but possible risk factors are seldom discussed and identified. A case of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma that developed neutropenia after treatment with quetiapine is described here. CASE REPORT: A 62-year-old Taiwanese widow with bipolar disorder was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma at age 60. She developed leucopenia after being treated with quetiapine. After quetiapine was discontinued, her white blood cell count returned to normal. CONCLUSIONS: Although neutropenia is not a common side effect of quetiapine, physicians should be cautious about its presentation and associated risk factors. Hepatic dysfunction may be one of the possible risk factors, and concomitant fever may be a diagnostic marker for adverse reaction to quetiapine.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia on trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in children and adolescents. METHOD: Medically healthy 7- to 17-year-old males chronically treated, in a naturalistic setting, with risperidone were recruited for this cross-sectional study through child psychiatry outpatient clinics between November 2005 and June 2007. Anthropometric measurements and laboratory testing were conducted. The clinical diagnoses were based on chart review, and developmental and treatment history was obtained from the medical record. Volumetric BMD of the ultradistal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and areal BMD of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Hyperprolactinemia was present in 49% of 83 boys (n = 41) treated with risperidone for a mean of 2.9 years. Serum testosterone concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by hyperprolactinemia. As expected, bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity. After adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and BMI z scores, serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius (P < .03). Controlling for relevant covariates, we also found treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius (P = .03) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine (P < .05). These findings became more marked when the analysis was restricted to non-Hispanic white patients. Of 13 documented fractures, 3 occurred after risperidone and SSRIs were started, and none occurred in patients with hyperprolactinemia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to link risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia and SSRI treatment to lower BMD in children and adolescents. Future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate ensues.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new fixed-dose combination (FDC) of telmisartan 40 mg + amlodipine 5 mg (T+A) compared with amlodipine 5-mg monotherapy (A) in adult Indian patients with stage II hypertension. METHODS: This comparative, Phase III, 12-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted in Indian patients aged 18 to 65 years with established stage II hypertension. Patients were treated with oral FDC of T+A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks; blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position. Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP (SBP)/ diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to study end and number of responders (ie, patients who achieved target SBP/ DBP <130/<80 mm Hg) at end of study. Tolerability was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events, identified using physical examination, laboratory analysis, and electrocardiography. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study; 203 patients (143 men, 60 women) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow-up (4 patients in the T+A group and 3 in the A group) and considered with-drawn. At study end, statistically significant percentage reductions from baseline within groups and between groups were observed in SBP (T+A [-27.4%]; A [-16.6%]) and DBP (T+A [-20.1%]; A [-13.3%]) (all, P < 0.05). Response rates were 87.3% (89/102) in the T+A group and 69.3% (70/101) in the A group (P < 0.05). The prevalences of adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups (T+A, 16.0% [17/106]; A, 15.4% [16/104]). Peripheral edema was reported in 8.5% patients (9/106) in the T+A group compared with 13.5% (14/104) in the A group, and cough was reported in 3.8% patients (4/106) in the T+A group and 1.0% (1/104) patients in the A group; these differences did not reach statistical significance. The incidences of headache, dizziness, and diarrhea were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among these Indian patients with stage II hypertension, the FDC of T+A was found to be significantly more effective, with regard to BP reductions, than A, and both treatments were well tolerated.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether fluoxetine given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused hyperprolactinemia and its effects with respect to adenomyosis. DESIGN: Fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce hyperprolactinemia. The drug was given to two groups consisting of castrated and noncastrated rats and compared to two groups of castrated and noncastrated controls. Prolactin levels were measured and the uteri of the rats were removed for histopathological analysis at the end of 98 days. SETTING: Marmara University School of Medicine, Department of Histology and Embryology, Zeynep Kamil Women and Children's Hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum prolactin levels, uterine histopathology. RESULTS: The prolactin levels of castrated and noncastrated groups treated with fluoxetine were statistically significantly higher when compared to their respective control groups. Histological studies revealed 11 cases of adenomyosis, all within the noncastrated group receiving fluoxetine. CONCLUSION: It was suggested that high serum prolactin levels cause degeneration of myometrial cells in the presence of ovarian steroids that results in a myometrial invasion by endometrial stroma. This invasion eventually progresses to adenomyosis.
OBJECTIVE: The authors compared 4-month treatment outcomes for olanzapine versus risperidone in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHOD: One hundred twelve subjects (70% male; mean age=23.3 years [SD = 5.1]) with first-episode schizophrenia (75%), schizophreniform disorder (17%), or schizoaffective disorder (8%) were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (2.5-20 mg/day) or risperidone (1-6 mg/day). RESULTS: Response rates did not significantly differ between olanzapine (43.7%, 95% CI=28.8%-58.6%) and risperidone (54.3%, 95% CI=39.9%-68.7%). Among those responding to treatment, more subjects in the olanzapine group (40.9%, 95% CI=16.8%-65.0%) than in the risperidone group (18.9%, 95% CI=0%-39.2%) had subsequent ratings not meeting response criteria. Negative symptom outcomes and measures of parkinsonism and akathisia did not differ between medications. Extrapyramidal symptom severity scores were 1.4 (95% CI=1.2-1.6) with risperidone and 1.2 (95% CI=1.0-1.4) with olanzapine. Significantly more weight gain occurred with olanzapine than with risperidone: the increase in weight at 4 months relative to baseline weight was 17.3% (95% CI=14.2%-20.5%) with olanzapine and 11.3% (95% CI=8.4%-14.3%) with risperidone. Body mass index at baseline and at 4 months was 24.3 (95% CI=22.8-25.7) versus 28.2 (95% CI=26.7-29.7) with olanzapine and 23.9 (95% CI=22.5-25.3) versus 26.7 (95% CI=25.2-28.2) with risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical outcomes with risperidone were equal to those with olanzapine, and response may be more stable. Olanzapine may have an advantage for motor side effects. Both medications caused substantial rapid weight gain, but weight gain was greater with olanzapine.
OBJECTIVE: The globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation. Previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum, and systemic administration of a neurotensin analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol-induced parkinsonian symptoms. METHODS: Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study. RESULTS: Bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol-induced parkinsonian catalepsy in rats. Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of neurotensin induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration. The neurotensin type-1 receptor antagonist SR48692 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by neurotensin. CONCLUSION: Activation of pallidal neurotensin receptors may be involved in neurotensin-induced antiparkinsonian effects.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of psychosis and disruptive behaviors in patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: In a 6-week random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase A), haloperidol, 2-3 mg/day (standard dose), and haloperidol, 0.50-0.75 mg/day (low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease. For the subsequent 6-week double-blind crossover phase (phase B), patients taking standard- or low-dose haloperidol were switched to placebo, and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard- or low-dose haloperidol. RESULTS: For the 60 patients who completed phase A, standard-dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low-dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation. Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose (55%-60%) than the low dose (25%-35%) and placebo (25%-30%). The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B. In phase A, extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions, primarily because of a subgroup (20%) who developed moderate to severe signs. Low-dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2-3 mg/day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs. A starting dose of 1 mg/day with gradual, upward dose titration is recommended. The narrow therapeutic window observed with haloperidol may also apply to other neuroleptics used in Alzheimer's disease patients with psychosis and disruptive behaviors.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for cocaine or amphetamine in adult emergency department seizure patients. METHODS: This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible seizure patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation. Plasma was tested for amphetamine and the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine using enzyme-mediated immunoassay methodology. Plasma samples with benzoylecgonine greater than 150 ng/mL or an amphetamine greater than 500 ng/mL were defined as positive. Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or alcohol-related seizure disorder, estimated time from seizure to sample collection, history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers. RESULTS: Fourteen of 248 (5.6%, 95% CI 2.7%-8.5%) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for benzoylecgonine and no samples (0%, 95% CI 0-1.2%) were positive for amphetamine. Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse (p < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: During this study period, routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult seizure patients had a low yield. As a result, routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of drug abuse in this population.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the risk of lifetime and current methamphetamine-induced psychosis in patients with methamphetamine dependence. The association between psychiatric co-morbidity and methamphetamine-induced psychosis was also studied. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted concurrently at a teaching hospital and a drug rehabilitation center in Malaysia. Patients with the diagnosis of methamphetamine based on DSM-IV were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) for methamphetamine-induced psychosis and other Axis I psychiatric disorders. The information on sociodemographic background and drug use history was obtained from interview or medical records. RESULTS: Of 292 subjects, 47.9% of the subjects had a past history of psychotic symptoms and 13.0% of the patients were having current psychotic symptoms. Co-morbid major depressive disorder (OR=7.18, 95 CI=2.612-19.708), bipolar disorder (OR=13.807, 95 CI=5.194-36.706), antisocial personality disorder (OR=12.619, 95 CI=6.702-23.759) and heavy methamphetamine uses were significantly associated with lifetime methamphetamine-induced psychosis after adjusted for other factors. Major depressive disorder (OR=2.870, CI=1.154-7.142) and antisocial personality disorder (OR=3.299, 95 CI=1.375-7.914) were the only factors associated with current psychosis. CONCLUSION: There was a high risk of psychosis in patients with methamphetamine dependence. It was associated with co-morbid affective disorder, antisocial personality, and heavy methamphetamine use. It is recommended that all cases of methamphetamine dependence should be screened for psychotic symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the incidence and to monitor the progression of hearing loss in children and young adults with beta-thalassemia major. METHODS: One hundred and four (104) patients aged 6-35 years (mean 17,2 years) participated in the study. All patients were on a regular transfusion-chelation program maintaining a mean hemoglobin level of 9.5 gr/dl. Subjects were receiving desferrioxamine (DFO) chelation treatment with a mean daily dose of 50-60 mg/kg, 5-6 days a week during the first six years of the study, which was then reduced to 40-50 mg/kg for the following eight years. Patients were followed for 8-14 years. RESULTS: Overall, 21 out of 104 patients (20.2%) presented with high frequency sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), either unilateral or bilateral. No ototoxic factor, other than DFO, was present in any of the patients. Patients with SNHL presented with relatively lower serum ferritin levels than those with normal hearing, however, no statistically significant difference was observed. Subjects with SNHL were submitted to DFO reduction or temporary withdrawal. Following intervention, 7 out of 21 affected patients recovered, 10 remained stable and 4 demonstrated aggravation. CONCLUSION: The findings are indicative of DFO's contributing role in the development of hearing impairment. Regular audiologic evaluation is imperative in all thalassemic patients so that early changes may be recognized and treatment may be judiciously adjusted in order to prevent or reverse hearing impairment.
OBJECTIVE: The outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with cocaine abuse is reportedly poor. However, no study in the literature has reported the use of a statistical model to analyze the variables that influence outcome. METHODS: A review of admissions during a 6-year period revealed 14 patients with cocaine-related aneurysms. This group was compared with a control group of 135 patients with ruptured aneurysms and no history of cocaine abuse. Age at presentation, time of ictus after intoxication, Hunt and Hess grade of subarachnoid hemorrhage, size of the aneurysm, location of the aneurysm, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score were assessed and compared. RESULTS: The patients in the study group were significantly younger than the patients in the control group (P < 0.002). In patients in the study group, all aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation. The majority of these aneurysms were smaller than those of the control group (8 +/- 6.08 mm versus 11 +/- 5.4 mm; P = 0.05). The differences in mortality and morbidity between the two groups were not significant. Hunt and Hess grade (P < 0.005) and age (P < 0.007) were significant predictors of outcome for the patients with cocaine-related aneurysms. CONCLUSION: Cocaine use predisposed aneurysmal rupture at a significantly earlier age and in much smaller aneurysms. Contrary to the published literature, this group did reasonably well with aggressive management.
OBJECTIVE: The pharmacological response to drugs that act on the cholinergic system of the iris has been used to predict deficits in central cholinergic functioning due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, yet correlations between central and peripheral responses have not been properly studied. This study assessed the effect of normal aging on (1) the tropicamide-induced increase in pupil diameter, and (2) the reversal of this effect with pilocarpine. Scopolamine was used as a positive control to detect age-dependent changes in central cholinergic functioning in the elderly. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Ten healthy elderly (mean age 70) and 9 young (mean age 33) volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Pupil diameter was monitored using a computerized infrared pupillometer over 4 hours. The study involved 4 sessions. In 1 session, tropicamide (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other. In another session, tropicamide (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to both eyes, followed 23 minutes later by the application of pilocarpine (20 microL, 0.1%) to one eye and placebo to the other. All eye drops were given in a randomized order. In 2 separate sessions, a single dose of scopolamine (0.5 mg, intravenously) or placebo was administered, and the effects on word recall were measured using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test over 2 hours. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pupil size at time points after administration of tropicamide and pilocarpine; scopolamine-induced impairment in word recall. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to tropicamide at any time point (p > 0.05). The elderly group had a significantly greater pilocarpine-induced net decrease in pupil size 85, 125, 165 and 215 minutes after administration, compared with the young group (p < 0.05). Compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater scopolamine-induced impairment in word recall 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is an age-related pupillary response to pilocarpine that is not found with tropicamide. Thus, pilocarpine may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of morning-dosed modafinil on sleep and daytime sleepiness in chronic cocaine users. METHOD: Twenty cocaine-dependent participants were randomly assigned to receive modafinil, 400 mg (N=10), or placebo (N=10) every morning at 7:30 a.m. for 16 days in an inpatient, double-blind randomized trial. Participants underwent polysomnographic sleep recordings on days 1 to 3, 7 to 9, and 14 to 16 (first, second, and third weeks of abstinence). The Multiple Sleep Latency Test was performed at 11:30 a.m., 2:00 p.m., and 4:30 p.m. on days 2, 8, and 15. For comparison of sleep architecture variables, 12 healthy comparison participants underwent a single night of experimental polysomnography that followed 1 night of accommodation polysomnography. RESULTS: Progressive abstinence from cocaine was associated with worsening of all measured polysomnographic sleep outcomes. Compared with placebo, modafinil decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow-wave sleep time in cocaine-dependent participants. The effect of modafinil interacted with the abstinence week and was associated with longer total sleep time and shorter REM sleep latency in the third week of abstinence. Comparison of slow-wave sleep time, total sleep time, and sleep latency in cocaine-dependent and healthy participants revealed a normalizing effect of modafinil in cocaine-dependent participants. Modafinil was associated with increased daytime sleep latency, as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and a nearly significant decrease in subjective daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS: Morning-dosed modafinil promotes nocturnal sleep, normalizes sleep architecture, and decreases daytime sleepiness in abstinent cocaine users. These effects may be relevant in the treatment of cocaine dependence.
OBJECTIVE: There are several complications associated with heroin abuse, some of which are life-threatening. Methadone may aggravate this problem. METHOD: A clinical case description. RESULTS: A 33-year-old man presented with rhabdomyolysis and cerebral ischemic stroke after intravenous heroin. He had used heroin since age 20, and had used 150 mg methadone daily for 6 months. He was found unconsciousness at home and was sent to our hospital. In the ER, his opiate level was 4497 ng/ml. In the ICU, we found rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and acute respiratory failure. After transfer to an internal ward, we noted aphasia and weakness of his left limbs. After MRI, we found cerebral ischemic infarction. CONCLUSION: Those using methadone and heroin simultaneously may increase risk of rhabdomyolysis and ischemic stroke. Patients under methadone maintenance therapy should be warned regarding these serious adverse events. Hypotheses of heroin-related rhabdomyolysis and stroke in heroin abusers are discussed.
OBJECTIVE: This is to present reversible inferior colliculus lesions in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, to focus on the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (age range; 43-78 years). They had been taking metronidazole (total dosage, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the infection in various organs. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained after the hospitalization, including DWI (8/8), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (4/8), FLAIR (7/8), and T2-weighted image (8/8). Follow-up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration. Findings of initial and follow-up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on follow-up images. RESULTS: Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR (or T2-weighted image) at the dentate nucleus (8/8), inferior colliculus (6/8), corpus callosum (2/8), pons (2/8), medulla (1/8), and bilateral cerebral white matter (1/8). High-signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map (3/4), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map. All the lesions in dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medullas had been resolved completely on follow-up MRIs in 5 patients, but in 1 patient of them, corpus callosal lesion persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Reversible inferior colliculus lesions could be considered as the characteristic for metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, next to the dentate nucleus involvement.
OBJECTIVE: This large-scale retrospective review evaluates the sedation profile of dexmedetomidine. AIM: To determine the hemodynamic responses, efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies. Over time, an effective protocol utilizing high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative agent has evolved. METHODS/MATERIALS: As part of the ongoing Quality Assurance process, data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed. Data were analyzed from all 747 consecutive patients who received dexmedetomidine for MRI sedation from April 2005 to April 2007. RESULTS: Since 2005, the 10-min loading dose of our dexmedetomidine protocol increased from 2 to 3 microg.kg(-1), and the infusion rate increased from 1 to 1.5 to 2 microg.kg(-1).h(-1). The current sedation protocol progressively increased the rate of successful sedation (able to complete the imaging study) when using dexmedetomidine alone from 91.8% to 97.6% (P = 0.009), reducing the requirement for adjuvant pentobarbital in the event of sedation failure with dexmedetomidine alone and decreased the mean recovery time by 10 min (P < 0.001). Although dexmedetomidine sedation was associated with a 16% incidence of bradycardia, all concomitant mean arterial blood pressures were within 20% of age-adjusted normal range and oxygen saturations were 95% or higher. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine in high doses provides adequate sedation for pediatric MRI studies. While use of high dose dexmedetomidine is associated with decreases in heart rate and blood pressure outside the established 'awake' norms, this deviation is generally within 20% of norms, and is not associated with adverse sequelae. Dexmedetomidine is useful as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI.
OBJECTIVE: This study describes associations of ozone and fine particulate matter with Parkinson's disease observed among farmers in North Carolina and Iowa. METHODS: We used logistic regression to determine the associations of these pollutants with self-reported, doctor-diagnosed Parkinson's disease. Daily predicted pollutant concentrations were used to derive surrogates of long-term exposure and link them to study participants' geocoded addresses. RESULTS: We observed positive associations of Parkinson's disease with ozone (odds ratio = 1.39; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.98) and fine particulate matter (odds ratio = 1.34; 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.93) in North Carolina but not in Iowa. CONCLUSIONS: The plausibility of an effect of ambient concentrations of these pollutants on Parkinson's disease risk is supported by experimental data demonstrating damage to dopaminergic neurons at relevant concentrations. Additional studies are needed to address uncertainties related to confounding and to examine temporal aspects of the associations we observed.
OBJECTIVE: This study determined the antihyperalgesic effect of CNSB002, a sodium channel blocker with antioxidant properties given alone and in combinations with morphine in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. DESIGN: Dose response curves for nonsedating doses of morphine and CNSB002 given intraperitoneally alone and together in combinations were constructed for antihyperalgesic effect using paw withdrawal from noxious heat in two rat pain models: carrageenan-induced paw inflammation and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic neuropathy. RESULTS: The maximum nonsedating doses were: morphine, 3.2 mg/kg; CNSB002 10.0 mg/kg; 5.0 mg/kg CNSB002 with morphine 3.2 mg/kg in combination. The doses calculated to cause 50% reversal of hyperalgesia (ED50) were 7.54 (1.81) and 4.83 (1.54) in the carrageenan model and 44.18 (1.37) and 9.14 (1.24) in the STZ-induced neuropathy model for CNSB002 and morphine, respectively (mg/kg; mean, SEM). These values were greater than the maximum nonsedating doses. The ED50 values for morphine when given in combination with CNSB002 (5 mg/kg) were less than the maximum nonsedating dose: 0.56 (1.55) in the carrageenan model and 1.37 (1.23) in the neuropathy model (mg/kg; mean, SEM). The antinociception after morphine (3.2 mg/kg) was increased by co-administration with CNSB002 from 28.0 and 31.7% to 114.6 and 56.9% reversal of hyperalgesia in the inflammatory and neuropathic models, respectively (P < 0.01; one-way analysis of variance-significantly greater than either drug given alone). CONCLUSIONS: The maximum antihyperalgesic effect achievable with nonsedating doses of morphine may be increased significantly when the drug is used in combination with CNSB002.
OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the occurrence of hepatic adverse effects encountered with antithyroid drugs. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with hyperthyroidism admitted in our department (in- or out-patients) from 1986 to 1992. RESULTS: Four patients (1.7%) were identified with toxic hepatitis which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent. Two patients had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by carbimazole (N omercazole). Two others had a mixed (cholestatic and cytolytic) hepatitis following carbimazole. One of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic hepatitis which appeared after Benzylthiouracil (Basd ne) had replaced carbimazole. Biological features of hepatitis disappeared in all cases after cessation of the incriminated drug, while biliary, viral and immunological searches were negative. Only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Toxic hepatitis is a potential adverse effect of antithyroid drugs which warrants, as for haematological disturbances, a pre-therapeutic determination and a careful follow-up of relevant biological markers. Moreover, hepatotoxicity may not be restricted to one class of antithyroid agents.
OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine whether patients maintained on a regimen of lithium on a once-per-day schedule have lower urine volumes than do patients receiving multiple doses per day. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study of 85 patients from a lithium clinic who received different dose schedules. Patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of lithium level, creatinine clearance, urine volume, and maximum osmolality. RESULTS: Multiple daily doses of lithium were associated with higher urine volumes. The dosing schedule, duration of lithium treatment, and daily dose of lithium did not affect maximum osmolality or creatinine clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Urine volume can be reduced by giving lithium once daily and/or by lowering the total daily dose. Lithium-induced polyuria seems to be related to extrarenal as well as to renal effects.
OBJECTIVE: To achieve absolute risk estimates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among women on cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol (CPA/EE), and among women on combined oral contraceptives (COCs). METHODS: From the Danish National Register of Patients (NRP), 1996 to 1998, the records of 1.1 million Danish women, ages 15 to 44 years, were searched for evidence of VTE. COC use was ascertained through mailed questionnaires. Sales statistics of COCs and CPA/EE were provided through Danish Drug Statistics. RESULTS: During the time frame of the study, 330 women were found to have had VTE while on COCs. Of these women, 67 were on levonorgestrel-containing COCs. Eleven were on CPA/EE. The corresponding absolute risk of VTE was 3.4 (range, 3.1-3.8) per 10 000 women years among the women on COCs, 4.2 (range, 3.2-5.2) per 10 000 women years among women on levonorgestrel-containing COCs, and 3.1 (range, 1.3-4.9) per 10 000 women years among the women on CPA/EE. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the absolute risk of VTE among Danish women on COCs is similar to that among women taking CPA/EE.
OBJECTIVE: To assess and characterise the risk of bladder cancer, and its relation to cyclophosphamide, in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. METHODS: In the population based, nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, 1969-95, was identified. Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified. Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios (ORs) as relative risk. In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener's granulomatosis, and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, were also estimated. RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively. The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9). Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 69). The absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, and a history of bladder cancer was (non-significantly) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a dose-response relationship between cyclophosphamide and the risk of bladder cancer, high cumulative risks in the entire cohort, and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before Wegener's granulomatosis.
OBJECTIVE: To assess lymphocyte reactivity to dilevalol and to serum containing putative ex vivo dilevalol antigens or metabolites in a case of dilevalol-induced liver injury. PATIENT: A 58-year-old woman with a clinical diagnosis of dilevalol-induced liver injury. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from the patient were cultured in the presence of a solution of dilevalol and also with sera collected from a volunteer before and after dilevalol intake. A similar protocol was performed with lymphocytes from a healthy subject. RESULTS: No lymphocyte proliferation was observed either in the patient or in the healthy volunteer in the presence of dilevalol solutions. A significant proliferative response to serum collected after dilevalol intake was observed in the case of the patient compared with the proliferative response to the serum collected before the drug intake. No reactivity was found when lymphocytes from the healthy subject were tested under similar conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology used allowed the detection of lymphocyte sensitization to sera containing ex vivo-prepared dilevalol antigens, suggesting the involvement of an immunologic mechanism in dilevalol-induced liver injury.
OBJECTIVE: To assess pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of oral levetiracetam administered as an adjunct to phenobarbital treatment in cats with poorly controlled suspected idiopathic epilepsy. DESIGN-Open-label, noncomparative clinical trial. ANIMALS: 12 cats suspected to have idiopathic epilepsy that was poorly controlled with phenobarbital or that had unacceptable adverse effects when treated with phenobarbital. PROCEDURES: Cats were treated with levetiracetam (20 mg/kg [9.1 mg/lb], PO, q 8 h). After a minimum of 1 week of treatment, serum levetiracetam concentrations were measured before and 2, 4, and 6 hours after drug administration, and maximum and minimum serum concentrations and elimination half-life were calculated. Seizure frequencies before and after initiation of levetiracetam treatment were compared, and adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: Median maximum serum levetiracetam concentration was 25.5 microg/mL, median minimum serum levetiracetam concentration was 8.3 microg/mL, and median elimination half-life was 2.9 hours. Median seizure frequency prior to treatment with levetiracetam (2.1 seizures/mo) was significantly higher than median seizure frequency after initiation of levetiracetam treatment (0.42 seizures/mo), and 7 of 10 cats were classified as having responded to levetiracetam treatment (ie, reduction in seizure frequency of >or=50%). Two cats had transient lethargy and inappetence. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that levetiracetam is well tolerated in cats and may be useful as an adjunct to phenobarbital treatment in cats with idiopathic epilepsy.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether prednisone (PDN) produces anxiety and/or cerebral glial changes in rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were studied and 3 groups were formed (8 rats per group). The moderate-dose group received 5 mg/kg/day PDN released from a subcutaneous implant. In the high-dose group, implants containing PDN equivalent to 60 mg/kg/day were applied. In the control group implants contained no PDN. Anxiety was assessed using an open field and elevated plus-maze devices. The number of cells and cytoplasmic transformation of astrocytes and microglia cells were assessed by immunohistochemical analyses. RESULTS: Anxiety was documented in both groups of PDN treated rats compared with controls. The magnitude of transformation of the microglia assessed by the number of intersections was significantly higher in the PDN groups than in controls in the prefrontal cortex (moderate-dose, 24.1; high-dose, 23.6; controls 18.7; p < 0.01) and striatum (moderate-dose 25.6; high-dose 26.3; controls 18.9; p < 0.01), but not in hippocampus. The number of stained microglia cells was significantly higher in the PDN treated groups in the prefrontal cortex than in controls (moderate-dose, 29.1; high-dose, 28.4; control, 17.7 cells per field; p < 0.01). Stained microglia cells were significantly more numerous striatum and hippocampus in the high-dose group compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Subacute exposure to PDN induced anxiety and reactivity of microglia. The relevance of these features for patients using PDN remains to be elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new angiotensin II antagonist, valsartan, with a reference therapy, amlodipine. METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated in double-blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg valsartan or 5 mg amlodipine for 12 weeks. After 8 weeks of therapy, in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled, 5 mg amlodipine was added to the initial therapy. Patients were assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks. Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates. RESULTS: Both valsartan and amlodipine were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Similar decreases were observed in both groups, with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed. For the primary variable the difference was 0.5 mm Hg in favor of valsartan (p = 0.68; 95% confidence interval, -2.7 to 1.7). Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66.7% for valsartan and 60.2% for amlodipine (p = 0.39). Both treatments were well tolerated. The incidence of drug-related dependent edema was somewhat higher in the amlodipine group, particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day (2.4% for 80 mg valsartan; 3.6% for 5 mg amlodipine; 0% for valsartan plus 5 mg amlodipine; 14.3% for 10 mg amlodipine). CONCLUSIONS: The data show that valsartan is at least as effective as amlodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. The results also show valsartan to be well tolerated and suggest that it is not associated with side effects characteristic of this comparator class, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists.
OBJECTIVE: To describe 3 patients with calcium carbonate-induced hypercalcemia and gain insights into the cause and management of the milk-alkali syndrome. METHODS: We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium > or = 14 mg/dL) and review the pertinent literature on milk-alkali syndrome. RESULTS: The 3 patients had acute renal insufficiency, relative metabolic alkalosis, and low parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related peptide, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations. No malignant lesion was found. Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of furosemide. The 2 patients with the higher serum calcium concentrations received pamidronate intravenously (60 and 30 mg, respectively), which caused severe hypocalcemia. Of the 3 patients, 2 were ingesting acceptable doses of elemental calcium (1 g and 2 g daily, respectively) in the form of calcium carbonate. In addition to our highlighted cases, we review the history, classification, pathophysiologic features, and treatment of milk-alkali syndrome and summarize the cases reported from early 1995 to November 2003. CONCLUSION: Milk-alkali syndrome may be a common cause of unexplained hypercalcemia and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested calcium carbonate in susceptible persons. Treatment with hydration, furosemide, and discontinuation of the calcium and vitamin D source is adequate. Pamidronate treatment is associated with considerable risk for hypocalcemia, even in cases of initially severe hypercalcemia.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of flecainide-induced delirium associated with a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with paroxetine. CASE SUMMARY: A 69-year-old white female presented to the emergency department with a history of confusion and paranoia over the past several days. On admission the patient was taking carvedilol 12 mg twice daily, warfarin 2 mg/day, folic acid 1 mg/day, levothyroxine 100 microg/day, pantoprazole 40 mg/day, paroxetine 40 mg/day, and flecainide 100 mg twice daily. Flecainide had been started 2 weeks prior for atrial fibrillation. Laboratory test findings on admission were notable only for a flecainide plasma concentration of 1360 microg/L (reference range 200-1000). A metabolic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine, which the patient had been taking for more than 5 years, was considered. Paroxetine was discontinued and the dose of flecainide was reduced to 50 mg twice daily. Her delirium resolved 3 days later. DISCUSSION: Flecainide and pharmacologically similar agents that interact with sodium channels may cause delirium in susceptible patients. A MEDLINE search (1966-January 2009) revealed one in vivo pharmacokinetic study on the interaction between flecainide, a CYP2D6 substrate, and paroxetine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, as well as 3 case reports of flecainide-induced delirium. According to the Naranjo probability scale, flecainide was the probable cause of the patient's delirium; the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale indicates a possible pharmacokinetic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine. CONCLUSIONS: Supratherapeutic flecainide plasma concentrations may cause delirium. Because toxicity may occur when flecainide is prescribed with paroxetine and other potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, flecainide plasma concentrations should be monitored closely with commencement of CYP2D6 inhibitors.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of propylthiouracil-induced vasculitis manifesting with pericarditis. METHODS: We present the first case report of a woman with hyperthyroidism treated with propylthiouracil in whom a syndrome of pericarditis, fever, and glomerulonephritis developed. Serologic testing and immunologic studies were done, and a pericardial biopsy was performed. RESULTS: A 25-year-old woman with Graves' disease had a febrile illness and evidence of pericarditis, which was confirmed by biopsy. Serologic evaluation revealed the presence of perinuclear-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (pANCA) against myeloperoxidase (MPO). Propylthiouracil therapy was withdrawn, and she was treated with a 1-month course of prednisone, which alleviated her symptoms. A literature review revealed no prior reports of pericarditis in anti-MPO pANCA-positive vasculitis associated with propylthio- uracil therapy. CONCLUSION: Pericarditis may be the initial manifestation of drug-induced vasculitis attributable to propylthio- uracil therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To describe associations between the use of benzodiazepines or related drugs (BZDs/RDs) and health, functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly. METHODS: A non-randomised clinical study of patients aged > or =65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month. 164 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD] 81.6 +/- 6.8 years) were admitted. Of these, nearly half (n = 78) had used BZDs/RDs before admission, and the remainder (n = 86) were non-users. Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patients scoring > or =20 MMSE sum points were interviewed (n = 79) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission. Data on use of BZDs/RDs before admission, current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records. Health, physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD/RD users and non-users, and adjustments were made for confounding variables. The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam, temazepam and zopiclone were analysed. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD duration of BZD/RD use was 7 +/- 7 years (range 1-31). Two or three BZDs/RDs were concomitantly taken by 26% of users (n = 20). Long-term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS, which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia. After adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of BZDs/RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE. However, use of BZDs/RDs was associated with dizziness, inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay. Use of BZDs/RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night-time sleep during the week prior to admission. A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD/RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses. Long-term use was associated with daytime and night-time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of haematological, renal, hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicities in tumour-bearing dogs receiving 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU). DESIGN: The medical records of 206 dogs that were treated with CCNU at the Melbourne Veterinary Specialist Centre between February 2002 and December 2007 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 206 dogs treated with CCNU, 185 met the inclusion criteria for at least one class of toxicity. CCNU was used most commonly in the treatment of lymphoma, mast cell tumour, brain tumour, histiocytic tumours and epitheliotropic lymphoma. Throughout treatment, 56.9% of dogs experienced neutropenia, 34.2% experienced anaemia and 14.2% experienced thrombocytopenia. Gastrointestinal toxicosis was detected in 37.8% of dogs, the most common sign of which was vomiting (24.3%). Potential renal toxicity and elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) concentration were reported in 12.2% and 48.8% of dogs, respectively. The incidence of hepatic failure was 1.2%. CONCLUSIONS: CCNU-associated toxicity in dogs is common, but is usually not life threatening.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the unmasking of pheochromocytoma in a patient treated with amisulpride and tiapride. CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg. Both drugs were immediately discontinued, and the patient recovered after subsequent nicardipine and verapamil treatment. Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass, and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. DISCUSSION: Drug-induced symptoms of pheochromocytoma are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In our case, use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and amisulpride and tiapride therapy. CONCLUSIONS: As of March 24, 2005, this is the first reported case of amisulpride- and tiapride-induced hypertensive crisis in a patient with pheochromocytoma. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of tiapride and amisulpride.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carbetocin (a long-acting synthetic analogue of oxytocin), when administered immediately after vaginal delivery at term. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carbetocin was given as an intramuscular injection immediately after the birth of the infant in 45 healthy women with normal singleton pregnancies who delivered vaginally at term. Dosage groups of 15, 30, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 or 200 microg carbetocin were assigned to blocks of three women according to the continual reassessment method (CRM). RESULTS: All dosage groups consisted of three women, except those with 100 microg (n=6) and 200 microg (n=18). Recorded were dose-limiting adverse events: hyper- or hypotension (three), severe abdominal pain (0), vomiting (0) and retained placenta (four). Serious adverse events occurred in seven women: six cases with blood loss > or = 1000 ml, four cases of manual placenta removal, five cases of additional oxytocics administration and five cases of blood transfusion. Maximum blood loss was greatest at the upper and lower dose levels, and lowest in the 70-125 microg dose range. Four out of six cases with blood loss > or = 1000 ml occurred in the 200 microg group. The majority of additional administration of oxytocics (4/5) and blood transfusion (3/5) occurred in the dose groups of 200 microg. All retained placentae were found in the group of 200 microg. CONCLUSION: The MTD was calculated to be at 200 microg carbetocin.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive bupropion sustained-release (SR) on male sexual dysfunction (SD) induced by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as SD is a common side-effect of SSRIs and the most effective treatments have yet to be determined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The randomized sample consisted of 234 euthymic men who were receiving some type of SSRI. The men were randomly assigned to bupropion SR (150 mg twice daily, 117) or placebo (twice daily, 117) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression-Sexual Function (CGI-SF; the primary outcome measure), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), and Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) (secondary outcome measures). Participants were followed biweekly during study period. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean (sd) scores for CGI-SF were significantly lower, i.e. better, in patients on bupropion SR, at 2.4 (1.2), than in the placebo group, at 3.9 (1.1) (P= 0.01). Men who received bupropion had a significant increase in the total IIEF score (54.4% vs 1.2%; P= 0.003), and in the five different domains of the IIEF. Total ASEX scores were significantly lower, i.e. better, among men who received bupropion than placebo, at 15.5 (4.3) vs 21.5 (4.7) (P= 0.002). The EDITS scores were 67.4 (10.2) for the bupropion and 36.3 (11.7) for the placebo group (P= 0.001). The ASEX score and CGI-SF score were correlated (P= 0.003). In linear regression analyses the CGI-SF score was not affected significantly by the duration of SD, type of SSRI used and age. CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion is an effective treatment for male SD induced by SSRIs. These results provide empirical support for conducting a further study of bupropion.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for hip fracture repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of postoperative delirium. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients (>or=65 years) without preoperative delirium or severe dementia who underwent hip fracture repair under spinal anesthesia with propofol sedation. Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index (BIS), and patients were randomized to receive either deep (BIS, approximately 50) or light (BIS, >or=80) sedation. Postoperative delirium was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition Revised) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery. RESULTS: From April 2, 2005, through October 30, 2008, a total of 114 patients were randomized. The prevalence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the light sedation group (11/57 [19%] vs 23/57 [40%] in the deep sedation group; P=.02), indicating that 1 incident of delirium will be prevented for every 4.7 patients treated with light sedation. The mean +/- SD number of days of delirium during hospitalization was lower in the light sedation group than in the deep sedation group (0.5+/-1.5 days vs 1.4+/-4.0 days; P=.01). CONCLUSION: The use of light propofol sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative delirium by 50% compared with deep sedation. Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple, safe, and cost-effective intervention for preventing postoperative delirium in elderly patients that could be widely and readily adopted.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pharmacological stress leads to prolonged but reversible left ventricular dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease, similar to that seen after exercise. DESIGN: A randomised crossover study of recovery time of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function after exercise and dobutamine induced ischaemia. SUBJECTS: 10 patients with stable angina, angiographically proven coronary artery disease, and normal left ventricular function. INTERVENTIONS: Treadmill exercise and dobutamine stress were performed on different days. Quantitative assessment of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function was performed using transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and at regular intervals after each test. RESULTS: Both forms of stress led to prolonged but reversible systolic and diastolic dysfunction. There was no difference in the maximum double product (p = 0.53) or ST depression (p = 0.63) with either form of stress. After exercise, ejection fraction was reduced at 15 and 30 minutes compared with baseline (mean (SEM), -5.6 (1.5)%, p < 0.05; and -6.1 (2.2)%, p < 0. 01), and at 30 and 45 minutes after dobutamine (-10.8 (1.8)% and -5. 5 (1.8)%, both p < 0.01). Regional analysis showed a reduction in the worst affected segment 15 and 30 minutes after exercise (-27.9 (7.2)% and -28.6 (5.7)%, both p < 0.01), and at 30 minutes after dobutamine (-32 (5.3)%, p < 0.01). The isovolumic relaxation period was prolonged 45 minutes after each form of stress (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with coronary artery disease, dobutamine induced ischaemia results in prolonged reversible left ventricular dysfunction, presumed to be myocardial stunning, similar to that seen after exercise. Dobutamine induced ischaemia could therefore be used to study the pathophysiology of this phenomenon further in patients with coronary artery disease.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between antibacterial medications and selected birth defects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based, multisite, case-control study of women who had pregnancies affected by 1 of more than 30 eligible major birth defects identified via birth defect surveillance programs in 10 states (n = 13 155) and control women randomly selected from the same geographical regions (n = 4941). MAIN EXPOSURE: Reported maternal use of antibacterials (1 month before pregnancy through the end of the first trimester). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Odds ratios (ORs) measuring the association between antibacterial use and selected birth defects adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: The reported use of antibacterials increased during pregnancy, peaking during the third month. Sulfonamides were associated with anencephaly (adjusted OR [AOR] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-8.8), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.6), coarctation of the aorta (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.6), choanal atresia (AOR = 8.0; 95% CI, 2.7-23.5), transverse limb deficiency (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0-5.9), and diaphragmatic hernia (AOR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.4). Nitrofurantoins were associated with anophthalmia or microphthalmos (AOR = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-12.2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (AOR = 4.2; 95% CI, 1.9-9.1), atrial septal defects (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), and cleft lip with cleft palate (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9). Other antibacterial agents that showed associations included erythromycins (2 defects), penicillins (1 defect), cephalosporins (1 defect), and quinolones (1 defect). CONCLUSIONS: Reassuringly, penicillins, erythromycins, and cephalosporins, although used commonly by pregnant women, were not associated with many birth defects. Sulfonamides and nitrofurantoins were associated with several birth defects, indicating a need for additional scrutiny.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate current performance on recommended perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention practices in New Hampshire. METHODS: Data were extracted from 2021 paired mother-infant records for the year 2000 birth cohort in New Hampshire's 25 delivery hospitals. Assessment was done on the following: prenatal screening for hepatitis B and rubella, administration of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose to all infants, administration of hepatitis B immune globulin to infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers, rubella immunity, and administration of in-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine to rubella nonimmune women. RESULTS: Prenatal screening rates for hepatitis B (98.8%) and rubella (99.4%) were high. Hepatitis B vaccine birth dose was administered to 76.2% of all infants. All infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers also received hepatitis B immune globulin. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the month of delivery and infant birth weight were independent predictors of hepatitis B vaccination. The proportion of infants who were vaccinated in January and February 2000 (48.5% and 67.5%, respectively) was less than any other months, whereas the proportion who were vaccinated in December 2000 (88.2%) was the highest. Women who were born between 1971 and 1975 had the highest rate of rubella nonimmunity (9.5%). In-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine administration was documented for 75.6% of nonimmune women. CONCLUSION: This study documents good compliance in New Hampshire's birthing hospitals with national guidelines for perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention and highlights potential areas for improvement.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen (once-daily vs. twice-daily) of tobramicyn on steady-state serum concentrations and toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment with i.v. tobramycin (4 mg/kg/day) were randomised to two groups. Group OD (n = 22) received a once-daily dose of tobramycin and group TD (n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily. Tobramycin serum concentrations (peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay. The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before, during and immediately after treatment. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable with respect to sex, age, body weight and renal function. No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose, duration of treatment, or cumulative dose. Trough concentrations were < 2 g/ml in the two groups (100%). Peak concentrations were > 6 microg/ml in 100% of the OD group and in 67% of the TD group (P< 0.01). Mean peak concentrations were markedly different: 11.00+/-2.89 microg/ml in OD vs. 6.53+/-1.45 microg/ml in TD (P< 0.01). The pharmacokinetics parameters were: Ke, (0.15+/-0.03/h in OD vs. 0.24+/-0.06/h in TD), t1/2, (4.95+/-1.41 h in OD vs. 3.07+/-0.71 h in TD), Vd (0.35+/-0.11 l/kg in OD vs. 0.33+/-0.09 l/kg in TD), Cl (0.86+/-0.29 ml/min/kg in OD vs. 1.28+/-0.33 ml/min/kg in TD). Increased serum creatinine was observed in 73% of patients in OD versus 57% of patients in TD, without evidence of nephrotoxicity. In TD group, three patients developed decreased auditory function, of which one presented with an auditory loss of -30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented decreased auditory function. CONCLUSION: This small study suggests that a once-daily dosing regimen of tobramycin is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice-daily regimen. Using a single-dose therapy, peak concentration determination is not necessary, only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg/ml.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lovastatin in women with moderate hypercholesterolemia. DESIGN: The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and placebo-controlled trial, in which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lovastatin at doses of 20 or 40 mg once daily, or 20 or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. SETTING: Ambulatory patients recruited by 362 participating centers throughout the United States. PATIENTS: Women (n = 3390) from the total cohort of 8245 volunteers. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides; and laboratory and clinical evidence of adverse events monitored periodically throughout the study. RESULTS: Among women, lovastatin (20 to 80 mg/d) produced sustained (12- to 48-week), dose-related changes (P < 0.001): decreases in LDL cholesterol (24% to 40%) and triglycerides (9% to 18%), and increases in HDL cholesterol (6.7% to 8.6%). Depending on the dose, from 82% to 95% of lovastatin-treated women achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program goal of LDL cholesterol levels less than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL), and 40% to 87% achieved the goal of 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). Successive transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0.1% of women and were dose dependent above the 20-mg dose. Myopathy, defined as muscle symptoms with creatine kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of lovastatin (80 mg). Estrogen-replacement therapy appeared to have no effect on either the efficacy or safety profile of lovastatin. CONCLUSION: Lovastatin is highly effective and generally well tolerated as therapy for primary hypercholesterolemia in women.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible protective effects of misoprostol on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with indomethacin. METHODS: Forty-five hospitalized elderly patients (> 65 years old) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) were randomly assigned to receive either indomethacin, 150 mg/day (Group A), or indomethacin 150 mg/day plus misoprostol at 0.6 mg/day (Group B). Laboratory variables of renal function [serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and electrolytes] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days, until termination of the study (a period of at least 6 days). Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of pain. RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed the study, 22 in Group A and 20 in Group B. BUN and creatinine increased by > 50% of baseline levels in 54 and 45% of Group A patients, respectively, compared to only 20 and 10% of Group B patients (p < 0.05). Potassium (K) increment of 0.6 mEq/l or more was observed in 50% of Group A, but in only 15% of Group B patients (p < 0.05). The mean increments in BUN, creatinine, and K were reduced by 63, 80, and 42%, respectively, in Group B patients compared to Group A. Response to treatment did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing indomethacin related renal dysfunction. Addition of misoprostol can minimize this renal impairment without affecting pain control.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of raloxifene on major adverse events that occur with postmenopausal estrogen therapy or tamoxifen. METHODS: The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, enrolled 7,705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Women were randomly assigned to raloxifene 60 mg/d or 120 mg/d or placebo. Outcomes included venous thromboembolism, cataracts, gallbladder disease, and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (relative risk [RR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.8). The excess event rate was 1.8 per 1,000 woman-years (95% CI -0.5-4.1), and the number needed to treat to cause 1 event was 170 (95% CI 100-582) over 3.3 years. Risk in the raloxifene group was higher than in the placebo group for the first 2 years, but decreased to about the same rate as in the placebo group thereafter. Raloxifene did not increase risk for cataracts (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.1), gallbladder disease (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.7-1.3), endometrial hyperplasia (RR 1.3; 95% CI 0.4-5.1), or endometrial cancer (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.3-2.7). CONCLUSION: Raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism, but there was no increased risk for cataracts, gallbladder disease, endometrial hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on animal models of schizophrenia. METHODS: Seventy Swiss albino female mice (25-35 g) were divided into 4 groups: amphetamine-free (control), amphetamine, 50, and 100 mg/kg DHEA. The DHEA was administered intraperitoneally (ip) for 5 days. Amphetamine (3 mg/kg ip) induced hyper locomotion, apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously [sc]) induced climbing, and haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg sc) induced catalepsy tests were used as animal models of schizophrenia. The study was conducted at the Animal Experiment Laboratories, Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey between March and May 2012. Statistical analysis was carried out using Kruskal-Wallis test for hyper locomotion, and one-way ANOVA for climbing and catalepsy tests. RESULTS: In the amphetamine-induced locomotion test, there were significant increases in all movements compared with the amphetamine-free group. Both DHEA 50 mg/kg (p<0.05), and 100 mg/kg (p<0.01) significantly decreased all movements compared with the amphetamine-induced locomotion group. There was a significant difference between groups in the haloperidol-induced catalepsy test (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between groups in terms of total climbing time in the apomorphine-induced climbing test (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: We observed that DHEA reduced locomotor activity and increased catalepsy at both doses, while it had no effect on climbing behavior. We suggest that DHEA displays typical neuroleptic-like effects, and may be used in the treatment of schizophrenia.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and tolerability of clonidine used alone or with methylphenidate in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHOD: In a 16-week multicenter, double-blind trial, 122 children with ADHD were randomly assigned to clonidine (n = 31), methylphenidate (n = 29), clonidine and methylphenidate (n = 32), or placebo (n = 30). Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0.6 mg/day for clonidine and 60 mg/day for methylphenidate (both with divided dosing). Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs. RESULTS: There were more incidents of bradycardia in subjects treated with clonidine compared with those not treated with clonidine (17.5% versus 3.4%; p =.02), but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes. There were no suggestions of interactions between clonidine and methylphenidate regarding cardiovascular outcomes. Moderate or severe adverse events were more common in subjects on clonidine (79.4% versus 49.2%; p =.0006) but not associated with higher rates of early study withdrawal. Drowsiness was common on clonidine, but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Clonidine, used alone or with methylphenidate, appears safe and well tolerated in childhood ADHD. Physicians prescribing clonidine should monitor for bradycardia and advise patients about the high likelihood of initial drowsiness.
OBJECTIVE: To present a case of fluconazole-associated torsade de pointes (TDP) and discuss fluconazole's role in causing TDP. CASE SUMMARY: A 68-year-old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed TDP eight days after commencing oral fluconazole The patient had no other risk factors for TDP, including coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the initiation of fluconazole and TDP. The TDP resolved when fluconazole was discontinued; however, the patient continued to have premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) until six days after drug cessation DISCUSSION: Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of fluconazole and the development of TDP. The possible mechanism is depression of rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents. In our patient, there was no other etiology identified that could explain QT prolongation or TDP The complete disappearance of NSVT and premature ventricular contractions followed by normalization of QT interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests fluconazole as the etiology. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that fluconazole, even at low doses, may cause prolongation of the QT interval, leading to TDP. Serial electrocardiographic monitoring may be considered when fluconazole is administered in patients who are at risk for ventricular arrhythmias.
OBJECTIVE: To report 2 cases of ticlopidine-induced cholestatic hepatitis, investigate its mechanism, and compare the observed main characteristics with those of the published cases. CASE SUMMARIES: Two patients developed prolonged cholestatic hepatitis after receiving ticlopidine following percutaneous coronary angioplasty, with complete remission during the follow-up period. T-cell stimulation by therapeutic concentration of ticlopidine was demonstrated in vitro in the patients, but not in healthy controls. DISCUSSION: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent ticlopidine; several cases have been reported but few in the English literature. Our patients developed jaundice following treatment with ticlopidine and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cholestatic hepatitis, which resolved after discontinuation of the drug. Hepatitis may develop weeks after discontinuation of the drug and may run a prolonged course, but complete remission was observed in all reported cases. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probably related to the use of ticlopidine. The mechanisms of this ticlopidine-induced cholestasis are unclear. Immune mechanisms may be involved in the drug's hepatotoxicity, as suggested by the T-cell stimulation study reported here. CONCLUSIONS: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare adverse effect of ticlopidine that may be immune mediated. Patients receiving the drug should be monitored with liver function tests along with complete blood cell counts. This complication will be observed even less often in the future as ticlopidine is being replaced by the newer antiplatelet agent clopidogrel.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of a severe interaction between simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir resulting in rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. BACKGROUND: A 72-year-old white man with underlying human immunodeficiency virus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia presented with generalized pain, fatigue, and dark orange urine for 3 days. The patient was taking 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime (initiated 27 days earlier); amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily (initiated 19 days earlier); and 400 mg atazanavir daily (initiated at least 2 years previously). Laboratory evaluation revealed 66,680 U/L creatine kinase, 93 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 4.6 mg/dL creatinine, 1579 U/L aspartate aminotransferase, and 738 U/L alanine aminotransferase. Simvastatin, amiodarone, and the patient's human immunodeficiency virus medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis. Nine days later the patient's creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 U/L and creatinine was 3.3 mg/dL. The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered. DISCUSSION: The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4. Amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions. In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions; atorvastatin carries moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of acute cholestatic hepatitis following exposure to the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane. CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old healthy woman from Iraq developed acute cholestatic hepatitis 3 weeks following repair of the right rotator cuff under general anesthesia. There was no evidence for viral, autoimmune, or metabolic causes of hepatitis. No other medications were involved except for dipyrone for analgesia. The alanine aminotransferase was elevated to a peak concentration of 1533 U/L and the serum bilirubin reached a peak of 17.0 mg/dL. There was slow improvement over 4 months. Accidental reexposure by the patient to dipyrone was uneventful. DISCUSSION: The clinical and histologic picture of this case resembles halothane hepatitis, which has a significant mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane, a common anesthetic agent, can cause severe cholestatic hepatitis.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of central retinal vein occlusion associated with clomiphene citrate (CC). DESIGN: Case study. SETTING: Ophthalmology clinic of an academic hospital. PATIENT(S): A 36-year-old woman referred from the infertility clinic for blurred vision. INTERVENTION(S): Ophthalmic examination after CC therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Central retinal vein occlusion after ovulation induction with CC. RESULT(S): A 36-year-old Chinese woman developed central retinal vein occlusion after eight courses of CC. A search of the literature on the thromboembolic complications of CC does not include this severe ophthalmic complication, although mild visual disturbance after CC intake is not uncommon. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first reported case of central retinal vein occlusion after treatment with CC. Extra caution is warranted in treating infertility patients with CC, and patients should be well informed of this side effect before commencement of therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of erythema multiforme and hypersensitivity myocarditis caused by ampicillin. CASE SUMMARY: A 13-year-old boy was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin because of suspected septicemia. Medications were discontinued when erythema multiforme and congestive heart failure caused by myocarditis occurred. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone and gradually improved. Macrophage-migration inhibition (MIF) test with ampicillin was positive. DISCUSSION: After most infections causing erythema multiforme and myocarditis were ruled out, a drug-induced allergic reaction was suspected. Positive MIF test for ampicillin showed sensitization of the patient's lymphocytes to ampicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Hypersensitivity myocarditis is a rare and dangerous manifestation of allergy to penicillins.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of fatal liver failure possibly associated with concurrent use of bupropion and carbimazole. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old Chinese man with a history of hyperthyroidism had been treated with carbimazole and propranolol for the past 5 years. He received a 10-day course of bupropion as an aid for smoking cessation 10 weeks prior to presentation. He developed acute liver failure with rapid deterioration of renal function. Liver biopsy showed evidence of nonspecific drug-induced acute liver injury. His condition was further complicated by sepsis and coagulopathy. Death resulted 19 days after the onset of symptoms. The likelihood that bupropion induced hepatotoxicity in our patient was possible, based on the Naranjo probability scale. DISCUSSION: Although there is increasing evidence of hepatotoxicity induced by bupropion, this is the first case of fatality that could have resulted from acute liver failure in a patient receiving bupropion while on concomitant treatment with carbimazole. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of acute liver insult induced by bupropion given concurrently with other hepatotoxic drugs.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia with suspected MSSA meningitis treated with high-dose daptomycin assessed with concurrent serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations. CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old male presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness and presumed health-care-associated pneumonia shown on chest radiograph. Treatment was empirically initiated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Blood cultures revealed S. aureus susceptible to oxacillin. Empiric antibiotic treatment was narrowed to nafcillin on day 4. On day 8, the patient developed acute renal failure (serum creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, increased from 1.2 mg/dL the previous day and 0.8 mg/dL on admission). The patient's Glasgow Coma Score was 3, with normal findings shown on computed tomography scan of the head 72 hours following an episode of cardiac arrest on day 10. The patient experienced relapsing MSSA bacteremia on day 9, increasing the suspicion for a central nervous system (CNS) infection. Nafcillin was discontinued and daptomycin 9 mg/kg daily was initiated for suspected meningitis and was continued until the patient's death on day 16. Daptomycin serum and CSF trough concentrations were 11.21 ug/mL and 0.52 ug/mL, respectively, prior to the third dose. Lumbar puncture results were inconclusive and no further blood cultures were positive for MSSA. Creatine kinase levels were normal prior to daptomycin therapy and were not reassessed. DISCUSSION: Daptomycin was initiated in our patient secondary to possible nafcillin-induced acute interstitial nephritis and relapsing bacteremia. At a dose of 9 mg/kg, resultant penetration of 5% was higher than in previous reports, more consistent with inflamed meninges. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose daptomycin may be an alternative option for MSSA bacteremia with or without a CNS source in patients who have failed or cannot tolerate standard therapy. Further clinical evaluation in patients with confirmed meningitis is warranted.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of multiple episodes of seizure activity in an AIDS patent following amphotericin B infusion. CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old African-American man experienced recurrent grand mal seizures during intravenous infusion of amphotericin B, then petit mal seizures as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time. The patients concurrent medications included didanosine, hydroxyzine, promethazine, hydrocortisone, and prochlorperazine. Despite administration of phenytoin and lorazepam, the seizures persisted and occurred only during amphotercin B administration. DISCUSSION: AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis, both of which the patient had, can potentially cause seizures. The patient had a history of alcohol abuse; alcohol intake as well as withdrawal can also cause seizures. Didanosine also has a potential for inducing seizures. However, these other potential causes of seizure were ruled out. The time course of events suggested that amphotericin B was the cause of the seizures in this AIDS patient. CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B seems to be the probable cause of the seizures. To date, only three cases of seizures associated with amphotericin B have been reported in the literature, but healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for this rare adverse effect.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of persistent hiccups associated by azithromycin therapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old man presented with persistent hiccups after beginning azithromycin for the treatment of pharyngitis. Hiccups were persistent and exhausting. Discontinuation of azithromycin and therapy with baclofen finally resolved hiccups. No organic cause of hiccups was identified despite extensive investigation. DISCUSSION: Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with hiccups. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone and methylprednisolone), benzodiazepines (midazolam) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of hiccups. Few cases of drug-induced hiccups have been reported related to macrolide antimicrobials. Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible (score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other macrolides and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups. Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by azithromycin could be the pathogenesis of hiccups in our patient. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of drug-induced hiccups is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination. However, macrolide antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with hiccups and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side-effect.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion associated with desvenlafaxine. CASE SUMMARY: A 57-year old female with hyponatraemia. Her medications included desvenlafaxine, and symptoms included nausea, anxiety and confusion. The serum sodium at this time was 120 mmol/L, serum osmolality was 263 mosmol/kg, urine osmolality 410 mosmol/kg and urine sodium 63 mmol/L, consistent with a diagnosis of SIADH. Desvenlafaxine was ceased and fluid restriction implemented. After 4 days the sodium increased to 128 mmol/L and fluid restriction was relaxed. During her further 3 weeks inpatient admission the serum sodium ranged from 134 to 137 mmol/L during treatment with mirtazapine. DISCUSSION: SIADH has been widely reported with a range of antidepressants. This case report suggests that desvenlafaxine might cause clinically significant hyponatremia. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the potential for antidepressants to cause hyponatremia,and take appropriate corrective action where necessary.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of venlafaxine overdose. CASE SUMMARY: A 40-year-old woman with major depression took an overdose of venlafaxine in an apparent suicide attempt. After the ingestion of 26 venlafaxine 50-mg tablets, the patient experienced a witnessed generalized seizure. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, venlafaxine was discontinued, and no further sequelae were seen. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of venlafaxine overdose that resulted in a generalized seizure. Based on nonoverdose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of venlafaxine and the potential risks of available interventions, no emergent therapy was instituted. CONCLUSIONS: The venlafaxine overdose in our patient resulted in a single episode of generalized seizure but elicited no further sequelae.
OBJECTIVE: To report the incidence and management of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with uveitis treated with the fluocinolone acetonide (FA) intravitreal implant. DESIGN: Pooled data from 3 multicenter, double-masked, randomized, controlled, phase 2b/3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 0.59-mg or 2.1-mg FA intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed. RESULTS: During the 3-year follow-up, 71.0% of implanted eyes had an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or more than baseline and 55.1%, 24.7%, and 6.2% of eyes reached an IOP of 30 mm Hg or more, 40 mm Hg or more, and 50 mm Hg or more, respectively. Topical IOP-lowering medication was administered in 74.8% of implanted eyes, and IOP-lowering surgeries, most of which were trabeculectomies (76.2%), were performed on 36.6% of implanted eyes. Intraocular pressure-lowering surgeries were considered a success (postoperative IOP of 6-21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP-lowering medication) in 85.1% of eyes at 1 year. The rate of hypotony (IOP </= 5 mm Hg) following IOP-lowering surgery (42.5%) was not different from that of implanted eyes not subjected to surgery (35.4%) (P = .09). CONCLUSION: Elevated IOP is a significant complication with the FA intravitreal implant but may be controlled with medication and surgery.
OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of a possible adverse interaction between clonidine and verapamil resulting in atrioventricular (AV) block in both patients and severe hypotension in one patient. CASE SUMMARIES: A 54-year-old woman with hyperaldosteronism was treated with verapamil 480 mg/d and spironolactone 100 mg/d. After the addition of a minimal dose of clonidine (0.15 mg bid), she developed complete AV block and severe hypotension, which resolved upon cessation of all medications. A 65-year-old woman was treated with extended-release verapamil 240 mg/d. After the addition of clonidine 0.15 mg bid she developed complete AV block, which resolved after all therapy was stopped. DISCUSSION: An adverse interaction between clonidine and verapamil has not been reported previously. We describe two such cases and discuss the various mechanisms that might cause such an interaction. Clinicians should be acquainted with this possibly fatal interaction between two commonly used antihypertensive drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Caution is recommended in combining clonidine and verapamil therapy, even in patients who do not have sinus or AV node dysfunction. The two drugs may act synergistically on both the AV node and the peripheral circulation.
OBJECTIVE: To review the natural history and ocular and systemic adverse effects of patients taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate who attended an ophthalmic screening program. DESIGN: Retrospective study. RESULTS: Records of 262 patients who were taking hydroxychloroquine and screened in the Department of Ophthalmology were reviewed. Of the 262 patients, 14 (18%) of 76 who had stopped treatment at the time of the study experienced documented adverse effects. Systemic adverse effects occurred in 8 patients (10.5%) and ocular adverse effects, in 5 (6.5%). Thirty-five patients (13.4%) had visual field abnormalities, which were attributed to hydroxychloroquine treatment in 4 patients (1.5%). Three of the 4 patients were taking less than 6.5 mg/kg per day and all patients had normal renal and liver function test results. CONCLUSIONS: The current study used a protocol of visual acuity and color vision assessment, funduscopy, and Humphrey 10-2 visual field testing and shows that visual field defects appeared before any corresponding changes in any other tested clinical parameters; the defects were reproducible and the test parameters were reliable. Patients taking hydroxychloroquine can demonstrate a toxic reaction in the retina despite the absence of known risk factors. Screening, including Humphrey 10-2 visual field assessment, is recommended 2 years after the initial baseline and yearly thereafter.
OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of folic acid-containing multivitamin supplementation in epileptic women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural birth defects and epilepsy-related side effects. STUDY DESIGN: First a randomised trial, later periconception care including in total 12225 females. RESULTS: Of 60 epileptic women with periconceptional folic acid (0.8 mg)-containing multivitamin supplementation, no one developed epilepsy-related side effects during the periconception period. One epileptic woman delivered a newborn with cleft lip and palate. Another patient exhibited with a cluster of seizures after the periconception period using another multivitamin. This 22-year-old epileptic woman was treated continuously by carbamazepine and a folic acid (1 mg)-containing multivitamin from the 20th week of gestation. She developed status epilepticus and later symptoms of systemic lupus erythematodes. Her pregnancy ended with stillbirth. CONCLUSIONS: The epileptic pregnant patient's autoimmune disease (probably drug-induced lupus) could damage the blood-brain barrier, therefore the therapeutic dose (> or =1 mg) of folic acid triggered a cluster of seizures. Physiological dose (<1 mg) of folic acid both in healthy and 60 epileptic women, all without any autoimmune disease, did not increase the risk for epileptic seizures.
OBJECTIVE: To study tremor side effects of salbutamol an easily applicable, quick and low-priced method is needed. A new method using a commercially available, pen-shaped laser pointer was developed. Aim of the study was to determine sensitivity, reproducibility, reference values and the agreement with a questionnaire. METHODS: Tremor was measured using a laser pointer technique. To determine sensitivity we assessed tremor in 44 patients with obstructive lung disease after administration of cumulative doses of salbutamol. Subjects were asked to aim at the centre of a target, subdivided in concentric circles, from 5 m distance. The circle in which the participant succeeded to aim was recorded in millimetres radius. In another series of measurements, reproducibility and reference values of the tremor was assessed in 65 healthy subjects in three sessions, at 9 a.m., 4 p.m. and 9 a.m., respectively, 1 week later. Postural tremor was measured with the arm horizontally outstretched rest tremor with the arm supported by an armrest and finally tremor was measured after holding a 2-kg weight until exhaustion. Inter-observer variability was measured in a series of 10 healthy subjects. Tremor was measured simultaneously by two independent observers. RESULTS: Salbutamol significantly increased tremor severity in patients in a dose-dependent way. Within healthy adults no age-dependency could be found (b = 0.262 mm/year; P = 0.72). There was no agreement between the questionnaire and tremor severity (r = 0.093; P = 0.53). Postural tremor showed no significant difference between the first and third session (P = 0.07). Support of the arm decreased tremor severity, exhaustion increased tremor severity significantly. A good agreement was found between two independent observers (interclass correlation coefficient 0.72). DISCUSSION: Quantifying tremor by using an inexpensive laser pointer is, with the exception of children (<12 years) a sensitive and reproducible method.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that, in lifetime captopril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the hypertensive effect of dietary sodium chloride supplementation. METHODS: Male SHR (aged 6 weeks) that had been treated from conception onward with either captopril or vehicle remained on a basal sodium chloride diet or were fed a high sodium chloride diet. After 2 weeks, the rats were subjected to ganglionic blockade and 2 days later, an infusion of clonidine. RESULTS: Lifetime captopril treatment significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in both groups. Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the dietary sodium chloride-induced increase in MAP in both groups. Infusion of the central nervous system alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine also resulted in a greater reduction in MAP in both groups of SHR that were fed the high (compared with the basal) sodium chloride diet. CONCLUSIONS: In both lifetime captopril-treated and control SHR, the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the pressor effects of a high sodium chloride diet.
OBJECTIVE: We describe the unique CT features of ureteric calculi in six HIV-infected patients receiving indinavir, the most commonly used HIV protease inhibitor, which is associated with an increased incidence of urolithiasis. CONCLUSION: Ureteric obstruction caused by precipitated indinavir crystals may be difficult to diagnose with unenhanced CT. The calculi are not opaque, and secondary signs of obstruction may be absent or minimal and should be sought carefully. Images may need to be obtained using i.v. contrast material to enable diagnosis of ureteric stones or obstruction in patients with HIV infection who receive indinavir therapy.
OBJECTIVE: We wanted to test whether assessment of both a central pain-related signal (chemo-somatosensory evoked potential, CSSEP) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal (negative mucosal potential, NMP) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs. For this purpose, experimental conditions were created in which NSAIDs had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and tonic pain by either central or peripheral mechanisms. METHODS: According to a double-blind, randomised, controlled, threefold cross-over design, 18 healthy subjects (11 males, 7 females; mean age 26 years) received either placebo, 400 mg ibuprofen, or 800 mg ibuprofen. Phasic pain was applied by means of short pulses of CO2 to the nasal mucosa (stimulus duration 500 ms, interval approximately 60 s), and tonic pain was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature, humidity and flow rate (22 degrees C, 0% relative humidity, 145 ml.s-1). Both CSSEPs as central and NMPs as peripheral correlates of pain were obtained in response to the CO2 stimuli. Additionally, the subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and tonic pain by means of visual analogue scales. RESULTS: As described earlier, administration of ibuprofen was followed by a decrease in tonic pain but-relative to placebo-an increase in correlates of phasic pain, indicating a specific effect of ibuprofen on the interaction between the pain stimuli under these special experimental conditions. Based on the similar behaviour of CSSEP and NMP, it was concluded that the pharmacological process underlying this phenomenon was localised in the periphery. By means of the simultaneous recording of interrelated peripheral and central electrophysiologic correlates of nociception, it was possible to separate central and peripheral effects of an NSAID. The major advantage of this pain model is the possibility of obtaining peripheral pain-related activity directly using a non-invasive technique in humans.
OBJECTIVES A Japanese family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was investigated for a sequence alteration in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27). The expression of CYP27 has been mostly explored using cultured fibroblasts, prompting the examination of the transcripts from blood leucocytes as a simple and rapid technique. METHODS An alteration in CYP27 of the proband was searched for by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and subsequent sequencing. Samples of RNA were subjected to reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and the product of the proband was amplified with nested primers and sequenced. RESULTS A homozygous G to A transition at the 5 end of intron 7 was detected in the patient. In RT-PCR analysis, only a truncated transcript was detected in the patient, whereas both normal and truncated transcripts were detected in the siblings. The sequencing of the patients cDNA fragment disclosed a direct conjuction of exon 6 and exon 8. CONCLUSION The mutation at splice donor site and the truncation of mRNA were identical with those of a recently reported Italian patient, although different in symptomatology. The application of blood leucocytes can be a simple technique on analysing a constructive abnormality of CYP27 mRNA..
OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections into the thyroarytenoid muscles are the current standard of care for adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD). Reported adverse effects include a period of breathiness, throat pain, and difficulty with swallowing liquids. Here we report multiple cases of bilateral abductor paralysis following Botox injections for ADSD, a complication previously unreported. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Patients that received Botox injections for spasmodic dysphonia between January 2000 and October 2009 were evaluated. Patients with ADSD were identified. The number of treatments received and adverse effects were noted. For patients with bilateral abductor paralysis, age, sex, paralytic Botox dose, prior Botox dose, and course following paralysis were noted. RESULTS: From a database of 452 patients receiving Botox, 352 patients had been diagnosed with ADSD. Of these 352 patients, eight patients suffered bilateral abductor paralysis, and two suffered this complication twice. All affected patients were females over the age of 50 years. Most patients had received treatments prior to abductor paralysis and continued receiving after paralysis. Seven patients recovered after a brief period of activity restrictions, and one underwent a tracheotomy. The incidence of abductor paralysis after Botox injection for ADSD was 0.34%. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral abductor paralysis is a rare complication of Botox injections for ADSD, causing difficulty with breathing upon exertion. The likely mechanism of paralysis is diffusion of Botox around the muscular process of the arytenoid to the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles. The paralysis is temporary, and watchful waiting with restriction of activity is the recommended management.
OBJECTIVES: It has been well documented that although homozygosity of the variant aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) gene allele, ALDH2*2, in Asians almost fully protects against alcoholism, the heterozygosity only affords a partial protection to varying degrees. The full protection against alcoholism has been ascribed to the low-amount of alcohol hypersensitivity accompanied by a prolonged and large accumulation of acetaldehyde in blood (Peng et al. Pharmacogenetics 1999; 9:463-476). The physiological basis for the partial protection, however, remains unclear. METHODS: To address this question, we recruited a total of 32 adult Han Chinese men, matched by age, body-mass index, and nutritional state from a population base of 404 men. The subjects were divided into 3 combinatorial genotypic groups of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and ALDH, that is, ALDH2*1/*1-ADH1B*1/*1-ADH1C*1/*1 (n=8), ALDH2*1/*1-ADH1B*2/*2-ADH1C*1/*1 (n=8), and ALDH2*1/*2-ADH1B*2/*2-ADH1C*1/*1 (n=16). Following a moderate dose of ethanol (0.5 g/kg body weight), blood ethanol/acetaldehyde/acetate concentrations, cardiac and extracranial/intracranial arterial hemodynamic parameters, as well as self-rated subjective sensations, were measured for 130 min. RESULTS: Heterozygotic ALDH2*1/*2 subjects were found to be strikingly responsive to the moderate amount of alcohol, as evidenced by the prominent cardiovascular effects as well as subjective perceptions of general discomfort for as long as 2 h following ingestion. The ADH1B polymorphisms did not appear to correlate with the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that acetaldehyde, rather than ethanol or acetate, is primarily responsible for the observed alcohol sensitivity reactions and suggest that substantially lower accumulation of blood acetaldehyde in the heterozygotes significantly reduces the aversion reaction to low amounts of alcohol that permits other biological as well as environmental factors to facilitate drinking and the according risk for the disease.
OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). These symptoms may be due to 'sensitisation' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state. The levodopa-treated MPTP-lesioned marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients. Here we compare the time course of levodopa-induced motor fluctuations and neuropsychiatric-like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms. METHODS: Marmosets were administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2.0 mg/kg s.c.) for five days, resulting in stable parkinsonism. Levodopa (15 mg/kg and benserazide, 3.75 mg/kg) p.o. b.i.d, was administered for 30 days. Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability, dyskinesia and on-time (motor fluctuations) and neuropsychiatric-like behaviors on Day 0 (prior to levodopa) and on Days 1, 7, 13, 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater, blind to the treatment day. RESULTS: The neuropsychiatric-like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds. As anticipated, animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa-induced motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and wearing-off, that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy. In contrast, levodopa-induced neuropsychiatric-like behaviors were present on Day 1 of levodopa treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in PD are more likely an interaction between levodopa and the disease state than a consequence of sensitisation to repeated dopaminergic therapy.
OBJECTIVES: Nine different functional UGT1A enzymes are generated from a single UGT1A gene by alternative splicing, with each enzyme having a unique exon 1. SN-38, the active metabolite of the anticancer agent irinotecan, is metabolized by both UGT1A1 and UGT1A9. We aim to characterize the UGT1A9-UGT1A1 haplotypes in Asians and Caucasians and gain insights on their functional consequences. METHODS: Asian and Caucasian individuals were genotyped for UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 variants. RESULTS: A higher frequency of the UGT1A9 -118T10 allele was observed in Asians compared to Caucasians, while the -275T>A and -2152C>T variants were relatively uncommon in Caucasians and not found in Asians. The strongest linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed between the UGT1A1 -53 and -3156 and between the UGT1A9 -275 and -2152 loci. Lower LD was observed between the -118 UGT1A9 variant and the UGT1A1 variants. Fourteen UGT1A9-UGT1A1 haplotypes were found in Asians, seven of them found to be shared by both populations. Common UGT1A9-UGT1A1 diplotypes were defined, and a difference was observed across the SN-38 glucuronidation rates in Caucasian livers stratified by diplotypes. CONCLUSION: This study for the first time described common UGT1A9-UGT1A1 haplotypes, highlighting important ethnic differences between Asians and Caucasians. If the functional effect of these haplotypes can be confirmed, this haplotypic information would be applicable to the correct design of prospective clinical studies of irinotecan, as well as of other drugs primarily metabolized by both UGT1A1 and UGT1A9.
OBJECTIVES: Posterior leukoencephalopathy due to calcineurin-inhibitor-related neurotoxicity is a rare but severe complication that results from treatment with immunosuppressive agents (primarily those administered after a liver or kidney transplant). The pathophysiologic mechanisms of that disorder remain unknown. CASE: We report the case of a 46-year-old woman who received a liver transplant in our center as treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis and in whom either a fulminant course of posterior leukoencephalopathy or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome developed 110 days after transplant. After an initially uneventful course after the transplant, the patient rapidly fell into deep coma. RESULTS: Cerebral MRI scan showed typical signs of enhancement in the pontine and posterior regions. Switching the immunosuppressive regimen from tacrolimus to cyclosporine did not improve the clinical situation. The termination of treatment with any calcineurin inhibitor resulted in a complete resolution of that complication. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after liver transplant is rare. We recommend a complete cessation of any calcineurin inhibitor rather than a dose reduction.
OBJECTIVES: Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha-2b/ribavirin compared with interferon-alpha monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia (RIHA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health-care costs and management of RIHA during treatment of CHC in a clinical trial setting. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of RIHA. Decision-analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating RIHA. Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: RIHA, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g/L, occurs in approximately 7% to 9% of patients treated with combination therapy. The standard of care for management of RIHA is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage. We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA to be 170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48-week treatment course (range 68- 692). The results of the one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from 57 to 317. In comparison, the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is 16,459. CONCLUSIONS: The direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA is 1% ( 170/ 16,459) of drug treatment costs. Questions remain about the optimal dose of ribavirin and the incidence of RIHA in a real-world population. Despite these uncertainties, this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating RIHA provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect.
OBJECTIVES: SLCO1B1*5 and SLCO1B1*15 have been reported to reduce the clearance of pravastatin in healthy volunteers. However, there remains controversy in the effects of SLCO1B1*5 on the activity of OATP1B1 in vitro. In addition, the effect of SLCO1B1*15 on the function of OATP1B1 has not been studied using cDNA-expression systems. Object of the present study was to study the influence of SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G, a novel haplotype found in a patient with pravastatin-induced myopathy, on the functional properties of OATP1B1 by transient expression systems of HEK293 and HeLa cells using endogenous conjugates and statins as substrates. METHODS: Transporting assays for endogenous substrates were performed using tritium labeled estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide and estrone-3-sulfate. Quantitation of pravastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin and simvastatin were carried out using HPLC tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The transporting activities of cells expressing SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G decreased significantly but those of SLCO1B1*1b, *1a+C1007G and *1b+C1007G were not altered for all of the substrates tested except for simvastatin. Kinetic analysis of pravastatin and atorvastatin showed that Km values were not altered but Vmax values decreased significantly in cells expressing SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G. Immunocytochemical study showed that SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G proteins are localized not only at the plasma membrane but also in the intracellular space. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that 521T>C, existing commonly in SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G, is the key single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that determines the functional properties of SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G allelic proteins and that decreased activities of these variant proteins are mainly caused by a sorting error produced by this SNP.
OBJECTIVES: Simultaneous abuse of cocaine and ethanol affects 12 million Americans annually. In combination, these substances are substantially more toxic than either drug alone. Their combined cardiac toxicity may be due to independent effects of each drug; however, they may also be due to cocaethylene (CE), a cocaine metabolite formed only in the presence of ethanol. The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of CE in the combined cardiotoxicity of cocaine and ethanol in a model simulating their abuse. METHODS: Twenty-three dogs were randomized to receive either 1) three intravenous (IV) boluses of cocaine 7.5 mg/kg with ethanol (1 g/kg) as an IV infusion (C+E, n = 8), 2) three cocaine boluses only (C, n = 6), 3) ethanol infusion only (E, n = 5), or 4) placebo boluses and infusion (n = 4). Hemodynamic measurements, electrocardiograms, and serum drug concentrations were obtained at baseline, and then at fixed time intervals after each drug was administered. RESULTS: Two of eight dogs in the C+E group experienced cardiovascular collapse. The most dramatic hemodynamic changes occurred after each cocaine bolus in the C+E and C only groups; however, persistent hemodynamic changes occurred in the C+E group. Peak CE levels were associated with a 45% (SD +/- 22%, 95% CI = 22% to 69%) decrease in cardiac output (p < 0.05), a 56% (SD +/- 23%, 95% CI = 32% to 80%) decrease in dP/dt(max) (p <.006), and a 23% (SD +/- 15%, 95% CI = 7% to 49%) decrease in SVO(2) (p < 0.025). Ventricular arrhythmias were primarily observed in the C+E group, in which four of eight dogs experienced ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine and ethanol in combination were more toxic than either substance alone. Co-administration resulted in prolonged cardiac toxicity and was dysrhythmogenic. Peak serum cocaethylene concentrations were associated with prolonged myocardial depression.
OBJECTIVES: The United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Research Group (UKPDRG) trial found an increased mortality in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) randomized to receive 10 mg selegiline per day and L-dopa compared with those taking L-dopa alone. Recently, we found that therapy with selegiline and L-dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline. This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure. The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension. METHODS: The cardiovascular responses to standing and head-up tilt were studied repeatedly in PD patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn. RESULTS: Head-up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures. A lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing. Orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug. Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action. CONCLUSION: This study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with L-dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypotension. The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non-selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of amphetamine and metamphetamine are discussed.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of amiodarone in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker. BACKGROUND: Reports of severe bradyarrhythmia during amiodarone therapy are infrequent and limited to studies assessing the therapy's use in the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS: A study cohort of 8,770 patients age > or =65 years with a new diagnosis of AF was identified from a provincewide database of Quebec residents with a myocardial infarction (MI) between 1991 and 1999. Using a nested case-control design, 477 cases of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker were matched (1:4) to 1,908 controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of pacemaker insertion associated with amiodarone use, controlling for baseline risk factors and exposure to sotalol, Class I antiarrhythmic agents, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. RESULTS: amiodarone use was associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (OR: 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30 to 3.54). This effect was modified by gender, with a greater risk in women versus men (OR: 3.86, 95% CI: 1.70 to 8.75 vs. OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 0.80 to 2.89). Digoxin was the only other medication associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.31). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the use of amiodarone in elderly patients with AF and a previous MI increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker. The finding of an augmented risk of pacemaker insertion in elderly women receiving amiodarone requires further investigation.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between APOE epsilon4 and subjective effects of trihexyphenidyl on measures reflecting sedation and confusion and to investigate the relationship between trihexyphenidyl-induced subjective effects and objective memory performance. METHODS: This study comprised 24 cognitively intact, health elderly adults (12 APOE epsilon4 carriers) at an outpatient geriatric psychiatry research clinic. This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, three-way, crossover experimental design. All participants received 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg trihexyphenidyl or placebo administered in counterbalanced sequences over a period of three consecutive weeks. Bond and Lader's visual analog scales and alternate versions of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test were administered in a repeated measures design at baseline, 1, 2.5, and 5 hours postdrug administration. RESULTS: A 2.0-mg oral dose of trihexyphenidyl resulted in increased subjective ratings of mental slowness in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only. Drug effects as determined by difference scores between 2.0 mg trihexyphenidyl and placebo on ratings of mental slowness significantly correlated with total and delayed recall on the Buschke Selective Reminding Test in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only. However, no significant effects were found with other visual analog scales reflecting subjective sedation and clear-headedness. CONCLUSION: The epsilon4 allele in healthy elderly was associated with increased subjective mental slowing after trihexyphenidyl anticholinergic challenge.
OBJECTIVES: The risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with COX-2 inhibitors may offset their gastrointestinal (GI) benefit compared with non-selective (NS) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We aimed to compare the risks of hospitalization for AMI and GI bleeding among elderly patients using COX-2 inhibitors, NS-NSAIDs and acetaminophen. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data of patients > or =65 years of age who filled a prescription for NSAID or acetaminophen during 1999-2002. Outcomes were compared using Cox regression models with time-dependent exposures. RESULTS: Person-years of exposure among non-users of aspirin were: 75,761 to acetaminophen, 42,671 to rofecoxib 65,860 to celecoxib, and 37,495 to NS-NSAIDs. Among users of aspirin, they were: 14,671 to rofecoxib, 22,875 to celecoxib, 9,832 to NS-NSAIDs and 38,048 to acetaminophen. Among non-users of aspirin, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of hospitalization for AMI/GI vs the acetaminophen (with no aspirin) group were: rofecoxib 1.27 (1.13, 1.42), celecoxib 0.93 (0.83, 1.03), naproxen 1.59 (1.31, 1.93), diclofenac 1.17 (0.99, 1.38) and ibuprofen 1.05 (0.74, 1.51). Among users of aspirin, they were: rofecoxib 1.73 (1.52, 1.98), celecoxib 1.34 (1.19, 1.52), ibuprofen 1.51 (0.95, 2.41), diclofenac 1.69 (1.35, 2.10), naproxen 1.35 (0.97, 1.88) and acetaminophen 1.29 (1.17, 1.42). CONCLUSION: Among non-users of aspirin, naproxen seemed to carry the highest risk for AMI/GI bleeding. The AMI/GI toxicity of celecoxib was similar to that of acetaminophen and seemed to be better than those of rofecoxib and NS-NSAIDs. Among users of aspirin, both celecoxib and naproxen seemed to be the least toxic.
OBJECTIVES: Thrombotic microangiopathy is a well-known problem in patients following renal transplantation. In postrenal transplantation, thrombotic microangiopathy is often a reflection of hemolytic uremic syndrome. We aimed to determine the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1-year period, from June 2003 to June 2004, at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies (n=25) performed during this interval. Pre- and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible. RESULTS: Five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found. Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital, while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow-up. Three cases were related to cyclosporine, and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. CONCLUSIONS: In the literature, the most-frequent cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Other causes include drug-related (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) toxicity, procoagulant status, and antibody-mediated rejection. We found that the most-frequent cause of thrombotic microangiopathy was drug related, secondary mainly to cyclosporine. In the current study, the frequency of thrombotic microangiopathy was similar to the percentage reported in the literature (20%).
OBJECTIVES: To assess changes induced by lithium maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid, parathyroid and ion alterations. These were evaluated with respect to the duration of lithium therapy, age, sex, and family history (whether or not the patient had a first-degree relative with thyroid disease). DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Affective Disorders Clinic at St. Mary's Hospital, Montreal. PATIENTS: One hundred and one patients (28 men and 73 women) with bipolar disorder receiving lithium maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year's to 32 years' duration. The control group consisted of 82 patients with no psychiatric or endocrinological diagnoses from the hospital's out-patient clinics. OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory analyses of calcium, magnesium and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning lithium therapy and at biannual follow-up. RESULTS: Hypothyroidism developed in 40 patients, excluding 8 patients who were hypothyroid at baseline. All patients having first-degree relatives affected by thyroid illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism (3.7 years after onset of lithium therapy) compared with patients without a family history (8.6 years after onset of lithium therapy). Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by hypothyroidism than women under 60 years of age (34.6% versus 31.9%). Magnesium levels in patients on lithium treatment were unchanged from baseline levels. After lithium treatment, calcium levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels. Thus, lithium treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma calcium levels associated with aging. CONCLUSIONS: Familial thyroid illness is a risk factor for hypothyroidism and hypercalcemia during lithium therapy.
OBJECTIVES: To assess patients' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with propofol, and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as measured by bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. METHODS: This was a prospective, single-intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with propofol between December 28, 2002, and October 31, 2003. BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status. At 1-minute intervals during the procedural sedation, until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure, a word from a standardized list was read aloud, and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator. The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient's ability to repeat the word were recorded. After the procedure, the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall, and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed. RESULTS: Seventy-five consenting patients were enrolled; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation. No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations. The mean (+/-standard deviation) time of data collection was 16.4 minutes (+/-7.1; range 5 to 34 minutes). The mean initial (preprocedure) BIS score was 97.1 (+/-2.3; range 92 to 99). The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66.9 (+/-14.4; range 33 to 91). The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77.1 (95% CI = 74.3 to 80.0). The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the inability to repeat words was 81.5 (95% CI = 78.1 to 84.8). The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96.7 (+/-2.4; range 84 to 98). The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91.2 (95% CI = 88.1 to 94.3). All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol. The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91.5 (+/-11.1; range 79 to 98), and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90. CONCLUSIONS: There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words. Furthermore, patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation, suggestive of retrograde amnesia.
OBJECTIVES: To correlate optical density and percent inhibition of a two-step heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antigen assay with thrombosis; the assay utilizes reaction inhibition characteristics of a high heparin concentration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with more than 50% decrease in platelet count or thrombocytopenia (<150 x 10(9)/L) after exposure to heparin, who had a positive two-step antigen assay [optical density (OD) >0.4 and >50 inhibition with high concentration of heparin] were included in the study. RESULTS: Forty of 94 HIT patients had thrombosis at diagnosis; 54/94 had isolated-HIT without thrombosis. Eight of the isolated-HIT patients developed thrombosis within the next 30 d; thus, a total of 48 patients had thrombosis at day 30. At diagnosis there was no significant difference in OD between HIT patients with thrombosis and those with isolated-HIT. However, OD was significantly higher in all patients with thrombosis (n = 48, 1.34 +/- 0.89), including isolated-HIT patients who later developed thrombosis within 30 d (n = 8, 1.84 +/- 0.64) as compared to isolated-HIT patients who did not develop thrombosis (0.96 +/- 0.75; P = 0.011 and P = 0.008). The Receiver Operative Characteristic Curve showed that OD >1.27 in the isolated-HIT group had a significantly higher chance of developing thrombosis by day 30. None of these groups showed significant difference in percent inhibition. Multivariate analysis showed a 2.8-fold increased risk of thrombosis in females. Similarly, thrombotic risk increased with age and OD values. CONCLUSION: Higher OD is associated with significant risk of subsequent thrombosis in patients with isolated-HIT; percent inhibition, however, was not predictive.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of and possible factors related to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in hospitalised patients with cancer. METHODS: Ninety adult patients were enrolled. Patients with risk factors for acute renal failure were excluded. Blood samples were examined the day before contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and serially for 3 days thereafter. CIN was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 mg/dl or more, or elevation of Cr to 25 % over baseline. Relationships between CIN and possible risk factors were investigated. RESULTS: CIN was detected in 18/90 (20 %) patients. CIN developed in 25.5 % patients who underwent chemotherapy and in 11 % patients who did not (P = 0.1). CIN more frequently developed in patients who had undergone CT within 45 days after the last chemotherapy (P = 0.005); it was also an independent risk factor (P = 0.017). CIN was significantly more after treatment with bevacizumab/irinotecan (P = 0.021) and in patients with hypertension (P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CIN after CT in hospitalised oncological patients was 20 %. CIN developed 4.5-times more frequently in patients with cancer who had undergone recent chemotherapy. Hypertension and the combination of bevacizumab/irinotecan may be additional risk factors for CIN development. KEY POINTS: . Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a concern for oncological patients undergoing CT. . CIN occurs more often when CT is performed <45 days after chemotherapy. . Hypertension and treatment with bevacizumab appear to be additional risk factors.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of major hemorrhage and stroke in people aged 76 and older with atrial fibrillation on adjusted-dose warfarin who had been recently been admitted to hospital. DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: A major healthcare network involving four tertiary hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-five patients aged 76 and older admitted to a major healthcare network between July 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002, with atrial fibrillation on warfarin were enrolled. MEASUREMENTS: Information regarding major bleeding episodes, strokes, and warfarin use was obtained from patients, relatives, primary physicians, and medical records. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-eight patients (42% men) with a mean age of 81.1 (range 76-94) were included in the analysis. Total follow-up on warfarin was 530 years (mean 28 months). There were 53 major hemorrhages, for an annual rate of 10.0%, including 24 (45.3%) life-threatening and five (9.4%) fatal bleeds. The annual stroke rate after initiation of warfarin was 2.6%. CONCLUSION: The rate of major hemorrhage was high in this old, frail group, but excluding fatalities, resulted in no long-term sequelae, and the stroke rate on warfarin was low, demonstrating how effective warfarin treatment is.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), including akathisia, with quetiapine in patients with bipolar mania. METHODS: Data were analyzed from four similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, 3- to 12-week studies. Two studies evaluated quetiapine monotherapy (up to 800 mg/day) (n = 209) versus placebo (n = 198), with lithium or haloperidol monotherapy as respective active controls. Two studies evaluated quetiapine (up to 800 mg/day) in combination with a mood stabilizer (lithium or divalproex, QTP + Li/DVP) (n = 196) compared to placebo and mood stabilizer (PBO + Li/DVP) (n = 203). Extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated using the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), adverse event reports and anticholinergic drug usage. RESULTS: The incidence of EPS-related adverse events, including akathisia, was no different with quetiapine monotherapy (12.9%) than with placebo (13.1%). Similarly, EPS-related adverse events with QTP + Li/DVP (21.4%) were no different than with PBO + Li/DVP (19.2%). Adverse events related to EPS occurred in 59.6% of patients treated with haloperidol (n = 99) monotherapy, whereas 26.5% of patients treated with lithium (n = 98) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to EPS. The incidence of akathisia was low and similar with quetiapine monotherapy (3.3%) and placebo (6.1%), and with QTP + Li/DVP (3.6%) and PBO + Li/DVP (4.9%). Lithium was associated with a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.05) of tremor (18.4%) than quetiapine (5.6%); cerebellar tremor, which is a known adverse effect of lithium, may have contributed to the elevated rate of tremor in patients receiving lithium therapy. Haloperidol induced a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.001) of akathisia (33.3% versus 5.9%), tremor (30.3% versus 7.8%), and extrapyramidal syndrome (35.4% versus 5.9%) than quetiapine. No significant differences were observed between quetiapine and placebo on SAS and BARS scores. Anticholinergic use was low and similar with quetiapine or placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In bipolar mania, the incidence of EPS, including akathisia, with quetiapine therapy is similar to that with placebo.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the morphologic changes in rat urothelium induced by indomethacin. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced cystitis is a poorly recognized and under-reported condition. In addition to tiaprofenic acid, indomethacin has been reported to be associated with this condition. METHODS: Three groups were established: a control group (n = 10), a high-dose group (n = 10), treated with one intraperitoneal injection of indomethacin 20 mg/kg, and a therapeutic dose group (n = 10) in which oral indomethacin was administered 3.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 3 weeks. The animals were then killed and the bladders removed for light and electron microscopic studies. RESULTS: The light microscopic findings showed some focal epithelial degeneration that was more prominent in the high-dose group. When compared with the control group, both indomethacin groups revealed statistically increased numbers of mast cells in the mucosa (P <0.0001) and penetration of lanthanum nitrate through intercellular areas of the epithelium. Furthermore, the difference in mast cell counts between the high and therapeutic dose groups was also statistically significant (P <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Indomethacin resulted in histopathologic findings typical of interstitial cystitis, such as leaky bladder epithelium and mucosal mastocytosis. The true incidence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced cystitis in humans must be clarified by prospective clinical trials.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the toxicity and activity of thalidomide in patients with advanced metastatic renal cell cancer and to measure changes of one angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165, with therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 patients were enrolled on a study of thalidomide using an intra-patient dose escalation schedule. Patients began thalidomide at 400 mg/d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg/d by day 54. Fifty-nine per cent of patients had had previous therapy with IL-2 and 52% were performance status 2 or 3. Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels were measured by dual monoclonal ELISA in 8 patients. RESULTS: 24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary metastases (4%), one minor response, and 2 patients stable for over 6 months. Somnolence and constipation were prominent toxicities and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg/day dose level. Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels did not change with therapy. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a low level of activity of thalidomide in renal cell carcinoma. Administration of doses over 800 mg/day was difficult to achieve in this patient population, however lower doses were practical. The dose-response relationship, if any, of thalidomide for renal cell carcinoma is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To study the long-term effects of androgen treatment on atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women. METHODS: In a population-based study in 513 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54-67 years, we studied the association between self-reported intramuscularly administered high-dose estrogen-testosterone therapy (estradiol- and testosterone esters) and aortic atherosclerosis. Aortic atherosclerosis was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta, which have been shown to reflect intima atherosclerosis. Hormone therapy users were compared with never users. RESULTS: Intramuscular hormone therapy use for 1 year or longer was reported by 25 women. In almost half of these women severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present (n=11), while in women without hormone use severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present in less than 20% (OR 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.5, adjusted for age, years since menopause, smoking, and body mass index). The association remained after additional adjustment for diabetes, cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, or alcohol use. No association was found for hormone use less than 1 year. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high-dose testosterone therapy may adversely affect atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women and indicate that androgen replacement in these women may not be harmless.
OBJECTIVES: To study the urinary symptoms and quality of life changes in Thai women with overactive bladder (OAB) after tolterodine treatment. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Thirty women (aged 30-77 years) diagnosed as having OAB at the Gynecology Clinic, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January to April 2004 were included in the present study. Tolterodine 2 mg, twice daily was given. After 8 weeks treatment, changes in micturition diary variables and tolerability were determined. Short form 36 (SF36) questionaires (Thai version) were given before and after 8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: At 8 weeks, all micturition per day decreased from 16. 7 +/- 5. 3 to 6. 7 +/- 2.4 times per day. The number of nocturia episodes decreased from 5.4 +/- 4.2 to 1.1 +/- 1.0 times per night. The most common side effect was dry month in 5 cases (16.7%) with 2 cases reporting a moderate degree and 1 case with severe degree. Only one case (3.3%) withdrew from the present study due to a severe dry mouth. The SF-36 scores changed significantly in the domains of physical functioning, role function emotional, social function and mental heath. CONCLUSION: Tolterodine was well tolerated and its effects improved the quality of life in Thai women with OAB.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions and compulsions, and shows considerable phenotypic variability. Family and twin studies have indicated a genetic component in the etiology of OCD, and the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) gene is an important candidate gene for OCD. This study investigates the influence of the functional COMT Val158Met polymorphism on the phenotypic expression of OCD, using an item-level factor-analytic approach in a large sample. The COMT Val158Met variant was genotyped in 373 patients and 462 controls. It was tested whether there was an association between the COMT Val158Met polymorphism and OCD or dimensional phenotypes such as YBOCS severity score, age of onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and six symptom dimensions recently found in a large item-level factor-analytic study [Katerberg et al., submitted]. We further investigated possible sex-specific associations between the COMT Val158Met polymorphism and OCD or dimensional phenotypes. There was a trend for an association of the COMT 158Met allele with OCD in males, and an interaction between the COMT Val158Met genotype and sex on the somatic and sensory phenomena symptom dimension, with females showing lower scores. In conclusion, a dimensional approach seems fruitful in detecting genes of importance for OCD.
Obsolete but dangerous antacid preparations.
Occasional case reports have shown that acute myopathy may occur in patients treated with massive doses of corticosteroids. The mechanism of this myopathy is poorly understood. Therefore, 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline (C), methylprednisolone (M), or triamcinolone (T) 80 mg/kg/d for 5 d. Nutritional intake, measured daily in 15 animals, showed a significant reduction of food intake in the steroid-treated groups (-50 and -79% in M and T, respectively). This was associated with a similar loss in body weight. In the 45 remaining animals, diaphragm contractility and histopathologic features of several muscles were studied. Weights of respiratory and peripheral muscles were similarly decreased after steroid treatment. Maximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group (653 +/- 174 g/cm(2)) than in the M group (837 +/- 171 g/cm(2); p < 0.05) and the T group (765 +/- 145 g/cm(2), NS). Half-relaxation time was prolonged in both steroid groups, and time to peak tension was longer with M, whereas tetanic tensions were similar. Steroid treatment also induced a leftward shift of the force-frequency curve at 25 and 50 Hz when compared with saline treatment (p < 0.05). ATPase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber atrophy in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa atrophy with T, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis. Finally, a pair-fed (PF) study, performed in 18 rats (C, T, and PF), showed that muscle atrophy was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in T-treated animals. We conclude that (1) short-term treatment with massive doses of steroids induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting; (2) both types of steroids induced predominantly type IIb atrophy, resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties; (3) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis; (4) type IIb atrophy was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone.
Octreotide, an effective treatment for acromegaly, induces gall bladder stones in 13-60% of patients. Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention, this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 octreotide treated acromegalic patients with gall stones. Chemical analysis of gall stones retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients, showed that they contained 71% and 87% cholesterol by weight. In the remaining 12 patients, localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of < 100 Hounsfield units (values of < 100 HU predict cholesterol rich, dissolvable stones). Gall bladder bile was obtained by ultrasound guided, fine needle puncture from six patients. All six patients had supersaturated bile (mean (SEM) cholesterol saturation index of 1.19 (0.08) (range 1.01-1.53)) and all had abnormally rapid cholesterol microcrystal nucleation times (< 4 days (range 1-4)), whilst in four, the bile contained cholesterol microcrystals immediately after sampling. Of the 12 patients considered for oral ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment, two had a blocked cystic duct and were not started on UDCA while one was lost to follow up. After one year of treatment, five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial (n = 3) or complete (n = 2) gall stone dissolution, suggesting that their stones were cholesterol rich. This corresponds, by actuarial (life table) analysis, to a combined gall stone dissolution rate of 58.3 (15.9%). In conclusion, octreotide induced gall stones are generally small, multiple, and cholesterol rich although, in common with spontaneous gall stone disease, at presentation some patients will have a blocked cystic duct and some gall stones containing calcium.

Of 158 asthmatic patients who were placed on inhaled beclomethasone, 15 (9.5%) developed either hoarseness (8), oral thrush (6), or both (1). When their adverse reactions subsided, seven of these 15 patients were rechallenged with inhaled beclomethasone. These included five cases who developed hoarseness and three who developed Candidiasis. One patient had both. Oral thrush did not recur, but 60% (3/5) of patients with hoarseness had recurrence. We conclude that patients may be restarted on inhaled beclomethasone when clinically indicated; however, because of the high recurrence rate, patients who develop hoarseness should not be re-challenged. Concomitant use of oral prednisone and topical beclomethasone may increase the risk of developing hoarseness or candidiasis.
Of 26 patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (CAH) starting in childhood 18 (69%) had low C4 and 5 (19%) had low C3 serum levels. Impaired hepatic synthesis and immune-consumption were unlikely since transferrin levels were normal in all patients, albumin levels were persistently low in only 3, and only 3 had raised levels of activation fragment C3d. C4d was normal in all patients studied. In the families of 12 probands with low C4, 7 parents had low C4 and 2 had levels which were at the lower limit of normal. 5 of 10 siblings from 5 families had low C4. These results suggest that low C4 levels in CAH are genetically determined. C4 phenotyping in 20 patients and in 26 parents showed that 90% and 81%, respectively, had null allotypes at either the C4A or C4B locus compared with 59% in controls, indicating that defective expression of structural genes may contribute to the observed C4 deficiency..
Of the many palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) conditions, only Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) and Haim-Munk syndrome (HMS) are associated with premature periodontal destruction. Although both PLS and HMS share the cardinal features of PPK and severe periodontitis, a number of additional findings are reported in HMS including arachnodactyly, acro-osteolysis, atrophic changes of the nails, and a radiographic deformity of the fingers. While PLS cases have been identified throughout the world, HMS has only been described among descendants of a religious isolate originally from Cochin, India. Parental consanguinity is a characteristic of many cases of both conditions. Although autosomal recessive transmission of PLS is evident, a more " complex " autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance with phenotypic influences from a closely linked modifying locus has been hypothesised for HMS. Recently, mutations of the cathepsin C gene have been identified as the underlying genetic defect in PLS. To determine if a cathepsin C mutation is also responsible for HMS, we sequenced the gene in affected and unaffected subjects from the Cochin isolate in which both the PLS and HMS phenotypes appear. Here we report identification of a mutation of cathepsin C (exon 6, 2127A-- > G) that changes a highly conserved amino acid in the cathepsin C peptide. This mutation segregates with HMS in four nuclear families. Additionally, the existence of a shared common haplotype for genetic loci flanking the cathepsin C gene suggests that affected subjects descended from the Cochin isolate are homozygous for a mutation inherited " identical by descent " from a common ancestor. This finding supports simple autosomal recessive inheritance for HMS in these families. We also report a mutation of the same exon 6 CTSC codon (2126C-- > T) in a Turkish family with classical PLS. These findings provide evidence that PLS and HMS are allelic variants of cathepsin C gene mutations..

Often, chemotherapy by doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is limited due to life threatening cardiotoxicity in patients during and posttherapy. Recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation, ATP synthesis, and upregulated JAK/STAT3 pathway. In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high fat diet (HFD), which induces obesity in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. A LD(10) dose (8 mg doxorubicin/kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher cardiotoxicity, cardiac dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the obese (OB) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity. Doxorubicin toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol (toxic metabolite) in the normal diet-fed (ND) and OB hearts. Mechanistic studies revealed that OB rats are sensitized due to: (1) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, (2) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, (3) decreased plasma adiponectin levels, (4) decreased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation (666.9+/-14.0 nmol/min/g heart in ND versus 400.2+/-11.8 nmol/min/g heart in OB), (5) decreased mitochondrial AMP-alpha2 protein kinase, and (6) 86% drop in cardiac ATP levels accompanied by decreased ATP/ADP ratio after doxorubicin administration. Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK/STAT3 pathway. In conclusion, HFD-induced obese rats are highly sensitized to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial ATP generation, increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK/STAT3 pathway.
Olfactory receptors (OR) are encoded by a large multigene family including hundreds of members dispersed throughout the human genome. Cloning and mapping studies have determined that a large proportion of the olfactory receptor genes are located on human chromosomes 6, 11, and 17, as well as distributed on other chromosomes. In this paper, we describe and characterize the organization of olfactory receptor genes on human chromosome 11 by using degenerate PCR-based probes to screen chromosome 11-specific and whole genome clone libraries for members of the OR gene family. OR genes were identified by DNA sequencing and then localized to regions of chromosome 11. Physical maps of several gene clusters were constructed to determine the chromosomal relationships between various members of the family. This work identified 25 new OR genes located on chromosome 11 in at least seven distinct regions. Three of these regions contain gene clusters that include additional members of this gene family not yet identified by sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the newly described OR genes suggests a mechanism for the generation of genetic diversity.
Omeprazole is the first drug designed to block the final step in the acid secretory process within the parietal cell. It has been shown to be extremely effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, reflux esophagitis, and the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Although clinical experience with omeprazole is still limited, many controlled studies have established the short-term safety of this drug. We report the first case of a serious short-term adverse reaction with the use of omeprazole: hemolytic anemia. The patient developed weakness, lethargy, and shortness of breath 2 days after starting therapy with omeprazole. Two weeks after the initiation of therapy, her hematocrit had decreased from 44.1% to 20.4%, and she had a positive direct Coombs antiglobulin test and an elevated indirect bilirubin. After she discontinued the omeprazole, her hemoglobin and hematocrit gradually returned to normal. The mechanism by which omeprazole caused the patient's hemolytic anemia is uncertain, but physicians should be alerted to this possible adverse effect.

One approach to understanding the function of presenilin 1 (PS1), is to discover those proteins with which it interacts. Evidence for a function in developmental patterning came from C. elegans, in which a PS homologue was identified by screening for suppressors of a mutation in Notch/lin-12, a gene which specifies cell fate. However, this genetic experiment cannot determine which proteins directly interact with PS1. Therefore, we utilized the two hybrid system and confirmatory co-immunoprecipitations to identify a novel catenin, termed delta-catenin, which interacts with PS1 and is principally expressed in brain. The catenins are a gene family related to the Armadillo gene in Drosophila, some of which appear to have dual roles-they are components of cell-cell adherens junctions, and may serve as intermediates in the Wingless (Wg) signaling pathway, which, like Notch/lin-12, is also responsible for a variety of inductive signaling events. In the non-neuronal 293 cell line, PS1 interacted with beta-catenin, the family member with the greatest homology to Armadillo. Wg and Notch interactions are mediated by the Dishevelled gene, which may form a signaling complex with PS1 and Wg pathway intermediates to regulate the function of the Notch/lin-12 gene.
One case of acute hypercalcaemia and two of recurrent nephrolithiasis are reported in patients who had regularly consumed large amounts of calcium carbon-ate-sodium bicarbonate powders for more than 20 years. The powders had been obtained from pharmacists unknown to the patients' medical practitioners. It is suggested that these preparations were responsible for the patient's problems, and that such powders should no longer be freely obtainable.
One hundred and fifty-one patients intolerant to zidovudine (AZT) received didanosine (ddI) to a maximum dose of 12.5 mg/kg/day. Patient response was assessed using changes in CD4+ lymphocyte subset count, HIV p24 antigen, weight, and quality of life. Seventy patients developed major opportunistic infections whilst on therapy; this was the first AIDS diagnosis in 17. Only minor changes in CD4+ lymphocyte subset count were observed in AIDS patients, although a more significant rise occurred in those with earlier stages of disease. Of those positive for p24 antigen at the commencement of the study 67% showed a positive response, and this was most likely in those with CD4+ lymphocyte subset counts above 100 mm3. A positive weight response was seen in 16% of patients. Most patients showed improvement in individual parameters and global score of quality of life. Adverse reactions possibly attributable to didanosine were common. The most common side-effect was diarrhoea, which resulted in cessation of therapy in 19 individuals. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 12 patients and pancreatitis in six. Thirteen patients developed a raised serum amylase without abdominal pain. Seven patients developed glucose tolerance curves characteristic of diabetes but these were mild, did not require treatment and returned to normal on ceasing didanosine.
One hundred and twenty-eight of 145 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were found to be HLA B27 positive. Five patients had evidence of a sero-negative peripheral arthritis resembling peripheral psoriatic arthritis and 3 of these were B27 negative. One further B27 negative patients had a sister with ankylosing spondylitis and ulcerative colitis and a mother with ulcerative colitis. There was evidence of a somewhat later age of onset of symptoms in B27 negative patients. These findings are interpreted as suggesting some degree of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in ankylosing spondylitis with genes for psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease being important in some individuals, particularly those who are B27 negative. Twenty-five first-degree relatives with ankylosing spondylitis were all B27 positive. The only instance of disassociation of B27 and spondylitis in a family was where the proband had ulcerative colitis as well as spondylitis. Of 13 B27 positive fathers 3 could be diagnosed as having definite ankylosing spondylitis (23%). These findings are thought to provide evidence against the concept that the gene for ankylosing spondylitis is not B27 but a closely linked gene and favour the occurrence of an environmental event affecting approximately one-fifth of B27 positive males to result in disease..
One of female MZ twins presented with muscular dystrophy. Physical examination, creatine phosphokinase levels, and muscle biopsy were consistent with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, because of her sex she was diagnosed as having limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. With cDNA probes to the DMD gene, a gene deletion was detected in the twins and their mother. The de novo mutation which arose in the mother was shown by novel junction fragments generated by HindIII, PstI, or TaqI when probed with cDNA8. Additional evidence of a large gene deletion was given by novel SfiI junction fragments detected by probes p20, J-Bir, and J-66 on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Immunoblot analysis of muscle from the affected twin showed dystrophin of normal size but of reduced amount. Immunofluorescent visualization of dystrophin revealed foci of dystrophin-positive fibers adjacent to foci of dystrophin-negative fibers. These data indicate that the affected twin is a manifesting carrier of an abnormal DMD gene, her myopathy being a direct result of underexpression of dystrophin. Cytogenetic analysis revealed normal karyotypes, eliminating the possibility of a translocation affecting DMD gene function. Both linkage analysis and DNA fingerprint analysis revealed that each twin has two different X chromosomes, eliminating the possibility of uniparental disomy as a mechanism for DMD expression. On the basis of methylation differences of the paternal and maternal X chromosomes in these MZ twins, we propose uneven lyonization (X chromosome inactivation) as the underlying mechanism for disease expression in the affected female..
One of the fundamental questions concerning expression and function of dimeric enzymes involves the impact of naturally occurring mutations on subunit assembly and heterodimer activity. This question is of particular interest for the human enzyme galactose-l-phosphate uridylyl-transferase (GALT), impairment of which results in the inherited metabolic disorder galactosemia, because many if not most patients studied to date are compound heterozygotes rather than true molecular homozygotes. Furthermore, the broad range of phenotypic severity observed in these patients raises the possibility that allelic combination, not just allelic constitution, may play some role in determining outcome. In the work described herein, we have selected two distinct naturally occurring null mutations of GALT, Q188R and R333W, and asked the questions (i) what are the impacts of these mutations on subunit assembly, and (ii) if heterodimers do form, are they active ? To answer these questions, we have established a yeast system for the coexpression of epitope-tagged alleles of human GALT and investigated both the extent of specific GALT subunit interactions and the activity of defined heterodimer pools. We have found that both homodimers and heterodimers do form involving each of the mutant subunits tested and that both heterodimer pools retain substantial enzymatic activity. These results are significant not only in terms of their implications for furthering our understanding of galactosemia and GALT holoenzyme structure-function relationships but also because the system described may serve as a model for similar studies of other complexes composed of multiple subunits..
Open-label assessment of levofloxacin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in adults.
Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is characterized by nociceptive sensitization caused by the cessation of chronic opioid use. OIH can limit the clinical use of opioid analgesics and complicate withdrawal from opioid addiction. In this study, we investigated the effects of Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides, the bioactive components of ginseng, on OIH. OIH was achieved in mice after subcutaneous administration of morphine for 7 consecutive days three times per day. During withdrawal (days 8 and 9), these mice were administered Re, Rg1, or Rb1 intragastrically two times per day. On the test day (day 10), mice were subjected to the thermal sensitivity test and the acetic acid-induced writhing test. Re (300 mg/kg) inhibited OIH in both the thermal sensitivity test and the acetic acid-induced writhing test. However, the Rg1 and Rb1 ginsenosides failed to prevent OIH in either test. Furthermore, Rg1 showed a tendency to aggravate OIH in the acetic acid-induced writhing test. Our data suggested that the ginsenoside Re, but not Rg1 or Rb1, may contribute toward reversal of OIH.

Oral administration of lindane (2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, body weight) for 5 days was found to produce a dose-dependent increase in the activity of P450 dependent 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (PROD) and N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase (NDMA-d) in rat brain and liver. A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose (2.5 mg/kg) of lindane was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days. As observed with different doses, the magnitude of induction in the activity of P450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain. Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P450 1A1/1A2, 2B1/2B2 and 2E1 isoenzymes. In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD, EROD and NDMA-d are due to the increase in the levels of P450 2B1/2B2, 1A1/1A2 and 2E1 isoenzymes, respectively. Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), an inducer of P4501A1/1A2, did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of lindane induced convulsions, pretreatment with phenobarbital (PB), an inducer of P450 2B1/2B2 or ethanol, an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed reactions, significantly increased the incidence of lindane induced convulsions. Similarly, when the P450-mediated metabolism of lindane was blocked by cobalt chloride incidence of convulsions was increased in animals treated with lindane indicating that lindane per se or its metabolites formed by PB or ethanol inducible P450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral toxicity.

Oral hydrocortisone increases blood pressure and enhances pressor responsiveness in normal human subjects. We studied the effects of 1 week of oral hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) on blood pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, forearm vascular resistance, and norepinephrine spillover to plasma in eight healthy male volunteers. Although diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged, systolic blood pressure increased from 119 to 135 mm Hg (SED +/- 3.4, p less than 0.01), associated with an increased cardiac output (5.85-7.73 l/min, SED +/- 0.46, p less than 0.01). Total peripheral vascular resistance fell from 15.1 to 12.2 mm Hg/l/min (SED +/- 1.03, p less than 0.05). Resting forearm vascular resistance remained unchanged, but the reflex response to the cold pressor test was accentuated, the rise in resistance increasing from 10.5 mm Hg/ml/100 ml/min (R units) before treatment to 32.6 R units after treatment (SED +/- 6.4, p less than 0.025). The rise in forearm vascular resistance accompanying intra-arterial norepinephrine (25, 50, and 100 ng/min) was also significantly greater after hydrocortisone, increasing from an average of 14.9 +/- 2.4 R units before treatment to 35.1 +/- 5.5 R units after hydrocortisone (SED +/- 6.0, p less than 0.05). A shift to the left in the dose-response relation and fall in threshold suggested increased sensitivity to norepinephrine after treatment. Measurement of resting norepinephrine spillover rate to plasma and norepinephrine uptake indicated that overall resting sympathetic nervous system activity was not increased. The rise in resting blood pressure with hydrocortisone is associated with an increased cardiac output (presumably due to increased blood volume).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Oral manifestations of "meth mouth": a case report.
Organic mental disorder was observed in a 29-year-old female in the prognostic period after the onset of carmofur-induced leukoencephalopathy. Symptoms such as euphoria, emotional lability and puerile attitude noted in the patient were diagnosed as organic personality syndrome according to the criteria defined in the DSM-III-R. It is referred to as a frontal lobe syndrome. Brain CT revealed a periventricular low density area in the frontal white matter and moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles especially at the bilateral anterior horns. Consequently, carmofur-induced leukoencephalopathy may uncommonly result in organic personality syndrome in the residual state. It may be attributed to the structural damage to the frontal lobe.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable bone disorder characterized by fractures with minimal trauma. Intracranial hemorrhage has been reported in a small number of OI patients. Here we describe three patients, a boy (aged 15 years) and two girls (aged 17 and 7 years) with OI type III who suffered intracranial hemorrhage and in addition had brachydactyly and nail hypoplasia. In all of these patients, OI was caused by glycine mutations affecting exon 49 of the COL1A2 gene, which codes for the most carboxy-terminal part of the triple-helical domain of the collagen type I alpha 2 chain. These observations suggest that mutations in this region of the collagen type I alpha 2 chain carry a high risk of abnormal limb development and intracranial bleeding.

Our aim was to observe if patients with panic disorder (PD) and patients with major depression with panic attacks (MDP) (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria) respond in a similar way to the induction of panic attacks by an oral caffeine challenge test. We randomly selected 29 patients with PD, 27 with MDP, 25 with major depression without panic attacks (MD), and 28 healthy volunteers. The patients had no psychotropic drug for at least a 4-week period. In a randomized double-blind experiment performed in 2 occasions 7 days apart, 480 mg caffeine and a caffeine-free (placebo) solution were administered in a coffee form and anxiety scales were applied before and after each test. A total of 58.6% (n = 17) of patients with PD, 44.4% (n = 12) of patients with MDP, 12.0% (n = 3) of patients with MD, and 7.1% (n= 2) of control subjects had a panic attack after the 480-mg caffeine challenge test (chi(2)(3) = 16.22, P = .001). The patients with PD and MDP were more sensitive to caffeine than were patients with MD and healthy volunteers. No panic attack was observed after the caffeine-free solution intake. The patients with MD had a lower heart rate response to the test than all the other groups (2-way analysis of variance, group by time interaction with Greenhouse-Geisser correction: F(3,762) = 2.85, P = .026). Our data suggest that there is an association between panic attacks, no matter if associated with PD or MDP, and hyperreactivity to an oral caffeine challenge test.
Our objective was to investigate brain MR imaging findings and the utility of diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during tacrolimus therapy. Brain MR studies, including DW imaging, were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving tacrolimus who developed neurologic complications. In each patient who had abnormalities on the initial MR study, a follow-up MR study was performed 1 month later. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on the initial MR study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions. Of the 14 patients, 5 (35.7%) had white matter abnormalities, 1 (7.1%) had putaminal hemorrhage, and 8 (57.1%) had normal findings on initial MR images. Among the 5 patients with white matter abnormalities, 4 patients (80.0%) showed higher than normal ADC values on initial MR images, and all showed complete resolution on follow-up images. The remaining 1 patient (20.0%) showed lower than normal ADC value and showed incomplete resolution with cortical laminar necrosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging may be useful in predicting the outcomes of the lesions of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity.
Our previous studies have shown that activation of a related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) (also known as Pyk2) is required for dexamethasone (Dex)-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM) cells and that human interleukin-6 (IL-6), a known growth and survival factor for MM cells, blocks both RAFTK activation and apoptosis induced by Dex. However, the mechanism whereby IL-6 inhibits Dex-induced apoptosis is undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 mediates this protective effect. We show that IL-6 triggers selective activation of SHP2 and its association with RAFTK in Dex-treated MM cells. SHP2 interacts with RAFTK through a region other than its Src homology 2 domains. We demonstrate that RAFTK is a direct substrate of SHP2 both in vitro and in vivo, and that Tyr(906) in the C-terminal domain of RAFTK mediates its interaction with SHP2. Moreover, overexpression of dominant negative SHP2 blocked the protective effect of IL-6 against Dex-induced apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that SHP2 mediates the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 and suggest SHP2 as a novel therapeutic target in MM.
Our previous studies on the promoter function of the human C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) gene revealed the existence of two GC-rich cis elements essential for gene transcription in rat pituitary-derived GH3 cells. To isolate transcription factors that bind to those GC-rich elements, we screened a lambda ZAP cDNA library derived from GH3 cells by Southwestern screening. Several positive clones with specific binding abilities were obtained, and one was identical as TSC-22, a speculated transcriptional modulator stimulated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) of unknown function. TSC-22 significantly enhanced CNP promoter activity in GH3 cells. We further cloned a 1.8-kb full-length human TSC-22 cDNA from a fetal kidney cDNA library by a combination of polymerase chain reaction and the rapid amplification of the cDNA ends technique. In adults, human TSC-22 mRNA was highly expressed in brain, lung and heart. TSC-22 gene expression in GH3 and human aortic endothelial cells was stimulated by cytokines including TGF-beta, in correlation with the CNP mRNA increase. These results suggest that TSC-22 is a transcriptional regulator of the CNP gene and transmits signals from cytokines, such as TGF-beta, to CNP gene expression.
Ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 carriers is modified by the HRAS1 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) locus.
Over 100 distinct disease-associated mutations have been identified in the breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1. Loss of the wild-type allele in > 90% of tumors from patients with inherited BRCA1 mutations indicates tumor suppressive function. The low incidence of somatic mutations suggests that BRCA1 inactivation in sporadic tumors occurs by alternative mechanisms, such as interstitial chromosomal deletion or reduced transcription. To identify possible features of the BRCA1 genomic region that may contribute to chromosomal instability as well as potential transcriptional regulatory elements, a 117, 143-bp DNA sequence encompassing BRCA1 was obtained by random sequencing of four cosmids identified from a human chromosome 17 specific library. The 24 exons of BRCA1 span an 81-kb region that has an unusually high density of Alu repetitive DNA (41. 5%), but relatively low density (4. 8%) of other repetitive sequences. BRCA1 intron lengths range in size from 403 bp to 9. 2 kb and contain the intragenic microsatellite markers D17S1323, D17S1322, and D17S855, which localize to introns 12, 19, and 20, respectively. In addition to BRCA1, the contig contains two complete genes Rho7, a member of the rho family of GTP binding proteins, and VAT1, an abundant membrane protein of cholinergic synaptic vesicles. Partial sequences of the 1A1-3B B-box protein pseudogene and IFP 35, an interferon induced leucine zipper protein, reside within the contig. An L21 ribosomal protein pseudogene is embedded in BRCA1 intron 13. The order of genes on the chromosome is centromere-1FP 35-VAT1-Rho7-BRCA1-1A1-3B-telomere

Oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage in adriamycin-induced cardiac mitochondrial injury.
Oxidative stress is involved in several processes including cancer, aging and cardiovascular disease, and has been shown to potentiate the therapeutic effect of drugs such as doxorubicin. Doxorubicin causes significant cardiotoxicity characterized by marked increases in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Herein, we investigate whether doxorubicin-associated chronic cardiac toxicity can be ameliorated with the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol in rats with breast cancer. Thirty-six rats bearing breast tumors induced chemically were divided into 4 groups: control, hydroxytyrosol (0.5mg/kg, 5days/week), doxorubicin (1mg/kg/week), and doxorubicin plus hydroxytyrosol. Cardiac disturbances at the cellular and mitochondrial level, mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I-IV and apoptosis-inducing factor, and oxidative stress markers have been analyzed. Hydroxytyrosol improved the cardiac disturbances enhanced by doxorubicin by significantly reducing the percentage of altered mitochondria and oxidative damage. These results suggest that hydroxytyrosol improve the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This study demonstrates that hydroxytyrosol protect rat heart damage provoked by doxorubicin decreasing oxidative damage and mitochondrial alterations.

Oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) is a cytosolic protein that undergoes ligand-induced binding to the Golgi apparatus and has been implicated in the regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae an OSBP homologue is involved in membrane trafficking through the Golgi complex. Prompted by the multitude of OSBP-related genes in the yeast genome, we carried out a search for human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) displaying homology to the sterol-binding domain of OSBP. This revealed a minimum of six novel OSBP-related proteins, designated ORP-1 to ORP-6. ORP cDNA probes were generated by reverse transcription-PCR from human liver mRNA, and used for Northern blot analysis of human tissue transcript panels. This verified that each of them represents a different gene product and showed that they display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns. The ORP-1 and -2 mRNA expression levels were similar to or higher than that of OSBP while the ORP-3 to -6 mRNAs were detected at lower levels in specific tissues. The most abundantly expressed new gene, ORP-1, was transcribed at strikingly high levels in the cortical areas of human brain and displayed sterol-regulated expression in a cultured human neuroblastoma cell line. This indicates that ORP-1 may play an important role in maintaining the sterol balance in cells of the central nervous system. Together with OSBP, the identified gene products constitute a novel human protein family that may provide a link between organellar sterol status and membrane dynamics.
Oxytocin is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension, particularly when given as a bolus. The resulting hypotension can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return. Parturients with normal volume status, heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and stroke volume. Oxytocin-induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood loss. Pulse power analysis (also called "pulse contour analysis") of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real time, thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pressure. Pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anesthesia. Hypotension in response to oxytocin was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in stroke volume, heart rate and cardiac output. Pulse power analysis may be helpful in determining the etiology of and treating hypotension during cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia.

PAX6 gene dosage effect in a family with congenital cataracts, aniridia, anophthalmia and central nervous system defects.
PAX6 is a transcription factor with two DNA-binding domains (paired box and homeobox) and a proline-serine-threonine (PST) -rich transactivation domain. PAX6 regulates eye development in animals ranging from jellyfish to Drosophila to humans. Heterozygous mutations in the human PAX6 gene result in various phenotypes, including aniridia, Peters anomaly, autosomal dominant keratitis, and familial foveal dysplasia. It is believed that the mutated allele of PAX6 produces an inactive protein and aniridia is caused due to genetic haploinsufficiency. However, several truncation mutations have been found to occur in the C-terminal half of PAX6 in patients with Aniridia resulting in mutant proteins that retain the DNA-binding domains but have lost most of the transactivation domain. It is not clear whether such mutants really behave as loss-of-function mutants as predicted by haploinsufficiency. Contrary to this theory, our data showed that these mutants are dominant-negative in transient transfection assays when they are coexpressed with wild-type PAX6. We found that the dominant-negative effects result from the enhanced DNA binding ability of these mutants. Kinetic studies of binding and dissociation revealed that various truncation mutants have 3-5-fold higher affinity to various DNA-binding sites when compared with the wild-type PAX6. These results provide a new insight into the role of mutant PAX6 in causing aniridia..

PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) is a secreted protein produced by breast cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. Because of its structural similarity to PTH at the amino terminus, the two proteins interact with a common cell surface receptor, the PTH/PTHrP receptor. When overproduced by tumor cells, PTHrP enters the circulation, giving rise to the common paraneoplastic syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Although initially discovered in malignancies, PTHrP is now known to be produced by most cells and tissues in the body. It acts as an autocrine and paracrine mediator of cell proliferation and differentiation, effects which are mediated via the PTH/PTHrP receptor. Recent evidence also has shown that, directly after translation, PTHrP is able to enter the nucleus and/or nucleolus and influence cell cycle progression and apoptosis. In this study, we have either overproduced PTHrP or inhibited endogenous PTHrP production in the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Overexpression of PTHrP was associated with an increase in mitogenesis, whereas inhibiting endogenous PTHrP production resulted in decreased cell proliferation. The overexpressed peptide targeted to the perinuclear space. In contrast, PTHrP interaction with the cell surface PTH/PTHrP receptor resulted in decreased cell proliferation in the same cell line. This latter effect is dependent on interaction with the receptor, in that exogenously added PTHrP moieties known not to interact with the receptor had no effect on cell growth. Furthermore, neutralization of added peptide with an anti-PTHrP antiserum completely abolished the growth inhibitory effects. In contrast, this antibody has no effect on the increased proliferation rate of the MCF-7 transfectants that overexpress PTHrP, compared with control cells. The net effect of autocrine/paracrine and intracrine effects of PTHrP in MCF-7 cells overproducing the peptide is accelerated cell growth. These findings have critical implications regarding the role of PTHrP in breast cancer, and they suggest that controlling PTHrP production in breast cancer may be useful therapeutically.
PTU-associated vasculitis in a girl with Turner Syndrome and Graves' disease.
PURPOSE. The authors earlier findings of a negative electroretinogram (ERG) in a boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) led them to investigate dystrophin gene deletions and ERGs in five boys with DMD. The authors wanted to determined whether there were similar ERG findings in an animal model for DMD, the mdx mouse. METHODS. Ganzfeld ERGs were recorded in five boys with DMD after a complete ophthalmic examination. The dystrophin gene was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. ERGs were recorded in anesthetized mdx and control mice with a modified Grass photostimulator (Grass Instrument Company, Quincy, MA). RESULTS. Ophthalmic examinations in all five boys had normal findings, yet an abnormal negative ERG was recorded for each subject. The subjects gene deletions were variable, ranging from large deletions to no detectable deletions. The ERGs of the mdx mice were normal and did not differ significantly from those of the control mice. CONCLUSIONS. The authors believe the unique ERG recorded for the human subjects is a manifestation of DMD associated with defects at the dystrophin gene locus and represents a new clinical entity. The ERG of the mdx mouse may be spared for several reasons, including milder effects of the mouse gene defect, differences in muscle and retinal gene product, or species differences in the biochemical role of dystrophin. The ERG shows promise of becoming a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DMD and its milder allelic forms..
PURPOSE: Apnea is known to occur during seizures, but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few. Data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce. Here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. METHODS: Twelve rats (six chronically epileptic animals and six controls) were anesthetized, given tracheotomies, and subjected to hyperventilation or hypoventilation conditions. Breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph. This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer, passed through a polygraph, and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), breathing frequency (f), and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) on a breath-by-breath basis. RESULTS: The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine-treated and control rats. Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups, in the epileptic group, the decrease in VE was due to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals. The hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2, followed by an increase in VE. In the epileptic group, the increase in VE was mediated by a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group. Systemic application of KCN, to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation, led to a similar increase in VE for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that pilocarpine-treated animals have an altered ability to react to (or compensate for) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined. We speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different epilepsy-associated conditions.
PURPOSE: DNA-damaging factors have been reported in patients that failed to achieve pregnancy after assisted reproductive technologies (ART). The hypothesis was that increased circulating cell-free DNA released by damaged cells could predict unfavorable conditions leading to failed ART treatment. The objective was to compare the relative concentrations of cell-free DNA in the luteal phase sera of nonpregnant versus pregnant patients. METHODS: Frozen-thawed sera (30 IVF cases) were obtained 1 week after embryo transfer. There were 16 pregnant and 14 nonpregnant cases and controls consisting of male sera (n = 8 cases). Modified isocratic capillary electrophoresis was performed and the images analyzed for cell-free DNA. RESULTS: Circulating cell-free DNA were identified in the sera of all patients. The serum concentrations of high (12 kb) and low (1 kb) molecular weight cell-free DNA were similar for both nonpregnant and pregnant patients. Male control sera had higher cell-free DNA concentrations compared with females. Evaluation of sera from a control case showed no fluctuations in cell-free DNA concentrations throughout specific days of the menstrual cycle. CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support the use of the luteal phase cell-free DNA concentration as a marker for failed pregnancies. The equal concentrations of high and low molecular weight cell-free DNA and ladder band-like gel patterns suggested cell apoptosis as the source of DNA.
PURPOSE: Despite its well-known cardiotoxicity, the anthracyclin doxorubicin (DOX) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent. DOX-induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX. Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system. The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) showed cardioprotection against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties. Because of the relatively short final half-life of monoHER (about 30 min), it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect. METHODS: Six groups of 6 BALB/c mice were treated with saline, DOX alone or DOX (4 mg/kg i.v.) preceded by monoHER (500 mg/kg i.p.) with an interval of 10, 30, 60 or 120 min. After a 6-week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks, the mice were sacrificed. Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy, after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham (in Cancer Treat Rep 62(6):865-872, 1978). Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group (P<0.001). RESULTS: The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9.6-fold (95% CI 4.4-21.0) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group. The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 (mean 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, P=0.019). The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4.4-fold reduction (P<0.001, 95% CI 2.3-8.2) of abnormal cardiomyocytes. This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration (P=0.345). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX.
PURPOSE: GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) in various experimental models of epilepsy. To investigate how GAP43 expression (GAP43-ir) correlates with MFS, we assessed the intensity (densitometry) and extension (width) of GAP43-ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (IML) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine (Pilo), previously injected or not with cycloheximide (CHX), which has been shown to inhibit MFS. METHODS: CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats. The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs, except for CHX. Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later, and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43-ir in the IML between Pilo, CHX+Pilo, and control groups. However, the results of the width of the GAP43-ir band in the IML showed that CHX+Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band (p = 0.03) as compared with that in the Pilo group. CONCLUSIONS: Our current finding that animals in the CHX+Pilo group have a GAP43-ir band in the IML, similar to that of controls, reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals. The change in GAP43-ir present in Pilo-treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP-43.
PURPOSE: Glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of ocular hypertension and corticosteroid glaucoma in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facility. The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes. METHODS: The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow, variable pressure perfusion culture system. Paired eyes were perfused in serum-free media with or without 10(-7) M dexamethasone for 12 days. Intraocular pressure was monitored daily. After incubation, the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and scanning laser confocal microscopy. RESULTS: A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with dexamethasone with an average pressure rise of 17.5 +/- 3.8 mm Hg after 12 days of dexamethasone exposure. The contralateral control eyes, which did not receive dexamethasone, maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period. The outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal. In contrast, the dexamethasone-treated hypertensive eyes had thickened trabecular beams, decreased intertrabecular spaces, thickened juxtacanalicular tissue, activated trabecular meshwork cells, and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material, especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm. The dexamethasone-treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes, although several subtle dexamethasone-induced morphologic changes were evident. CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone treatment of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes led to the generation of ocular hypertension in approximately 30% of the dexamethasone-treated eyes. Steroid treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for corticosteroid glaucoma and open angle glaucoma. This system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in steroid glaucoma and primary open angle glaucoma.
PURPOSE: NGF and PGs in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine. We investigated changes in urinary NGF and PGs in women with OAB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study groups included 65 women with OAB and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls. Evaluation included patient history, urinalysis, a voiding diary and urodynamic studies. Urine samples were collected. NGF, PGE2, PGF2alpha and PGI2 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups. In addition, correlations between urinary NGF and PG, and urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB were examined. RESULTS: Urinary NGF, PGE2 and PGF2alpha were significantly increased in patients with OAB compared with controls (p <0.05). However, urinary PGI2 was not different between controls and patients with OAB. In patients with OAB urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05). Urinary NGF, PGF2alpha and PGI2 did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB. CONCLUSIONS: NGF and PGs have important roles in the development of OAB symptoms in female patients. Urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate OAB symptoms.
PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium is a recognized complication in populations at risk. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of early postoperative delirium in a population without known risk factors admitted to the ICU for postoperative monitoring after elective major surgery. The secondary outcome investigated is to identify eventual independent risk factors among demographic data and anesthetic drugs used. METHODS: An observational, prospective study was conducted on a consecutive cohort of patients admitted to our ICU within and for at least 24 h after major surgical procedures. Exclusion criteria were any preexisting predisposing factor for delirium or other potentially confounding neurological dysfunctions. Patients were assessed daily using the confusion assessment method for the ICU scale for 3 days after the surgical procedure. Early postoperative delirium incidence risk factors were then assessed through three different multiple regression models. RESULTS: According to the confusion assessment method for the ICU scale, 28 % of patients were diagnosed with early postoperative delirium. The use of thiopentone was significantly associated with an eight-fold-higher risk for delirium compared to propofol (57.1% vs. 7.1%, RR = 8.0, X2 = 4.256; df = 1; 0.05 < p < 0.02). CONCLUSION: In this study early postoperative delirium was found to be a very common complication after major surgery, even in a population without known risk factors. Thiopentone was independently associated with an increase in its relative risk.
PURPOSE: Prenatal cocaine exposure has been linked with subependymal hemorrhage and the formation of cysts that are detectable on cranial sonography in neonates born at term. We sought to determine if prenatal cocaine exposure increases the incidence of subependymal cysts in preterm infants. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and cranial sonograms obtained during a 1-year period on 122 premature (< 36 weeks of gestation) infants. Infants were categorized into 1 of 2 groups: those exposed to cocaine and those not exposed to cocaine. Infants were assigned to the cocaine-exposed group if there was a maternal history of cocaine abuse during pregnancy or if maternal or neonatal urine toxicology results were positive at the time of delivery. RESULTS: Five of the 122 infants were excluded from the study because of insufficient medical and drug histories. The incidence of subependymal cysts in the 117 remaining infants was 14% (16 of 117). The incidence of subependymal cysts in infants exposed to cocaine prenatally was 44% (8 of 18) compared with 8% (8 of 99) in the unexposed group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased incidence of subependymal cyst formation in preterm infants who were exposed to cocaine prenatally. This result is consistent with results of similar studies in term infants.
PURPOSE: Sotos syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized primarily by overgrowth, developmental delay, and a characteristic facial gestalt. Defects in the NSD1 gene are present in approximately 80% of patients with Sotos syndrome. The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of NSD1 abnormalities in patients referred to a clinical laboratory for testing and to identify clinical criteria that distinguish between patients with and without NSD1 abnormalities. METHODS: Deletion or mutation analysis of the NSD1 gene was performed on 435 patients referred to our clinical genetics laboratory. Detailed clinical information was obtained on 86 patients with and without NSD1 abnormalities, and a clinical checklist was developed to help distinguish between these two groups of patients. RESULTS: Abnormalities of the NSD1 gene were identified in 55 patients, including 9 deletions and 46 mutations. Thus, in the clinical laboratory setting, deletions were found in 2% and mutations in 21% of samples analyzed, because not all patients had both tests. Thirty-three previously unreported mutations in the NSD1 gene were identified. Clinical features typically associated with Sotos syndrome were not found to be significantly different between individuals with and without NSD1 abnormalities. The clinical checklist developed included poor feeding, increased body mass index, and enlarged cerebral ventricles, in addition to the typical clinical features of Sotos syndrome, and was able to distinguish between the two groups with 80% sensitivity and 70% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The dramatic decrease in the frequency of finding NSD1 abnormalities in the clinical laboratory is likely because of the heterogeneity of the patient population. Our experience from a diagnostic laboratory can help guide clinicians in deciding for whom NSD1 genetic analysis is indicated.
PURPOSE: Symptomatic visual field constriction thought to be associated with vigabatrin has been reported. The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known vigabatrin-attributed visual field loss, three of whom were reported previously. Six of the patients were no longer receiving vigabatrin. METHODS: The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer. Full visual electrophysiology, including flash electroretinography (ERG), pattern electroretinography, multifocal ERG using the VERIS system, electro-oculography, and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, was undertaken. RESULTS: Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field. The eighth exhibited concentric constriction. Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits; two patients had subnormal Arden electro-oculography indices; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave. However, five patients showed delayed 30-Hz flicker b waves, and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials. Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level. CONCLUSION: Marked visual field constriction appears to be associated with vigabatrin therapy. The field defects and some electrophysiological abnormalities persist when vigabatrin therapy is withdrawn.
PURPOSE: The anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use. Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) is recommended for protection against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays. Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done. RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention. Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dexrazoxane. Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity. If successful, this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy.
PURPOSE: The autosomal dominant Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is characterized by upper limb and cardiac septal defects. Mutations of the TBX5 gene have been identified as the underlying gene defect in HOS. Embryonic expression of TBX5 has been found in the human retina. This is the first report of ocular findings in two unrelated families with mutations in the TBX5 gene. METHODS: Six living persons affected with HOS and 10 unaffected family members were subjected to mutation analysis and complete ophthalmological examination, including electrophysiological examinations (EOG and flash ERG). RESULTS: A heterozygous single base-pain substitution in exon 5 (408C --> A) was detected in all affected patients. All examined affected patents were ophthalmological asymptomatic with normal EOG. A scotopic elongated b-wave latency was found in affected family members who were older than 35 years. The ERG was normal in the young patients. CONCLUSIONS: Haploinsufficiency of TBX5 alters the dorsal-ventral polarity in developing eye vesicles without amy detected functional loss in human. Slight ERG abnormalities later in life may be a result of changes induced by the inner ganglion cell layer in the inner nuclear layer.
PURPOSE: The case of an oncology patient who developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT) and was treated with argatroban plus catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) with alteplase is presented. SUMMARY: A 63-year-old Caucasian man with renal amyloidosis undergoing peripheral blood stem cell collection for an autologous stem cell transplant developed extensive bilateral upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism secondary to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. A continuous i.v. infusion of argatroban was initiated, and the patient was managed on the general medical floor. After one week of therapy, he was transferred to the intensive care unit with cardiopulmonary compromise related to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. A percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy and CDT with alteplase were attempted, but the procedure was aborted due to epistaxis. The epistaxis resolved the next day, and the patient was restarted on argatroban. A second percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy was performed six days later and resulted in partial revascularization of the SVC and central veins. Postthrombectomy continuous CDT with alteplase was commenced while argatroban was withheld, and complete patency of the SVC and central veins was achieved after three days of therapy. Alteplase was discontinued, and the patient was reinitiated on argatroban; ultimately, he was transitioned to warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. Although the patient recovered, he experienced permanent vision and hearing loss, as well as end-stage renal disease. CONCLUSION: A 63-year-old man with renal amyloidosis and SVC syndrome secondary to HITT was successfully treated with argatroban and CDT with alteplase.
PURPOSE: The influence of an irreversible inhibitor of constitutive NO synthase (L-NOArg; 1.0 mg/kg ip), a relatively selective inhibitor of inducible NO synthase (L-NIL; 1.0 mg/kg ip) and a relatively specific inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase (7-NI; 0.1 mg/kg ip), on antihyperalgesic action of selective antagonists of B2 and B1 receptors: D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8] bradykinin (HOE 140; 70 nmol/kg ip) or des Arg10 HOE 140 (70 nmol/kg ip) respectively, in model of diabetic (streptozotocin-induced) and toxic (vincristine-induced) neuropathy was investigated. METHODS: The changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli--the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall-Selitto. RESULTS: The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of bradykinin receptors and inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase activity reduces diabetic hyperalgesia. Pretreatment with L-NOArg and L-NIL but not 7-NI, significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both HOE 140 and des Arg10 HOE 140. It was also shown that both products of inducible NO synthase and neuronal NO synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine. Moreover, L-NOArg and 7-NI but not L-NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of HOE 140 or des-Arg10HOE 140 in toxic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and toxic neuropathy. In streptozotocin-induced hyperalgesia, inducible NO synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of bradykinin, whereas in vincristine-induced hyperalgesia bradykinin seemed to activate neuronal NO synthase pathway. Therefore, concomitant administration of small doses of bradykinin receptor antagonists and NO synthase inhibitors can be effective in alleviation of neuropathic pain, even in hospital care.
PURPOSE: The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB). MRP2 is absent in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2-deficient rats with those in transport-competent Wistar rats. By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB. However, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur. This prompted us to study the brain expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the BBB, in TR(-) rats compared with nonmutant (wild-type) Wistar rats. METHODS: The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR(-) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219, respectively. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in TR(-) rats. TR(-) rats exhibited a significant up-regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild-type controls. No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections. A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine-induced seizures in wild-type Wistar rats. Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR(-) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB. CONCLUSIONS: The data on TR(-) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB. Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB. Furthermore, our data suggest that TR(-) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp-enhancing events for this purpose.
PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to explore the function of P2X3 and NK1 receptors antagonists on cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis in rats. METHODS: Sixty female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups. The rats in the control group were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 0.9% saline (4 ml/kg); the rats in the model group were i.p. injected with CYP (150 mg/kg); and the rats in the intervention group were i.p. injected with CYP with subsequently perfusion of bladder with P2X3 and NK1 receptors' antagonists, Suramin and GR 82334. Spontaneous pain behaviors following the administration of CYP were observed. Urodynamic parameters, bladder pressure-volume curve, maximum voiding pressure (MVP), and maximum cystometric capacity (MCC), were recorded. Pathological changes in bladder tissue were observed. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of P2X3 and NK1 receptors in bladder. RESULTS: Cyclophosphamide treatment increased the spontaneous pain behaviors scores. The incidence of bladder instability during urine storage period of model group was significantly higher than intervention group (X(2) = 7.619, P = 0.007) and control group (X(2) = 13.755, P = 0.000). MCC in the model group was lower than the control and intervention groups (P < 0.01). Histological changes evident in model and intervention groups rats' bladder included edema, vasodilation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. In model group, the expression of P2X3 receptor increased in urothelium and suburothelium, and NK1 receptor increased in suburothelium, while the expression of them in intervention group was lower. CONCLUSIONS: In CYP-induced cystitis, the expression of P2X3 and NK1 receptors increased in urothelium and/or suburothelium. Perfusion of bladder with P2X3 and NK1 receptors antagonists ameliorated the bladder function.
PURPOSE: This paper reviews the effect of chronic lithium therapy on serum calcium level and parathyroid glands, its pathogenesis, and treatment options. We examined the case of a lithium-treated patient who had recurrent hypercalcemia to better understand the disease process. CONCLUSION: Primary hyperparathyroidism is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of long-term lithium therapy. Careful patient selection and long-term follow-up can reduce morbidity. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: As much as 15% of lithium-treated patients become hypercalcemic. By routinely monitoring serum calcium levels, healthcare providers can improve the quality of life of this patient group.
PURPOSE: This retrospective study used a pharmaceutical company's global safety database to determine the reporting rate of hyponatremia and/or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) among vincristine-treated patients and to explore the possibility of at-risk population subgroups. METHOD: We searched the Eli Lilly and Company's computerized adverse event database for all reported cases of hyponatremia and/or SIADH as of 1 November 1999 that had been reported during the use of vincristine. RESULTS: A total of 76 cases of hyponatremia and/or SIADH associated with vincristine use were identified. The overall reporting rate was estimated to be 1.3/100,000 treated patients. The average age of patients was 35.6 +/- 28.3 years, and 62% were males. Approximately 75% of the patients were receiving treatment for leukemia or lymphoma. Among the 39 reports that included information on race, the racial distribution was: 1 Black, 3 Caucasian, and 35 Asian. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Asian patients may be at increased risk of hyponatremia and/or SIADH associated with vincristine use. Although the overall reported rate of SIADH associated with vincristine is very low, physicians caring for Asian oncology patients should be aware of this potential serious but reversible adverse event.
PURPOSE: This study was designed to establish a rat model of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) by calcium chloride (CaCl(2))-induced arterial injury and to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs) in TAA formation. METHODS: Thoracic aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats was exposed to 0.5M CaCl(2) or normal saline (NaCl). After 12weeks, animals were euthanized, and CaCl(2)-treated, CaCl(2)-untreated (n=12) and NaCl-treated aortic segments (n=12) were collected for histological and molecular assessments. MMP-TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi-quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Despite similar external diameters among CaCl(2)-treated, non-CaCl(2)-treated and NaCl-treated segments, aneurymal alteration (n=6, 50%), media degeneration with regional disruption, fragmentation of elastic fiber, and increased collagen deposition (n=12, 100%) were demonstrated in CaCl(2)-treated segments. MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 mRNA levels were increased in CaCl(2)-treated segments (all p<0.01), with trends of elevation in CaCl(2)-untreated segments, as compared with NaCl-treated segments. Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 (all p<0.01) in intima and media for CaCl(2)-treated segments. TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments. CONCLUSION: This study establishes a TAA model by periarterial CaCl(2) exposure in rats, and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling.
PURPOSE: To assess by electrophysiologic testing the effect of photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) on the retina and optic nerve. SETTING: Eye Clinic, S. Salvatore Hospital, L'Aquila University, Italy. METHODS: Standard pattern electroretinograms (P-ERGs) and standard pattern visual evoked potentials (P-VEPs) were done in 25 eyes of 25 patients who had myopic PRK for an attempted correction between 5.00 and 15.00 diopters (D) (mean 8.00 D). Testing was done preoperatively and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively. The contralateral eyes served as controls. During the follow-up, 3 patients (12%) developed steroid-induced elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) that resolved after corticosteroid therapy was discontinued. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were seen between treated and control eyes nor between treated eyes preoperatively and postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Myopic excimer laser PRK did not seem to affect the posterior segment. The transient steroid-induced IOP rise did not seem to cause functional impairment.
PURPOSE: To assess the antiemetic effects and safety profile of four different doses of granisetron (Kytril; SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) when administered as a single intravenous (IV) dose for prophylaxis of cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-four chemotherapy-naive patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (81 to 120 mg/m2) were randomized to receive one of four granisetron doses (5, 10, 20, or 40 micrograms/kg) administered before chemotherapy. Patients were observed on an inpatient basis for 18 to 24 hours, and vital signs, nausea, vomiting, retching, and appetite were assessed. Safety analyses included incidence of adverse experiences and laboratory parameter changes. RESULTS: After granisetron doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40 micrograms/kg, a major response (< or = two vomiting or retching episodes, and no antiemetic rescue) was recorded in 23%, 57%, 58%, and 60% of patients, respectively, and a complete response (no vomiting or retching, and no antiemetic rescue) in 18%, 41%, 40%, and 47% of patients, respectively. There was a statistically longer time to first episode of nausea (P = .0015) and vomiting (P = .0001), and fewer patients were administered additional antiemetic medication in the 10-micrograms/kg dosing groups than in the 5-micrograms/kg dosing group. As granisetron dose increased, appetite return increased (P = .040). Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event (20%). CONCLUSION: A single 10-, 20-, or 40-micrograms/kg dose of granisetron was effective in controlling vomiting in 57% to 60% of patients who received cisplatin at doses greater than 81 mg/m2 and totally prevented vomiting in 40% to 47% of patients. There were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between the 10-micrograms/kg dose and the 20- and 40-micrograms/kg doses. Granisetron was well tolerated at all doses.
PURPOSE: To assess the effect of pupil dilation on vision and driving ability. METHODS: A series of tests on various parameters of visual function and driving simulator performance were performed on 12 healthy drivers, before and after pupil dilation using guttae tropicamide 1%. A driving simulator (Transport Research Laboratory) was used to measure reaction time (RT), speed maintenance and steering accuracy. Tests of basic visual function included high- and low-contrast visual acuity (HCVA and LCVA), Pelli-Robson contrast threshold (CT) and Goldmann perimetry (FIELDS). Useful Field of View (UFOV--a test of visual attention) was also undertaken. The mean differences in the pre- and post-dilatation measurements were tested for statistical significance at the 95% level using one-tail paired t-tests. RESULTS: Pupillary dilation resulted in a statistically significant deterioration in CT and HCVA only. Five of 12 drivers also exhibited deterioration in LCVA, CT and RT. Little evidence emerged for deterioration in FIELDS and UFOV. Also, 7 of 12 drivers appeared to adjust their driving behaviour by reducing their speed on the driving simulator, leading to improved steering accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary dilation may lead to a decrease in vision and daylight driving performance in young people. A larger study, including a broader spectrum of subjects, is warranted before guidelines can be recommended.
PURPOSE: To assess the incidence of postoperative emetic side effects after the administration of methylprednisolone and gentamicin into the posterior sub-Tenon's space at the end of routine cataract surgery. SETTING: St. Luke's Hospital, Gwardamangia, Malta. METHODS: A double-blind double-armed prospective study comprised 40 patients who had uneventful sutureless phacoemulsification under sub-Tenon's local infiltration of 3 mL of plain lignocaine. At the end of the procedure, Group A (n = 20) had 20 mg/0.5 mL of methylprednisolone and 10 mg/0.5 mL of gentamicin injected into the posterior sub-Tenon's space and Group B (n = 20) had the same combination injected into the anterior sub-Tenon's space. Postoperatively, all patients were assessed for symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and headache. A chi-square test was used to assess the statistical significance of results. RESULTS: Sixty percent in Group A developed postoperative emetic symptoms, headache, or both; 1 patient in Group B developed symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of methylprednisolone and gentamicin in the posterior sub-Tenon's space was related to a high incidence of side effects including nausea, vomiting, and headache. All adverse effects were self-limiting.
PURPOSE: To demonstrate the association between ethambutol and optic neuropathy. METHOD: Thirteen patients who developed optic neuropathy after being treated with ethambutol for tuberculosis of the lung or lymph node at Siriraj Hospital between 1997 and 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical characteristics and initial and final visual acuity were analyzed to determine visual outcome. RESULTS: All patients had optic neuropathy between 1 to 6 months (mean = 2.9 months) after starting ethambutol therapy at a dosage ranging from 13 to 20 mg/kg/day (mean = 17 mg/kg/day). Seven (54%) of the 13 patients experienced visual recovery after stopping the drug. Of 6 patients with irreversible visual impairment, 4 patients had diabetes mellitus, glaucoma and a history of heavy smoking. CONCLUSION: Early recognition of optic neuropathy should be considered in patients with ethambutol therapy. A low dose and prompt discontinuation of the drug is recommended particularly in individuals with diabetes mellitus, glaucoma or who are heavy smokers.
PURPOSE: To determine the natural history of visual field defects in a group of patients known to have Vigabatrin-associated changes who elected to continue the medication because of good seizure control. METHODS: All patients taking Vigabatrin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs for at least 5 years (range 5-12 years) were entered into a visual surveillance programme. Patients were followed up at 6-monthly intervals for not less than 18 months (range 18-43 months). In all, 16 patients with unequivocal defects continued the medication. Following already published methodology (Eye 2002; 16;567-571) monocular mean radial degrees (MRDs) to the I/4e isopter on Goldmann perimetry was calculated for the right eye at the time of discovery of a visual field defect and again after not less than 18 months follow-up. RESULTS: Mean right eye MRD at presentation was 36.98 degrees (range 22.25-51.0), compared to 38.40 degrees (range 22.5-49.75) after follow-up; P=0.338 unpaired t-test. Only one patient demonstrated a deterioration in visual field during the study period and discontinued treatment. CONCLUSION: Established visual field defects presumed to be due to Vigabatrin therapy did not usually progress in spite of continuing use of the medication. These data give support to the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of Vigabatrin-associated visual field defects may be an idiosyncratic adverse drug reaction rather than dose-dependent toxicity.
PURPOSE: To determine whether Myocet (liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin; The Liposome Company, Elan Corporation, Princeton, NJ) in combination with cyclophosphamide significantly reduces doxorubicin cardiotoxicity while providing comparable antitumor efficacy in first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety-seven patients with MBC and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to receive either 60 mg/m(2) of Myocet (M) or conventional doxorubicin (A), in combination with 600 mg/m(2) of cyclophosphamide (C), every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cardiotoxicity was defined by reductions in left-ventricular ejection fraction, assessed by serial multigated radionuclide angiography scans, or congestive heart failure (CHF). Antitumor efficacy was assessed by objective tumor response rates (World Health Organization criteria), time to progression, and survival. RESULTS: Six percent of MC patients versus 21% (including five cases of CHF) of AC patients developed cardiotoxicity (P =.0002). Median cumulative doxorubicin dose at onset was more than 2,220 mg/m(2) for MC versus 480 mg/m(2) for AC (P =.0001, hazard ratio, 5.04). MC patients also experienced less grade 4 neutropenia. Antitumor efficacy of MC versus AC was comparable: objective response rates, 43% versus 43%; median time to progression, 5.1% versus 5.5 months; median time to treatment failure, 4.6 versus 4.4 months; and median survival, 19 versus 16 months. CONCLUSION: Myocet improves the therapeutic index of doxorubicin by significantly reducing cardiotoxicity and grade 4 neutropenia and provides comparable antitumor efficacy, when used in combination with cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy for MBC.
PURPOSE: To develop a model of visceral pain in rats using a behavioral approach. Cyclophosphamide (CP), an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite acrolein, was used to induce cystitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CP was administered at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg./kg. i.p. to male rats, and their behavior observed and scored. The effects of morphine (0.5 to 4 mg./kg. i.v.) on CP-induced behavioral modifications were tested administered alone and after naloxone (1 mg./kg. s.c.). In addition, 90 minutes after CP injection, that is, at the time of administration of morphine, the bladder was removed in some rats for histological examination. Finally, to show that the bladder is essential for the CP-induced behavioral modifications, female rats also received CP at doses of 200 mg./kg. i.p. and of 20 mg. by the intravesical route, and acrolein at doses of 0.5 mg. by the intravesical route and of 5 mg./kg. i.v. RESULTS: CP dose-relatedly induced marked behavioral modifications in male rats: breathing rate decrease, closing of the eyes and occurrence of specific postures. Morphine dose-dependently reversed these behavioral disorders. A dose of 0.5 mg./kg. produced a reduction of almost 50% of the behavioral score induced by CP 200 mg./kg. This effect was completely prevented by pretreatment with naloxone. At the time of administration of morphine, histological modifications of the bladder wall, such as chorionic and muscle layer edema, were observed. In female rats, CP 200 mg./kg. i.p. produced the same marked behavioral modifications as those observed in male rats. Administered at the dose of 20 mg. intravesically, CP did not produce any behavioral effects, whereas acrolein at 0.5 mg. intravesically induced behavioral modifications identical to those under CP 200 mg./kg. i.p., with the same maximal levels. Conversely, acrolein 5 mg./kg. i.v. did not produce any behavioral effects at all. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that this experimental model of CP-induced cystitis may be an interesting new behavioral model of inflammatory visceral pain, allowing a better understanding of these painful syndromes and thus a better therapeutic approach to them.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin (500 mg orally once daily for 10 to 14 days) in treating adult outpatients with acute bacterial sinusitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 329 patients enrolled in the study at 24 centers. All patients had a pre-therapy Gram's stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy. Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results. Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre-therapy pathogen(s). RESULTS: The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Of 300 clinically evaluable patients, 175 (58%) were cured and 90 (30%) were improved at the post-therapy evaluation, resulting in a clinical success rate of 88%. Thirty-five patients (12%) clinically failed treatment. The microbiologic eradication rate (presumed plus documented) among 138 microbiologically evaluable patients was 92%. Microbiologic eradication rates (presumed plus documented) of the most common pathogens ranged from 93% (M. catarrhalis) to 100% (S. pneumoniae) at the post-therapy visit. All but one of the 265 patients who were cured or improved at post-therapy returned for a long-term follow-up visit; 243 (92%) remained well 4 to 6 weeks after therapy; and 21 (8%) had a relapse of symptoms. Adverse events considered to be related to levofloxacin administration were reported by 29 patients (9%). The most common drug-related adverse events were diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea; most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that levofloxacin 500 mg once daily is an effective and safe treatment for acute bacterial sinusitis.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the frequency, severity and preventability of warfarin-induced cerebral haemorrhages due to warfarin and warfarin-drug interactions in patients living in the county of Osterg tland, Sweden. METHODS: All patients with a diagnosed cerebral haemorrhage at three hospitals during the period 2000-2002 were identified. Medical records were studied retrospectively to evaluate whether warfarin and warfarin-drug interactions could have caused the cerebral haemorrhage. The proportion of possibly avoidable cases due to drug interactions was estimated. RESULTS: Among 593 patients with cerebral haemorrhage, 59 (10%) were assessed as related to warfarin treatment. This imply an incidence of 1.7/100,000 treatment years. Of the 59 cases, 26 (44%) had a fatal outcome, compared to 136 (25%) among the non-warfarin patients (p < 0.01). A warfarin-drug interaction could have contributed to the haemorrhage in 24 (41%) of the warfarin patients and in 7 of these (12%) the bleeding complication was considered being possible to avoid. CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin-induced cerebral haemorrhages are a major clinical problem with a high fatality rate. Almost half of the cases was related to a warfarin-drug interaction. A significant proportion of warfarin-related cerebral haemorrhages might have been prevented if greater caution had been taken when prescribing drugs known to interact with warfarin.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the response rate and toxic effects of vinorelbine (VNB) administered as a single agent in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six eligible patients with measurable lesions were included and were stratified according to previous chemotherapy. Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were assessable for toxicity and response. VNB was administered weekly as a 25-mg/m2 short intravenous (i.v.) infusion. RESULTS: Six of 30 patients (20%) without prior chemotherapy achieved a partial response (PR) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8% to 39%). The median duration of response was 21 weeks (range, 17 to 28). One of 16 patients (6%) with prior chemotherapy had a complete response (CR) of 31 weeks' duration (95% CI, 0% to 30%). The overall response rate (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) was 15% (CR, 2%; PR 13%; 95% CI, 6% to 29%). The median dose-intensity (DI) was 20 mg/m2/wk. VNB was well tolerated and zero instances of WHO grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred. At least one episode of grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was seen in 59% of patients. A grade 2 or 3 infection occurred in 16% of patients, but no toxic deaths occurred. Other side effects were rare, and peripheral neurotoxicity has been minor (26% grade 1). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that VNB is an active agent in metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Given its excellent tolerance profile and low toxicity, further evaluation of VNB in combination therapy is warranted.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the responses of cultured oviduct mucosal cells to exogenous estradiol treatment in regulating the mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors. METHODS: The mucosal layer of the ampullary regions of the human oviduct was isolated and cultured with (study groups) or without (control group) the addition of exogenous estradiol in five different concentrations. Semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed on the oviduct mucosal cells before and after the 6-day culture. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the mRNA expression of VEGF and its receptors, both KDR and flt-1, between the five study groups and the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA expression of VEGF and its receptors is not altered by exogenous estradiol treatment in cultured oviduct. This helps to explain the mechanism of temporal regulation of VEGF in human oviduct, which reaches the peak level in the peri-ovulatory stage when both the serum estradiol and gonadotropins concentrations are high.
PURPOSE: To map and identify the pattern, in vivo, of axonal degeneration in ethambutol-induced optic neuropathy using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Ethambutol is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis. A serious complication of ethambutol is an optic neuropathy that impairs visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision. However, early on, when the toxic optic neuropathy is mild and partly reversible, the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss. METHODS: Three subjects with a history of ethambutol (EMB)-induced optic neuropathy of short-, intermediate-, and long-term visual deficits were administered a full neuro-ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination. In addition, OCT (OCT 3000, Humphrey-Zeiss, Dublin, CA) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) analysis protocol. OCT interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the RNFL. RESULTS: The results were compared to the calculated average RNFL of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using OCT, n=661. In all subjects with history of EMB-induced optic neuropathy, there was a mean loss of 72% nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant (patient A, with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields, 58% loss; patient B, with intermediate visual deficits, 68% loss; patient C, with chronic visual deficits, 90% loss), with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26+/-16 microm. There was a combined mean loss of 46% of fibers from the superior, inferior, and nasal quadrants in the (six) eyes of all three subjects (mean average thickness of 55+/-29 microm). In both sets (four) of eyes of the subjects with persistent visual deficits (patients B and C), there was an average loss of 79% of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant. CONCLUSIONS: The OCT results in these patients with EMB-induced optic neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers. This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo-cellular axons (or small-caliber axons) within the papillo-macular bundle in toxic or hereditary optic neuropathies. OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of optic neuropathies. Additionally, in terms of management of EMB-induced optic neuropathy, it is important to properly manage ethambutol dosing in patients with renal impairment and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached.
PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral optic neuropathy in a patient receiving tacrolimus (FK 506, Prograf; Fujisawa USA, Inc, Deerfield, Illinois) for immunosuppression after orthotropic liver transplantation. METHOD: Case report. In a 58-year-old man receiving tacrolimus after orthotropic liver transplantation, serial neuro-ophthalmologic examinations and laboratory studies were performed. RESULTS: The patient had episodic deterioration of vision in both eyes, with clinical features resembling ischemic optic neuropathies. Deterioration of vision occurred despite discontinuation of the tacrolimus. CONCLUSION: Tacrolimus and other immunosuppressive agents may be associated with optic nerve toxicity.
PURPOSE: To report the treatment outcomes of the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant (0.59 mg) in patients with birdshot retinochoroidopathy whose disease is refractory or intolerant to conventional immunomodulatory therapy. METHODS: A retrospective case series involving 11 birdshot retinochoroidopathy patients (11 eyes). Eleven patients (11 eyes) underwent surgery for fluocinolone acetonide implant (0.59 mg). Treatment outcomes of interest were noted at baseline, before fluocinolone acetonide implant, and then at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and beyond 3 years. Disease activity markers, including signs of ocular inflammation, evidence of retinal vasculitis, Swedish interactive threshold algorithm-short wavelength automated perimetry Humphrey visual field analysis, electroretinographic parameters, and optical coherence tomography were recorded. Data on occurrence of cataract and raised intraocular pressure were collected in all eyes. RESULTS: Intraocular inflammation was present in 54.5, 9.9, 11.1, and 0% of patients at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and beyond 3 years after receiving the implant, respectively. Active vasculitis was noted in 36.3% patients at baseline and 0% at 3 years of follow-up. More than 20% (47.61-67.2%) reduction in central retinal thickness was noted in all patients with cystoid macular edema at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postimplant. At baseline, 54.5% patients were on immunomodulatory agents. This percentage decreased to 45.45, 44.4, and 14.28% at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postimplant, respectively. Adverse events included increased intraocular pressure (54.5%) and cataract formation (100%). CONCLUSION: The data suggest that fluocinolone acetonide implant (0.59 mg) helps to control inflammation in otherwise treatment-refractory cases of birdshot retinochoroidopathy. It is associated with significant side effects of cataract and ocular hypertension requiring treatment.
PURPOSE: Topical beta-blocker treatment is routine therapy in the management of patients with glaucoma. Therapy results in systemic absorption, however, the degree of reduction of resting and peak heart rate has not been quantified. DESIGN: This trial evaluated the effect of placebo, 0.5% aqueous timolol (timolol solution) and a 0.5% timolol suspension that forms a gel on application to the conjunctiva (timolol gellan) on the 24-hour heart rate in patients currently being treated for glaucoma to quantify the reduction in mean heart rate. METHODS: Forty-three Caucasian patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with a mean (+/-SD) age of 63 (+/-8) years were randomized and crossed over in a double-masked manner to 14 days of treatment with placebo (morning and evening in both eyes), timolol solution (morning and evening in both eyes), or timolol gellan (morning in both eyes with placebo in the evening). On the 13th day of each period, heart rate was recorded continuously during a typical, ambulant 24-hour period. RESULTS: Both timolol solution and timolol gellan reduced the mean 24-hour heart rate compared with placebo (P < or = .001), and this reduction was most pronounced during the daytime (-7.5% change in mean heart rate, -5.7 beats/min). Timolol gellan showed a numerically but not significantly smaller reduction in 24-hour heart rate, compared with timolol solution. During the night, the mean 12-hour heart rate on placebo and timolol gellan were both significantly less than on timolol solution; the difference between solution and gellan treatments was statistically significant (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Both timolol solution and timolol gellan decrease the mean 24-hour heart rate compared with placebo. This response was most pronounced during the active daytime period. These data quantify the modest bradycardia associated with ophthalmic beta-blocker therapy in a typical patient population on therapy for glaucoma. Although exercise performance was not assessed in this trial, reductions of this magnitude should not have substantial clinical consequences.
PURPOSE: Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with 13-cis-retinoic acid (cis-RA) can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation. Since cis-RA has demonstrated clinical responses in neuroblastoma patients, it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therapy. This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal-tolerated dosage (MTD), toxicities, and pharmacokinetics of cis-RA administered on an intermittent schedule in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one assessable patients, 2 to 12 years of age, were treated with oral cis-RA administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period, for up to 12 courses. The dose was escalated from 100 to 200 mg/m2/d until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed. A single intrapatient dose escalation was permitted. RESULTS: The MTD of cis-RA was 160 mg/m2/d. Dose-limiting toxicities in six of nine patients at 200 mg/m2/d included hypercalcemia (n = 3), rash (n = 2), and anemia/thrombocytopenia/emesis/rash (n = 1). All toxicities resolved after cis-RA was discontinued. Three complete responses were observed in marrow metastases. Serum levels of 7.4 +/- 3.0 mumol/L (peak) and 4.0 +/- 2.8 mumol/L (trough) at the MTD were maintained during 14 days of therapy. The DLT correlated with serum levels > or = 10 mumol/L. CONCLUSION: The MTD of cis-RA given on this intermittent schedule was 160 mg/m2/d. Serum levels known to be effective against neuroblastoma in vitro were achieved at this dose. The DLT included hypercalcemia, and may be predicted by serum cis-RA levels. Monitoring of serum calcium and cis-RA levels is indicated in future trials.
PURPOSE: We evaluated the safety of indocyanine green for use in fundus angiography. METHODS: We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in Japan, which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company, which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera. RESULTS: Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded, reporting a total of 3,774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2,820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992. Before angiography, intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing, or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions. For three patients, the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing. The dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg, depending upon the institution. There were 13 cases of adverse reactions (0.34%), ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea, exanthema, urtication, itchiness, and urgency to defecate, and did not require treatment. Also recorded were one case of pain of the vein, which required treatment, and two cases of hypotension. The two hypotensive patients required treatment for shock. CONCLUSIONS: A comparison of frequency of adverse reactions to indocyanine green with the previously reported frequency of such reactions to fluorescein sodium indicated that indocyanine green is a safe as fluorescein for use in angiography.
PURPOSE: We gained knowledge of the etiology, treatment and prevention of cyclophosphamide associated urothelial cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 6 men and 6 women (mean age 55 years) with cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer were reviewed. RESULTS: All tumors were grade 3 or 4 transitional cell carcinoma. Of the 5 patients initially treated with endoscopic resection alone only 1 is alive without disease. Of the 6 patients who underwent early cystectomy 4 were alive at 24 to 111 months. The remaining patient with extensive cancer underwent partial cystectomy for palliation and died 3 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophosphamide associated bladder tumor is an aggressive disease. However, long-term survival is possible when radical cystectomy is performed for bladder tumors with any sign of invasion and for recurrent high grade disease, even when noninvasive.
PURPOSE: We present a case of a patient who developed seizures shortly after initiating treatment with levofloxacin and to discuss the potential drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 in this case, as well as in other cases, of levofloxacin-induced seizures. METHODS: Several biomedical databases were searched including MEDLINE, Cochrane and Ovid. The main search terms utilized were case report and levofloxacin. The search was limited to studies published in English. RESULTS: Six cases of levofloxacin-induced seizures have been reported in the literature. Drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of CYP1A2 by levofloxacin are likely involved in the clinical outcome of these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians are exhorted to pay close attention when initiating levofloxacin therapy in patients taking medications with epileptogenic properties that are CYP1A2 substrates.
PURPOSE: We report 4 cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse. The pathogenesis of these ulcers and management of these patients are also reviewed. METHODS: Review of all cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse seen at our institution from July 2006 to December 2006. RESULTS: Four patients with corneal ulcers associated with crack cocaine use were reviewed. All corneal ulcers were cultured, and the patients were admitted to the hospital for intensive topical antibiotic treatment. Each patient received comprehensive health care, including medical and substance abuse consultations. Streptococcal organisms were found in 3 cases and Capnocytophaga and Brevibacterium casei in 1 patient. The infections responded to antibiotic treatment. Two patients needed a lateral tarsorrhaphy for persistent epithelial defects. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosolized crack cocaine use can be associated with the development of corneal ulcers. Drug abuse provides additional challenges for management. Not only treatment of their infections but also the overall poor health of the patients and increased risk of noncompliance need to be addressed. Comprehensive care may provide the patient the opportunity to discontinue their substance abuse, improve their overall health, and prevent future corneal complications.
PURPOSE: We reviewed CFTR mutation distribution among Hispanic and African American individuals referred for CF carrier screening and compared mutation frequencies to those derived from CF patient samples. METHODS: Results from CFTR mutation analyses received from January 2001 through September 2003, were analyzed for four populations: Hispanic individuals with a CF diagnosis (n = 159) or carrier screening indication (n = 15,333) and African American individuals with a CF diagnosis (n = 108) or carrier screening indication (n = 8,973). All samples were tested for the same 87 mutation panel. RESULTS: In the Hispanic population, 42 mutations were identified: 30 in the patient population (77.5% detection rate) and 33 among carrier screening referrals. Five mutations not included in the ACMG/ACOG carrier screening panel (3876delA, W1089X, R1066C, S549N, 1949del84) accounted for 7.55% detection in patients and 5.58% among carriers. Among African American referrals, 33 different mutations were identified: 21 in the patient population (74.4% detection) and 23 in the carrier screening population. Together, A559T and 711+5G>A were observed at a detection rate of 3.71% in CF patients and 6.38% in carriers. The mutation distribution seen in both the carrier screening populations reflected an increased frequency of mutations with variable expression such as D1152H, R117H, and L206W. CONCLUSIONS: A detailed analysis of CFTR mutation distribution in the Hispanic and African American patient and carrier screening populations demonstrates that a diverse group of mutations is most appropriate for diagnostic and carrier screening in these populations. To best serve the increasingly diverse U.S. population, ethnic-specific mutations should be included in mutation panels.
PURPOSE: We reviewed the results of serum testosterone and prolactin determination in 1,022 patients referred because of erectile dysfunction and compared the data with history, results of physical examination, other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost-effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay. Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire, gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml. Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results. Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1,340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination. Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire, small testes and gynecomastia. Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia. RESULTS: Testosterone was less than 3 ng./ml. in 107 patients but normal in 40% at repeat determination. The prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age (4% before age 50 years and 9% 50 years or older). Two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination. Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction (definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%). Determining testosterone only in cases of low sexual desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low testosterone, including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy. Prolactin exceeded 20 ng./ml. in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination. Only 1 prolactinoma was discovered. These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades (overall prolactin greater than 20 ng./ml. in 1.86% of 1,821 patients, prolactinomas in 7, 0.38%). Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. (8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng./ml.). Testosterone was low in less than 50% of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. CONCLUSIONS: Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction cannot justify their routine determination. However, cost-effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50% of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors. We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years. Prolactin should be determined only in cases of low sexual desire, gynecomastia and/or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml.
Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) by 3-hour infusion was combined with carboplatin in a phase I/II study directed to patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Carboplatin was given at a fixed target area under the concentration-time curve of 6.0 by the Calvert formula, whereas paclitaxel was escalated in patient cohorts from 150 mg/m2 (dose level I) to 175, 200, 225, and 250 mg/m2. The 225 mg/m2 level was expanded for the phase II study since the highest level achieved (250 mg/m2) required modification because of nonhematologic toxicities (arthralgia and sensory neuropathy). Therapeutic effects were noted at all dose levels, with objective responses in 17 (two complete and 15 partial regressions) of 41 previously untreated patients. Toxicities were compared with a cohort of patients in a phase I trial of paclitaxel alone at identical dose levels. Carboplatin did not appear to add to the hematologic toxicities observed, and the paclitaxel/carboplatin combination could be dosed every 3 weeks.
Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different tumor types, notably ovarian and breast carcinoma. Two phase II trials of 24-hour paclitaxel infusions in chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported response rates of 21% and 24%. Leukopenia was dose limiting: as many as 62.5% of patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia. We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3-hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC. The 58 patients treated (41 men and 17 women) had a median age of 59 years (age range, 25 to 75) and a performance status of 0 through 2. Most patients (72.4%) had stage IV NSCLC. Paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication. Of 50 patients evaluable for response, 12 (24%) had partial remission, 26 (52%) had no change, and 12 had disease progression (24%). Hematologic toxicities were mild: only one patient (2%) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, while 29% had grade 1 or 2. Grade 1 or 2 polyneuropathy affected 56% of patients while only one (2%) experienced severe polyneuropathy. Similarly, grade 1 or 2 myalgia/arthralgia was observed in 63.2% of patients, but only 14.3% experienced grade 3 or 4. Nausea and vomiting were infrequent, with 14% of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2% experiencing grade 3 or 4. Paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3-hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24-hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. Further phase II studies with paclitaxel combined with other drugs active against NSCLC are indicated, and phase III studies comparing paclitaxel with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed.

Pain memory is thought to affect future pain sensitivity and thus contribute to clinical pain conditions. Systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental pain are sparse. In order to address long-term pain memory, nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of capsaicin (0.05, 1 and 20 microg, separated by 15 min breaks), each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals. Pain rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale (0-100) digitized at 1/s, either immediately online or one hour or one day after injection. Subjects also recalled their pains one week later. Capsaicin injection reliably induced a dose-dependent flare (p<0.001) without any difference within or across sessions. The strong burning pain decayed exponentially within a few minutes. Subjects were able to reliably discriminate pain magnitude and duration across capsaicin doses (both p<0.001), regardless of whether first-time ratings were requested immediately, after one hour or after one day. Pain recall after one week was similarly precise (magnitude: p<0.01, duration: p<0.05). Correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first-time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection (R(2)=0.79) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces. These results indicate a reliable memory for magnitude and duration of experimentally induced pain. The data further suggest that the consolidation of this memory is an important interim stage, and may take up to one day.
Pain not responsive to morphine is often problematic. Animal and clinical studies have suggested that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, such as ketamine, may be effective in improving opioid analgesia in difficult pain syndromes, such as neuropathic pain. A slow bolus of subhypnotic doses of ketamine (0.25 mg/kg or 0.50 mg/kg) was given to 10 cancer patients whose pain was unrelieved by morphine in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, double-dose study. Pain intensity on a 0 to 10 numerical scale; nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, and dry mouth, using a scale from 0 to 3 (not at all, slight, a lot, awful); Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (0-30); and arterial pressure were recorded before administration of drugs (T0) and after 30 minutes (T30), 60 minutes (T60), 120 minutes (T120), and 180 minutes (T180). Ketamine, but not saline solution, significantly reduced the pain intensity in almost all the patients at both doses. This effect was more relevant in patients treated with higher doses. Hallucinations occurred in 4 patients, and an unpleasant sensation ("empty head") was also reported by 2 patients. These episodes reversed after the administration of diazepam 1 mg intravenously. Significant increases in drowsiness were reported in patients treated with ketamine in both groups and were more marked with ketamine 0.50 mg/kg. A significant difference in MMSE was observed at T30 in patients who received 0.50 mg/kg of ketamine. Ketamine can improve morphine analgesia in difficult pain syndromes, such as neuropathic pain. However, the occurrence of central adverse effects should be taken into account, especially when using higher doses. This observation should be tested in studies of prolonged ketamine administration.

Palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity in skin fibroblasts from seven patients with unidentified defects of fatty acid oxidation was measured in the presence and absence of antibodies against medium-chain, long-chain, and very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (VLCAD). Two of the patients, 4-5 month old boys, were found to have a novel disease, VLCAD deficiency, as judged from the results of very low palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity and the lack of immunoreactivity toward antibody raised to purified VLCAD..
Palpable purpura is a concerning clinical finding in pediatric patients and can have many causes, including infectious and autoimmune processes. A rare cause, drug-induced vasculitis, may result from the production of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in response to a medication. We report a girl with Turner syndrome and Graves' disease who presented with palpable purpuric lesions. The diagnosis of propylthiouracil (PTU)-associated vasculitis was made by observation of consistent clinical features, the detection of elevated ANA and ANCA in the blood, and the observed clinical resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of PTU. Subsequent treatment of persistent hyperthyroidism with radioablation did not result in an exacerbation of the vasculitis, a complication described in prior case reports.

Papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis is an uncommon benign lesion that may occur sporadically or as a manifestation of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Neither immunohistochemical studies nor molecular genetic analyses of the VHL gene have been reported previously for this lesion. The authors describe two cases of clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis, both of which were initially confused with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Both lesions showed positive immunohistochemical staining for low and intermediate molecular weight keratins (Cam 5. 2 and AE1/AE3), EMA, vimentin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. Each was negative for CEA. Because clear cell papillary cystadenoma is similar to renal cell carcinoma histologically, and because both occur as components of the von Hippel-Lindau disease complex, the authors analyzed both cases for the presence of mutations in the VHL gene. A somatic VHL gene mutation was detected in one of the two tumors by polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Direct sequencing revealed a cytosine to thymine transition at nucleotide 694, resulting in the replacement of an arginine with a stop codon after the sixth amino acid of exon 3. As the VHL gene is believed to function as a tumor suppressor gene, VHL gene mutations may play a role in the initiation of tumorigenesis in sporadic cystadenomas of the epididymis.
Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and severe early onset periodontitis that results in the premature loss of the primary and secondary dentitions. A major gene locus for PLS has been mapped to a 2. 8 cM interval on chromosome 11q14. Correlation of physical and genetic maps of this interval indicate it includes at least 40 ESTs and six known genes including the lysosomal protease cathepsin C gene (CTSC). The CTSC message is expressed at high levels in a variety of immune cells including polymorphonuclear leucocytes, macrophages, and their precursors. By RT-PCR, we found CTSC is also expressed in epithelial regions commonly affected by PLS, including the palms, soles, knees, and oral keratinised gingiva. The 4. 7 kb CTSC gene consists of two exons. Sequence analysis of CTSC from subjects affected with PLS from five consanguineous Turkish families identified four different mutations. An exon 1 nonsense mutation (856C-- > T) introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid 286. Three exon 2 mutations were identified, including a single nucleotide deletion (2692delA) of codon 349 introducing a frameshift and premature termination codon, a 2 bp deletion (2673-2674delCT) that results in introduction of a stop codon at amino acid 343, and a G-- > A substitution in codon 429 (2931G-- > A) introducing a premature termination codon. All PLS patients were homozygous for cathepsin C mutations inherited from a common ancestor. Parents and sibs heterozygous for cathepsin C mutations do not show either the palmoplantar hyperkeratosis or severe early onset periodontitis characteristic of PLS. A more complete understanding of the functional physiology of cathepsin C carries significant implications for understanding normal and abnormal skin development and periodontal disease susceptibility
Papillon-Lefevre syndrome, or keratosis palmoplantaris with periodontopathia (PLS, MIM 245000), is an autosomal recessive disorder that is mainly ascertained by dentists because of the severe periodontitis that afflicts patients. Both the deciduous and permanent dentitions are affected, resulting in premature tooth loss. Palmoplantar keratosis, varying from mild psoriasiform scaly skin to overt hyperkeratosis, typically develops within the first three years of life. Keratosis also affects other sites such as elbows and knees. Most PLS patients display both periodontitis and hyperkeratosis. Some patients have only palmoplantar keratosis or periodontitis, and in rare individuals the periodontitis is mild and of late onset. The PLS locus has been mapped to chromosome 11q14-q21 (refs 7, 8, 9). Using homozygosity mapping in eight small consanguineous families, we have narrowed the candidate region to a 1. 2-cM interval between D11S4082 and D11S931. The gene (CTSC) encoding the lysosomal protease cathepsin C (or dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I) lies within this interval. We defined the genomic structure of CTSC and found mutations in all eight families. In two of these families we used a functional assay to demonstrate an almost total loss of cathepsin C activity in PLS patients and reduced activity in obligate carriers.

Partial cDNA and genomic clones of rat stem cell factor (SCF) have been isolated. Using probes based on the rat sequence, partial and full-length cDNA and genomic clones of human SCF have been isolated. Based on the primary structure of the 164 amino acid protein purified from BRL-3A cells, truncated forms of the rat and human proteins have been expressed in E. coli and mammalian cells and have been shown to possess biological activity. SCF is able to augment the proliferation of both myeloid and lymphoid hematopoietic progenitors in bone marrow cultures. SCF exhibits potent synergistic activities in conjunction with colony-stimulating factors, resulting in increased colony numbers and colony size.
Partial deficiency of 6-phosphogluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.31) of the erythrocytes was discovered as an autosomal dominant disorder. Hemolytic anemia occurred in an individual who had inherited both the gene for 6-phosphogluconolactonase deficiency and that for deficiency of a nonhemolytic variant of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49). It is proposed that the interaction of this hereditary erythrocyte abnormality with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may explain hemolysis in some other patients who have inherited polymorphic variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
Partial deletion 8q without Langer-Giedion syndrome: a recognisable syndrome.
Partial gene deletion is the major cause of mutation leading to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Partial gene duplication has also been recognized in a few cases. We have conducted a survey for duplication in 72 unrelated nondeletion patients, analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with clones representing the entire DMD cDNA. With careful quantitative analysis of hybridization band intensity, 10 cases were found to carry a duplication of part of the gene, a frequency of 14% for nondeletion cases (10/72), or 6% for all cases (10/181). The extent of these duplications has been characterized according to the published exon-containing HindIII fragment map, and in six of the 10 duplications a novel restriction fragment that spanned the duplication junction was detected. The resulting translational reading frame of mRNA has been predicted for nine duplications. A shift of the reading frame was predicted in four of the six DMD cases and in one of the two intermediate cases, while the reading frame remained uninterrupted in both BMD cases. RFLP and quantitative Southern blot analyses revealed a grandpaternal origin of duplication in four families and grandmaternal origin in one family. In all five families, the duplication was found to originate from a single X chromosome. Unequal sister-chromatid exchange is proposed to be the mechanism for the formation of these duplications..
Partial lesions were made with kainic acid in the interpeduncular nucleus of the ventral midbrain of the rat. Compared with sham-operated controls, lesions significantly (p < 0.25) blunted the early (<60 min) free-field locomotor hypoactivity caused by nicotine (0.5 mg kg(-1), i.m.), enhanced the later (60-120 min) nicotine-induced hyperactivity, and raised spontaneous nocturnal activity. Lesions reduced the extent of immunohistological staining for choline acetyltransferase in the interpeduncular nucleus (p <0.025), but not for tyrosine hydroxylase in the surrounding catecholaminergic A10 region. We conclude that the interpeduncular nucleus mediates nicotinic depression of locomotor activity and dampens nicotinic arousal mechanisms located elsewhere in the brain.
Participants in the Medical Research Council treatment trial for mild hypertension are randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups: bendrofluazide, propranolol, or a placebo for either of these drugs. The trial is single-blind. 23 582 patient-years of observation have been completed so far, 10 684 on active drugs and 12 898 on placebos. The results show an association between bendrofluazide treatment and impotence, and impotence also occurred more frequently in patients taking propranolol than in those taking placebos. Other adverse reactions significantly linked with active drugs include impaired glucose tolerance in men and women and gout in men, associated with bendrofluazide treatment, and Raynaud's phenomenon and dyspnoea in men and women taking propranolol. No corneal disease is known to have occurred in the propranolol group. Mean serum potassium level fell, and urea and uric acid levels rose, in men and women taking bendrofluazide. In the propranolol group, serum potassium and uric acid levels rose in both sexes, but the urea level rose significantly in women only.

Pathogens, inflammatory signals, and stress cause acute transcriptional responses in cells. The induced expression of genes in response to these signals invariably involves transcription factors of the NF-kappaB and AP-1/ATF families. Activation of NF-kappaB factors is thought to be mediated primarily via IkappaB kinases (IKK), whereas that of AP-1/ATF can be mediated by stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs; also named Jun kinases or JNKs). IKKalpha and IKKbeta are two catalytic subunits of a core IKK complex that also contains the regulatory subunit NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator)/IKKgamma. The latter protein is essential for activation of the IKKs, but its mechanism of action is not known. Here we describe the molecular cloning of CIKS (connection to IKK and SAPK/JNK), a previously unknown protein that directly interacts with NEMO/IKKgamma in cells. When ectopically expressed, CIKS stimulates IKK and SAPK/JNK kinases and it transactivates an NF-kappaB-dependent reporter. Activation of NF-kappaB is prevented in the presence of kinase-deficient, interfering mutants of the IKKs. CIKS may help to connect upstream signaling events to IKK and SAPK/JNK modules. CIKS could coordinate the activation of two stress-induced signaling pathways, functions reminiscent of those noted for tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor adaptor proteins.

Patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation are generally immunosuppressed with a dose of cyclophosphamide (CYA) which is usually calculated based on the patient's weight. At these high doses of CYA, serious cardiotoxicity may occur, but definitive risk factors for the development of such cardiotoxicity have not been described. Since chemotherapeutic agent toxicity generally correlates with dose per body surface area, we retrospectively calculated the dose of CYA in patients transplanted at our institution to determine whether the incidence of CYA cardiotoxicity correlated with the dose per body surface area. Eighty patients who were to receive CYA 50 mg/kg/d for four days as preparation for marrow grafting underwent a total of 84 transplants for aplastic anemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, or severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome. Fourteen of 84 (17%) patients had symptoms and signs consistent with CYA cardiotoxicity within ten days of receiving 1 to 4 doses of CYA. Six of the 14 patients died with congestive heart failure. The dose of CYA per body surface area was calculated for all patients and the patients were divided into two groups based on daily CYA dose: Group 1, CYA less than or equal to 1.55 g/m2/d; Group 2, CYA greater than 1.55 g/m2/d. Cardiotoxicity that was thought to be related to CYA occurred in 1/32 (3%) of patients in Group 1 and in 13/52 (25%) patients in Group 2 (P less than 0.025). Congestive heart failure caused or contributed to death in 0/32 patients in Group 1 v 6/52 (12%) of patients in Group 2 (P less than 0.25). There was no difference in the rate of engraftment of evaluable patients in the two groups (P greater than 0.5). We conclude that the CYA cardiotoxicity correlates with CYA dosage as calculated by body surface area, and that patients with aplastic anemia and immunodeficiencies can be effectively prepared for bone marrow grafting at a CYA dose of 1.55 g/m2/d for four days with a lower incidence of cardiotoxicity than patients whose CYA dosage is calculated based on weight. This study reaffirms the principle that drug toxicity correlates with dose per body surface area.
Patients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa often show decreased expression of type XVII collagen, a transmembrane hemidesmosomal protein encoded by COL17A1. This report documents a novel splice-site mutation in COL17A1 in a patient with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa, and applies a new methodology to define and characterize the resulting mRNA splice variants. Mutational analysis of COL17A1 identified a maternally inherited G-to-T transversion at the -1 position of exon 32. This acceptor splice-site mutation led to the formation of aberrant transcripts present at extremely low levels. Based on our recent finding that cycloheximide stabilized mutant COL17A1 transcripts in keratinocytes homozygous for a frameshift mutation, the effects of the splice-site mutation on splicing of COL17A1 transcripts were determined using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of total RNA from keratinocytes incubated for 2. 5 h in the presence or absence of 10 microg cycloheximide per ml. Using this approach, an abnormally spliced transcript was identified that contains an extra 264 bases upstream from exon 32, resulting in a premature termination codon 27 bp downstream from the cryptic splice site. Three other splice variants, including one derived from the skipping of exon 32, were also identified. These results indicate the usefulness of cycloheximide treatment in evaluating the abnormal processing of mRNA due to splice-site mutations, because (i) aberrant splicing often generates a premature termination codon, (ii) transcripts with premature termination codons can occur at low or undetectable levels due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and (iii) the levels of these transcripts can be increased by cycloheximide.
Patients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa, a usually nonlethal form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, have generalized blistering, nail dystrophy, patchy alopecia, and dental abnormalities. Skin fragility in most cases is due to mutations in the gene encoding type XVII collagen (COL17A1). Recently, we reported five Austrian families with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa who share the same COL17A1 mutation. Affected individuals in three families are homozygous for 4003delTC, whereas those in two others are compound heterozygotes. To determine if the occurrence of 4003delTC in these unrelated families signifies propagation of an ancestral allele or a mutational hot spot, haplotypes were determined for polymorphisms both within and flanking COL17A1. Five intragenic polymorphisms were chosen based on their informativeness. One of these, not previously reported, was 2988 A or C that introduces a new restriction site for Eco0109 I. All the 4003delTC alleles showed the same haplotype for these five polymorphic markers. Fourteen microsatellite polymorphisms were selected based on their high heterozygosity and their location within 10q23-q25 near COL17A1. Three families shared microsatellite polymorphisms covering at most 19 cM, whereas the others shared smaller regions consistent with cross-over events during passage of this mutation through several generations. These results indicate that 4003delTC occurs on a single ancestral allele..
Patients with the Denys-Drash syndrome (Wilms tumor, genital anomalies, and nephropathy) have been demonstrated to carry de novo constitutional mutations in WT1, the Wilms tumor gene at chromosome 11p13. We report three new cases, two carrying a previously described WT1 exon 9 mutation and one with a novel WT1 exon 8 mutation. However, unlike patients in previous reports, one of our three patients inherited the affected allele from his phenotypically unaffected father. This observation indicates that the WT1 exon 9 mutation affecting 394Arg demonstrated in over one-half of the patients with the Denys-Drash syndrome may exhibit incomplete penetrance. Consequently, familial studies in patients affected by this syndrome are recommended..

Pediatric alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is characterized by a chromosomal translocation that fuses parts of the PAX3 and FKHR genes. PAX3 codes for a transcriptional regulator that controls developmental programs, and FKHR codes for a forkhead-winged helix protein, also a likely transcription factor. The PAX3-FKHR fusion product retains the DNA binding domains of the PAX3 protein and the putative activator domain of the FKHR protein. The PAX3-FKHR protein has been shown to function as a transcriptional activator. Using the RCAS retroviral vector, we have introduced the PAX3-FKHR gene into chicken embryo fibroblasts. Expression of the PAX3-FKHR protein in these cells leads to transformation the cells become enlarged, grow tightly packed and in multiple layers, and acquire the ability for anchorage-independent growth. This cellular transformation in vitro will facilitate studies on the mechanism of PAX3-FKHR-induced oncogenesis..

Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD) is an X-linked developmental defect of myelination affecting the central nervous system and segregating with the proteolipoprotein (PLP) locus. Investigating 82 strictly selected sporadic cases of PMD, we found PLP mutations in 77%; complete PLP-gene duplications were the most frequent abnormality (62%), whereas point mutations in coding or splice-site regions of the gene were involved less frequently (38%). We analyzed the maternal status of 56 cases to determine the origin of both types of PLP mutation, since this is relevant to genetic counseling. In the 22 point mutations, 68% of mothers were heterozygous for the mutation, a value identical to the two-thirds of carrier mothers that would be expected if there were an equal mutation rate in male and female germ cells. In sharp contrast, among the 34 duplicated cases, 91% of mothers were carriers, a value significantly (chi2 = 9. 20, P <. 01) in favor of a male bias, with an estimation of the male/female mutation frequency (k) of 9. 3 3. Moreover, we observed the occurrence of de novo mutations between parental and grandparental generations in 17 three-generation families, which allowed a direct estimation of the k value (k = 11). Again, a significant male mutation imbalance was observed only for the duplications.
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is a rare, sex-linked recessive, dysmyelinating disease of the central nervous system that has been associated with mutations in the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) gene. Only 25% of patients studied with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease have exonic mutations in this gene, the underlying cause of the disease in the remaining patients is unknown. The PLP gene encodes two major alternatively spliced transcripts called PLP and DM20. PLP messenger RNA is specifically expressed in central nervous system tissue, whereas DM20 messenger RNA is found in central nervous system, cardiac, and other tissues. We studied cultured skin fibroblasts from 2 brothers with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease who exhibited no detectable exonic mutation of the PLP gene. Examination of RNA from these cells showed that the level of DM20 messenger RNA is elevated sixfold relative to male control skin fibroblasts. An unrelated female carrier, also with no detectable exonic mutation, showed a threefold increase in DM20 messenger RNA in cultured skin fibroblasts. Our findings suggest that in some patients, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is caused by overexpression of PLP gene transcripts, and that in these families a 50% increase of DM20 messenger RNA in females, relative to the increase in affected males, can identify a female carrier..

Pendred syndrome comprises congenital sensorineural hearing loss, thyroid goiter, and positive perchlorate discharge test. Recently, this autosomal recessive disorder was shown to be caused by mutations in the PDS gene, which encodes an anion transporter called pendrin. Molecular analysis of the PDS gene was performed in two consanguineous large families from Southern Tunisia comprising a total of 23 individuals affected with profound congenital deafness; the same missense mutation, L445W, was identified in all affected individuals. A widened vestibular aqueduct was found in all patients who underwent computed tomography (CT) scan exploration of the inner ear. In contrast, goiter was present in only 11 affected individuals, who interestingly had a normal result of the perchlorate discharge test whenever performed. The present results question the sensitivity of the perchlorate test for the diagnosis of Pendred syndrome and support the use of a molecular analysis of the PDS gene in the assessment of individuals with severe to profound congenital hearing loss associated with inner ear morphological anomaly even in the absence of a thyroid goiter..
Pendred syndrome is a recessive inherited disorder that consists of developmental abnormalities of the cochlea, sensorineural hearing loss, and diffuse thyroid enlargement (goiter). This disorder may account for up to 10% of cases of hereditary deafness. The disease gene (PDS) has been mapped to chromosome 7q22-q31, and encodes a chloride-iodide transport protein. We performed mutation analysis of individual exons of the PDS gene in one Spanish family that shows intrafamilial variability of the deafness phenotype (two patients with profound and one with moderate-severe deafness). We identified a new splice-site mutation affecting intron 4 of the PDS gene, at nucleotide position 639 + 7. RNA analysis from lymphocytes of the affected patients showed that mutation 639 + 7A-- > G generates a new donor splice site, leading to an mRNA with an insertion of six nucleotides from intron 4 of PDS. Since the newly created donor splice site is likely to compete with the normal one, variations of the levels of normal and aberrant transcripts of the PDS gene in the cochlea may explain the variability in the deafness presentation..
Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early childhood deafness and goiter. A century after its recognition as a syndrome by Vaughan Pendred, the disease gene (PDS) was mapped to chromosome 7q22-q31. 1 and, recently, found to encode a putative sulfate transporter. We performed mutation analysis of the PDS gene in patients from 14 Pendred families originating from seven countries and identified all mutations. The mutations include three single base deletions, one splice site mutation and 10 missense mutations. One missense mutation (L236P) was found in a homozygous state in two consanguineous families and in a heterozygous state in five additional non-consanguineous families. Another missense mutation (T416P) was found in a homozygous state in one family and in a heterozygous state in four families. Pendred patients in three non-consanguineous families were shown to be compound heterozygotes for L236P and T416P. In total, one or both of these mutations were found in nine of the 14 families analyzed. The identification of two frequent PDS mutations will facilitate the molecular diagnosis of Pendred syndrome.
Pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness and characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goitre. This disorder was mapped to chromosome 7 and the gene causing Pendred syndrome (PDS) was subsequently identified by positional cloning. PDS encodes a putative transmembrane protein designated pendrin. Pendrin is closely related to a family of sulfate transport proteins that includes the rat sulfate-anion transporter (encoded by Sat-1; 29% amino acid sequence identity), the human diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter (encoded by DTD; 32%) and the human sulfate transporter downregulated in adenoma (encoded by DRA; 45%). On the basis of this homology and the presence of a slightly modified sulfate-transporter signature sequence comprising its putative second transmembrane domain, pendrin has been proposed to function as a sulfate transporter. We were unable to detect evidence of sulfate transport following the expression of pendrin in Xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjection of PDS cRNA or in Sf9 cells following infection with PDS-recombinant baculovirus. The rates of transport for iodide and chloride were significantly increased following the expression of pendrin in both cell systems. Our results demonstrate that pendrin functions as a transporter of chloride and iodide, but not sulfate, and may provide insight into thyroid physiology and the pathophysiology of Pendred syndrome..
Pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness, characterized by dyshormonogenic goiter associated with sensory-neural deafness. The gene responsible for the disease (PDS) has been cloned, but its function is as yet unknown and the connection between thyroid goiter and sensory-neural deafness remains an enigma. PDS codes for a novel protein, pendrin, which is closely related to a number of sufate transporters. Mechanisms by which abnormal sulfate transport could deleteriously affect iodide organification have been proposed. We tested sulfate transport in thyrocytes obtained from Pendred syndrome patients and found that it was not defective. This suggests that pendrin in fact may not be a sulfate transporter, and emphasizes the importance of functional studies on this novel protein..

Penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for epilepsy research. In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i.p. urethane and connected to an electrocorticogram setup. After a short period of basal activity recording, epileptic focus was induced by injecting 400IU/2 microl penicillin-G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded. Basal activity, latent period and the penicillin-induced epileptiform activity periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis. Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta, theta (slow and fast), alpha-sigma, beta (1 and 2) and gamma (1 and 2) bands. Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during the epileptiform activity and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes (basal activity, latent period and epileptiform activity). Our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this or other types of experimental epilepsies.
Pentamidine isethionate has been associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including torsade de pointes. This article reports two cases of this complication and reviews all reported cases to date. Pentamidine-induced torsade de pointes may be related to serum magnesium levels and hypomagnesemia may synergistically induce torsade. Torsade de pointes occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with pentamidine. In these patients, no other acute side effects of pentamidine were observed. Torsade de pointes can be treated when recognized early, possibly without discontinuation of pentamidine. When QTc interval prolongation is observed, early magnesium supplementation is advocated.

Perceived pain intensity is modulated by attention. However, it is not known that how pain intensity ratings are affected by attention in capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia. Here we show that perceived pain intensity in secondary hyperalgesia is decreased when attention is distracted away from the painful pinprick stimulus with a visual task. Furthermore, it was found that the magnitude of attentional modulation in secondary hyperalgesia is very similar to that of capsaicin-untreated, control condition. Our findings, showing no interaction between capsaicin treatment and attentional modulation suggest that capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia and attention might affect mechanical pain through independent mechanisms.

Peripheral neuropathy has been noted as a complication of therapy with perhexiline maleate, a drug widely used in France (and in clinical trials in the United States) for the prophylactic treatment of angina pectoris. In 24 patients with this complication, the marked slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity and the electromyographic changes imply mainly a demyelinating disorder. Improvement was noted with cessation of therapy. In a few cases the presence of active denervation signified a poor prognosis, with only slight improvement. The underlying mechanism causing the neuropathy is not yet fully known, although some evidence indicates that it may be a lipid storage process.

Peroxisomes are components of virtually all eukaryotic cells. While much is known about peroxisomal matrix protein import, our understanding of how peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) are targeted and inserted into the peroxisome membrane is extremely limited. Here, we show that PEX19 binds a broad spectrum of PMPs, displays saturable PMP binding, and interacts with regions of PMPs required for their targeting to peroxisomes. Furthermore, mislocalization of PEX19 to the nucleus leads to nuclear accumulation of newly synthesized PMPs. At steady state, PEX19 is bimodally distributed between the cytoplasm and peroxisome, with most of the protein in the cytoplasm. We propose that PEX19 may bind newly synthesized PMPs and facilitate their insertion into the peroxisome membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the loss of PEX19 results in degradation of PMPs and/or mislocalization of PMPs to the mitochondrion.
Peroxisomes in hepatomas and hyperplastic preneoplastic liver lesions induced in mice by 500 ppm alpha-benzene hexachloride were examined histochemically and electron microscopically. Although most of the hepatomas were well-differentiated tumors and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes, the tumor cells did not respond to ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate with proliferation of peroxisomes. At the 16th week of carcinogen feeding, hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages. A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes. Within the nodules, foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared. These cells proliferated further, replacing the most part of the nodules, and with this process hepatomas appeared to have been formed. No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate unlike in the case of rats.

Pethidine is an opioid that gains its popularity for the effective pain control through acting on the opioid-receptors. However, rapid pain relief sometimes brings about unfavourable side effects that largely limit its clinical utility. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting and hypotension. In patients with impaired renal and liver function, and those who need long-term pain control, pethidine may cause excitatory central nervous system (CNS) effects through its neurotoxic metabolite, norpethidine, resulting in irritability and seizure attack. On the contrary, though not clinically apparent, pethidine potentially causes inhibitory impacts on the CNS and impairs normal cerebellar and oculomotor function in the short term. In this case report, we highlight opioid's inhibitory side effects on the cerebellar structure that causes dysmetria, dysarthria, reduced smooth pursuit gain and decreased saccadic velocity.

Phenobarbital (PB) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that PB-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease. Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of epilepsy treated with PB who died suddenly: one as consequence of cardiac arrest, the other of acute bronchopneumonia. At autopsy, analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate, which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells, associated with several foci of necrosis surrounded by a hard ring of non-specific granulomatous tissue. Inflammatory reactions of internal and external hepatic biliary ducts were also seen. Our findings illustrate that PB may be associated with chronic liver damage, which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences. For this reason, each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of PB-related asymptomatic chronic hepatic enzyme dysfunction.

Phenotypic characteristics expressed in syndromes give clues to the factors involved in the cause of isolated forms of the same defects. We investigated two genes responsible for craniofacial syndromes, FGFR1 and IRF6, in a collection of families with isolated tooth agenesis. Cheek swab samples were obtained for DNA analysis from 116 case/parent trios. Probands had at least one developmentally missing tooth, excluding third molars. In addition, we studied 89 cases and 50 controls from Ohio to replicate any positive findings. Genotyping was performed by kinetic polymerase chain-reaction or TaqMan assays. Linkage disequilibrium analysis and transmission distortion of the marker alleles were performed. The same variants in the IRF6 gene that are associated with isolated orofacial clefts are also associated with human tooth agenesis (rs861019, P = 0.058; rs17015215-V274I, P = 0.0006; rs7802, P = 0.004). Mutations in IRF6 cause Van der Woude and popliteal pterygium syndromes. The craniofacial phenotypic characteristics of these syndromes include oral clefts and preferential tooth agenesis of incisors and premolars, besides pits on the lower lips. Also it appears that preferential premolar agenesis is associated with FGFR1 (P = 0.014) and IRF6 (P = 0.002) markers. There were statistically significant data suggesting that IRF6 interacts not only with MSX1 (P = 0.001), but also with TGFA (P = 0.03).

Phenylephrine but not ephedrine reduces frontal lobe oxygenation following anesthesia-induced hypotension.
Phenylketonuria (PKU) and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Previous studies have suggested that the highly variable metabolic phenotypes of PAH deficiency correlate with PAH genotypes. We identified both causative mutations in 686 patients from seven European centers. On the basis of the phenotypic characteristics of 297 functionally hemizygous patients, 105 of the mutations were assigned to one of four arbitrary phenotype categories. We proposed and tested a simple model for correlation between genotype and phenotypic outcome. The observed phenotype matched the predicted phenotype in 79% of the cases, and in only 5 of 184 patients was the observed phenotype more than one category away from that expected. Among the seven contributing centers, the proportion of patients for whom the observed phenotype did not match the predicted phenotype was 4% -23% (P <. 0001), suggesting that differences in methods used for mutation detection or phenotype classification may account for a considerable proportion of genotype-phenotype inconsistencies. Our data indicate that the PAH-mutation genotype is the main determinant of metabolic phenotype in most patients with PAH deficiency. In the present study, the classification of 105 PAH mutations may allow the prediction of the biochemical phenotype in > 10, 000 genotypes, which may be useful for the management of hyperphenylalaninemia in newborns.
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder secondary to a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Several mutations in the PAH gene have recently been reported, and linkage disequilibrium was observed between RFLP haplotypes and specific mutations. A new molecular lesion has been identified in exon 7 of the PAH gene in a Hungarian PKU patient by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA. The C-to-T transition causes the substitution of Arg243 to a termination codon, and the mutant allele is associated with haplotype 4 of the PAH gene. The mutation is present in two of nine mutant haplotype 4 alleles among Eastern Europeans and is not present among Western Europeans and Asians. The rarity of this mutant allele and its restricted geographic distribution suggest that the mutational event occurred recently on a normal haplotype 4 background in Eastern Europe..
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disease caused by recessive mutations of the gene encoding the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The incidence of PKU varies widely across different geographic areas, and is highest (about 1 in 5, 000 live births) in Ireland and western Scotland, and among Yemenite Jews. A limited number of point mutations account for most of the PKU cases in the European population. Here we report that a single molecular defect--a deletion spanning the third exon of the PAH gene--is responsible for all the PKU cases among the Yemenite Jews. Examination of a random sample of Yemenite Jews using a molecular probe that detects the carriers of this deletion indicated a high frequency of the defective gene in this community. Although the deleted PAH gene was traced to 25 different locations throughout Yemen, family histories and official documents of the Yemenite Jewish community showed that the common ancestor of all the carriers of this genetic defect lived in Sana, the capital of Yemen, before the eighteenth century..
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disease due to deficiency of a hepatic enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The absence of PAH activity results in typical PKU while persistence of a residual enzyme activity gives rise to variant forms of the disease. We report here a 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the PAH gene (delta 194) in a mild variant, with markedly reduced affinity of the enzyme for phenylalanine (Km = 160 nM), and we provide functional evidence for responsibility of the deletion in the mutant phenotype. Since the deletion was located in the third exon of the gene, which presents no homology with other hydroxylases, we suggest that exon 3 is involved in the specificity of the enzyme for phenylalanine. Finally, since none of the 98 PKU patients tested were found to carry this particular deletion, our study suggests that this molecular event probably occurred recently on the background of a haplotype 2 gene in Portugal..
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder of amino acid metabolism caused by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH; phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, EC 1. 14. 16. 1). A cDNA clone for human PAH has previously been used to assign the corresponding gene to human chromosome 12. To define the regional map position of the disease locus and the PAH gene on human chromosome 12, DNA was isolated from human-hamster somatic cell hybrids with various deletions of human chromosome 12 and was analyzed by Southern blot analysis using the human cDNA PAH clone as a hybridization probe. From these results, together with detailed biochemical and cytogenetic characterization of the hybrid cells, the region on chromosome 12 containing the human PAH gene has been defined as 12q14. 3----qter 3----qter. The PAH map position on chromosome 12 was further localized by in situ hybridization of 125I-labeled human PAH cDNA to chromosomes prepared from a human lymphoblastoid cell line. Results of these experiments demonstrated that the region on chromosome 12 containing the PAH gene and the PKU locus in man is 12q22----12q24. 1. These results not only provide a regionalized map position for a major human disease locus but also can serve as a reference point for linkage analysis with other DNA markers on human chromosome 12
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, EC 1. 14. 16. 1). PKU is a common inborn error of amino-acid metabolism in caucasian populations and approximately 1 in 50 individuals are carriers of a PKU allele. To define the molecular basis of PKU, we characterized twelve restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes of the PAH locus in the northern European population and observed that 90% of the PKU alleles in this population are confined to four common RFLP haplotypes. We have recently reported a splicing mutation in the PAH gene that is associated with RFLP haplotype 3 which is present at about 40% of mutant alleles. We now report the molecular lesion associated with the RFLP haplotype 2 mutant allele. This defect is caused by a C-to-T transition in exon 12 resulting in an amino-acid substitution (Arg to Trp) at residue 408 of PAH. Direct hybridization analysis of the point mutation using a specific oligonucleotide probe demonstrated that this mutation is also in linkage disequilibrium with RFLP haplotype 2 alleles that make up about 20% of mutant PAH genes
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by a genetic deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). A full-length complementary DNA clone of human PAH was inserted into a eukaryotic expression vector and transferred into mouse NIH3T3 cells which do not normally express PAH. The transformed mouse cells expressed PAH messenger RNA, immunoreactive protein, and enzymatic activity that are characteristic of the normal human liver products, demonstrating that a single gene contains all of the necessary genetic information to code for functional PAH. These results support the use of the human PAH probe in prenatal diagnosis and detection of carriers, to provide new opportunities for the biochemical characterization of normal and mutant enzymes, and in the investigation of alternative genetic therapies for PKU..
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). A full-length human PAH cDNA sequence has been inserted into pzip-neoSV (X), which is a retroviral vector containing the bacterial neo gene. The recombinant has been transfected into psi 2 cells, which provide synthesis of the retroviral capsid. Recombinant virus was detected in the culture medium of the transfected psi 2 cells, which is capable of transmitting the human PAH gene into mouse NIH 3T3 cells by infection leading to stable incorporation of the recombinant provirus. Infected cells express PAH mRNA, immunoreactive PAH protein, and exhibit pterin-dependent phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. The recombinant virus is also capable of infecting a mouse hepatoma cell line that does not normally synthesize PAH. PAH activity is present in the cellular extracts and the entire hydroxylation system is reconstituted in the hepatoma cells infected with the recombinant viruses. Thus, recombinant viruses containing human PAH cDNA provide a means for introducing functional PAH into mammalian cells of hepatic origin and can potentially be introduced into whole animals as a model for somatic gene therapy for PKU..
Phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder of amino acid metabolism prevalent among Caucasians and other ethnic groups, is caused primarily by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PKU is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with more than 60 molecular lesions identified in the PAH gene. The haplotype associations, relative frequencies, and distributions of five prevalent PAH mutations (R158Q, R261Q, IVS10nt546, R408W, and IVS12n1) were established in a comprehensive European sample population and subsequently were examined to determine the potential roles of several genetic mechanisms in explaining the present distribution of the major PKU alleles. Each of these five mutations was strongly associated with only one of the more than 70 chromosomal haplotypes defined by eight RFLPs in or near the PAH gene. These findings suggest that each of these mutations arose through a single founding event that occurred within time periods ranging from several hundred to several thousand years ago. From the significant differences observed in the relative frequencies and distributions of these five alleles throughout Europe, four of these putative founding events could be localized to specific ethnic subgroups. Together, these data suggest that there were multiple, geographically and ethnically distinct origins for PKU within the European population..
Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including stroke. It is often combined with caffeine in diet preparations and "look-alike" pills. In order to determine if PPA/caffeine can lead to stroke in normotensive and/or hypertensive rats, we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days. Subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage was noted in 18% of the hypertensive rats. A single PPA/caffeine administration (same dose) lead to acute hypertension in both the normotensive and hypertensive animals. These results suggest that PPA/caffeine can lead to cerebral hemorrhage in previously hypertensive animals when administered in greater than the allowed dosage. An acute elevation in blood pressure may be a contributing factor.
Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) is a sympathetic amine used in over-the-counter cold remedies and weight-control preparations worldwide. Its use has been associated with hypertensive episodes and hemorrhagic strokes in younger women. Several reports have linked the abuse of PPA with myocardial injury, especially when overdose is involved. We report here the first case of Dexatrim (PPA)-induced myocardial injury in a young woman who was using it at recommended doses for weight control. In addition, we review the 7 other cases of PPA related myocardial injury that have been reported so far. Physicians and patients should be alert to the potential cardiac risk associated with the use of PPA, even at doses generally considered to be safe.
Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) overdose can cause severe hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, and death. We studied the efficacy and safety of propranolol in the treatment of PPA-induced hypertension. Subjects received propranolol either by mouth for 48 hours before PPA or as a rapid intravenous infusion after PPA. PPA, 75 mg alone, increased blood pressure (31 +/- 14 mm Hg systolic, 20 +/- 5 mm Hg diastolic), and propranolol pretreatment antagonized this increase (12 +/- 10 mm Hg systolic, 10 +/- 7 mm Hg diastolic). Intravenous propranolol after PPA also decreased blood pressure. Left ventricular function (assessed by echocardiography) showed that PPA increased the stroke volume 30% (from 62.5 +/- 20.9 to 80.8 +/- 22.4 ml), the ejection fraction 9% (from 64% +/- 10% to 70% +/- 7%), and cardiac output 14% (from 3.6 +/- 0.6 to 4.1 +/- 1.0 L/min). Intravenous propranolol reversed these effects. Systemic vascular resistance was increased by PPA 28% (from 1710 +/- 200 to 2190 +/- 700 dyne X sec/cm5) and was further increased by propranolol 22% (to 2660 +/- 1200 dyne X sec/cm5). We conclude that PPA increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, and that propranolol antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of PPA on cardiac output. That propranolol antagonizes the pressor effect of PPA is in contrast to the interaction in which propranolol enhances the pressor effect of norepinephrine. This is probably because PPA has less beta 2 activity than does norepinephrine.
Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), a synthetic sympathomimetic that is structurally similar to amphetamine, is available over the counter in anorectics, nasal congestants, and cold preparations. Its prolonged use or overuse has been associated with seizures, intracerebral hemorrhage, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction. We report the case of a young woman who suffered a cerebral infarction after taking a single oral dose of PPA.

Phosphoinositide-3 kinase activity is implicated in diverse cellular responses triggered by mammalian cell surface receptors and in the regulation of protein sorting in yeast. Receptors with intrinsic and associated tyrosine kinase activity recruit heterodimeric phosphoinositide-3 kinases that consist of p110 catalytic subunits and p85 adaptor molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. A phosphoinositide-3 kinase isotype, p110 gamma, was cloned and characterized. The p110 gamma enzyme was activated in vitro by both the alpha and beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G proteins) and did not interact with p85. A potential pleckstrin homology domain is located near its amino terminus. The p110 gamma isotype may link signaling through G protein-coupled receptors to the generation of phosphoinositide second messengers phosphorylated in the D-3 position.

Piebaldism is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by cogenital patches of skin and hair from which melanocytes are completely absent. A similar disorder of mouse, dominant white spotting (W), results from mutations of the c-Kit protooncogene, which encodes and receptor for mast/stem cell growth factor. We identified a KIT gene mutation in a proband with classic autosomal dominant piebaldism. This mutation results in a Gly----Arg substitution at codon 664, within the tyrosine kinase domain. This substitution was not seen in any normal individuals and was completely linked to the piebald phenotype in the probands family. Piebaldism in this family thus appears to be the human homologue to dominant white spotting (W) of the mouse..
Piebaldism with deafness: molecular evidence for an expanded syndrome.
Pilocarpine seizures cause age-dependent impairment in auditory location discrimination.
Pilocarpine, given intraperitoneally to rats, reproduces the neuropathological sequelae of temporal lobe epilepsy and provides a relevant animal model for studying mechanisms of buildup of convulsive activity and pathways operative in the generalization and propagation of seizures within the forebrain. In the present study, the effects of manipulating the activity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra on seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats, were investigated. In animals pretreated with microinjections of isoniazid, 150 micrograms, an inhibitor of activity of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme, L-glutamic acid decarboxylase, into the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR), bilaterally, non-convulsant doses of pilocarpine, 100 and 200 mg/kg, resulted in severe motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus. Electroencephalographic and behavioral monitoring revealed a profound reduction of the threshold for pilocarpine-induced convulsions. Morphological analysis of frontal forebrain sections with light microscopy revealed seizure-related damage to the hippocampal formation, thalamus, amygdala, olfactory cortex, substantia nigra and neocortex, which is typically observed with pilocarpine in doses exceeding 350 mg/kg. Bilateral intrastriatal injections of isoniazid did not augment seizures produced by pilocarpine, 200 mg/kg. Application of an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase, gamma-vinyl-GABA (D,L-4-amino-hex-5-enoic acid), 5 micrograms, into the SNR, bilaterally, suppressed the appearance of electrographic and behavioral seizures produced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. This treatment was also sufficient to protect animals from the occurrence of brain damage. Microinjections of gamma-vinyl-GABA, 5 micrograms, into the dorsal striatum, bilaterally, failed to prevent the development of convulsions produced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. The results demonstrate that the threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats is subjected to the regulation of the GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra.

Pituitary response to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone during haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia.
Pituitary tumors were induced in F344 female rats by chronic treatment with diethylstilbestrol (DES, 8-10 mg) implanted subcutaneously in silastic capsules. Over a range of 1-150 days of DES treatment, pairs of control and DES-treated rats were sacrificed, and their pituitaries dissociated enzymatically into single-cell preparations. The cell populations were examined regarding total cell recovery correlated with gland weight, intracellular prolactin (PRL) content and subsequent release in primary culture, immunocytochemical PRL staining, density and/or size alterations via separation on Ficoll-Hypaque and by unit gravity sedimentation, and cell cycle analysis, after acriflavine DNA staining, by laser flow cytometry. Total cell yields from DES-treated pituitaries increased from 1.3 times control yields at 8 days of treatment to 58.9 times control values by day 150. Intracellular PRL content ranged from 1.9 to 9.4 times control levels, and PRL release in vitro was significantly and consistently higher than controls, after at least 8 days of DES exposure. Beyond 8 days of DES exposure, the immunochemically PRL-positive proportion of cells increased to over 50% of the total population. Increased density and/or size and PRL content were indicated for the majority of the PRL cell population in both types of separation protocols. All these effects of DES were more pronounced among previously ovariectomized animals. The data extend the findings of other investigators, further establishing the DES-induced tumor as a model for study of PRL cellular control mechanisms.
Placebo-level incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) with quetiapine in controlled studies of patients with bipolar mania.
Plasma HDL are a negative risk factor for atherosclerosis. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP; 476 amino acids) transfers cholesteryl ester from HDL to other lipoproteins. Subjects with homozygous CETP deficiency caused by a gene splicing defect have markedly elevated HDL; however, heterozygotes have only mild increases in HDL. We describe two probands with a CETP missense mutation (442 D G). Although heterozygous, they have threefold increases in HDL concentration and markedly decreased plasma CETP mass and activity, suggesting that the mutation has dominant effects on CETP and HDL in vivo. Cellular expression of mutant cDNA results in secretion of only 30% of wild type CETP activity. Moreover, coexpression of wild type and mutant cDNAs leads to inhibition of wild type secretion and activity. The dominant effects of the CETP missense mutation during cellular expression probably explains why the probands have markedly increased HDL in the heterozygous state, and suggests that the active molecular species of CETP may be multimeric..
Plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of nephrotic syndrome induced in the rat by puromycin aminonucleoside.
Plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin-angiotensin system proteins are altered in rats with nephrotic syndrome (NS). In this work the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of angiotensinogen (Ao) were analyzed with the slot-blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues: kidney, heart, brain, and adrenal gland from control, nephrotic, and pair-fed (PF) rats. NS was induced by a single injection of puromycin amino-nucleoside (PAN). Although a great urinary excretion and half-normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after PAN injection, when NS was clearly established, hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change. Furthermore, the Ao mRNA levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6, nor did its hepatic levels at days 1, 3, 5, or 7 after PAN injection. These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute NS induced by PAN.
Plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are strongly genetically determined and show a general inverse relationship with coronary heart disease (CHD). The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to other lipoproteins and is a key participant in the reverse transport of cholesterol from the periphery to the liver. A high prevalence of two different CETP gene mutations (D442G, 5. 1%; intron 14G A, 0. 5%), was found in 3, 469 men of Japanese ancestry in the Honolulu Heart Program and mutations were associated with decreased CETP (-35%) and increased HDL chol levels (+ 10% for D442G). However, the overall prevalence of definite CHD was 21% in men with mutations and 16% in men without mutations. The relative risk (RR) of CHD was 1. 43 in men with mutations (P <. 05); after adjustment for CHD risk factors, the RR was 1. 55 (P =. 02); after additional adjustment for HDL levels, the RR was 1. 68 (P =. 008). Similar RR values were obtained for the D442G mutation alone. Increased CHD in men with mutations was primarily observed for HDL chol 41-60 mg/dl; for HDL chol > 60 mg/dl men with and without mutations had low CHD prevalence. Thus, genetic CETP deficiency appears to be an independent risk factor for CHD, primarily due to increased CHD prevalence in men with the D442G mutation and HDL cholesterol between 41 and 60 mg/dl. The findings suggest that both HDL concentration and the dynamics of cholesterol transport through HDL (i. e., reverse cholesterol transport) determine the anti-atherogenicity of the HDL fraction.
Platelet function is impaired by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with prominent anti-inflammatory properties. Their safety in patients undergoing intracranial surgery is under debate. Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were randomized to receive either ketoprofen, 100 mg, three times a day (ketoprofen group, n = 9) or a weak NSAID, acetaminophen, 1 g, three times a day (acetaminophen group, n = 9) starting immediately after the diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH. Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively. Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first, third, and fifth postoperative mornings. Maximal platelet aggregation induced by 6 microM of adenosine diphosphate decreased after administration of ketoprofen. Aggregation was lower (P < .05) in the ketoprofen group than in the acetaminophen group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day. In contrast, maximal platelet aggregation increased in the acetaminophen group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment platelet aggregation results (P < .05). One patient in the ketoprofen group developed a postoperative intracranial hematoma. Coagulation (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [APPT], fibrinogen concentration, and antithrombin III [AT III]) was comparable between the two groups. Ketoprofen but not acetaminophen impaired platelet function in patients with SAH. If ketoprofen is used before surgery on cerebral artery aneurysms, it may pose an additional risk factor for hemorrhage.
Platelets have a crucial role in the maintenance of normal haemostasis, and perturbations of this system can lead to pathological thrombus formation and vascular occlusion, resulting in stroke, myocardial infarction and unstable angina. ADP released from damaged vessels and red blood cells induces platelet aggregation through activation of the integrin GPIIb-IIIa and subsequent binding of fibrinogen. ADP is also secreted from platelets on activation, providing positive feedback that potentiates the actions of many platelet activators. ADP mediates platelet aggregation through its action on two G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes. The P2Y1 receptor couples to Gq and mobilizes intracellular calcium ions to mediate platelet shape change and aggregation. The second ADP receptor required for aggregation (variously called P2Y(ADP), P2Y(AC), P2Ycyc or P2T(AC)) is coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase through Gi. The molecular identity of the Gi-linked receptor is still elusive, even though it is the target of efficacious antithrombotic agents, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel and AR-C66096 (ref. 9). Here we describe the cloning of this receptor, designated P2Y12, and provide evidence that a patient with a bleeding disorder has a defect in this gene. Cloning of the P2Y12 receptor should facilitate the development of better antiplatelet agents to treat cardiovascular diseases.
Pleiotropic defects in ataxia-telangiectasia protein-deficient mice.
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals, is generally treated with high doses of co-trimoxazole. However, treatment is often limited by adverse effects. Here, we report two cases of severely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients who developed severe intrahepatic cholestasis, and in one patient lesions mimicking liver abscess formation on radiologic exams, during co-trimoxazole treatment for PCP. Whereas patient 1 showed lesions of up to 1 cm readily detectable on magnetic resonance imaging under prolonged co-trimoxazole treatment, therapy of patient 2 was switched early.
Pneumonitis with pleural and pericardial effusion and neuropathy during amiodarone therapy.
Pneumonitis, bilateral pleural effusions, echocardiographic evidence of cardiac tamponade, and positive autoantibodies developed in a 43-year-old man, who was receiving long-term sulfasalazine therapy for chronic ulcerative colitis. After cessation of the sulfasalazine and completion of a six-week course of corticosteroids, these problems resolved over a period of four to six months. It is suggested that the patient had sulfasalazine-induced lupus, which manifested with serositis and pulmonary parenchymal involvement in the absence of joint symptoms. Physicians who use sulfasalazine to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease should be aware of the signs of sulfasalazine-induced lupus syndrome.
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 cleavage during apoptosis: an update.
Poly(ADP-ribosylation) is a post-translational modification of proteins playing a crucial role in many processes, including DNA repair and cell death. The best known poly(ADP-ribosylating) enzyme, PARP-1, is a DNA nick sensor and uses betaNAD(+) to form polymers of ADP-ribose which are further bound to nuclear protein acceptors. To strictly regulate poly(ADP-ribose) turnover, its degradation is assured by the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). During apoptosis, PARP-1 plays two opposite roles: its stimulation leads to poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis, whereas caspases cause PARP-1 cleavage and inactivation. PARP-1 proteolysis produces an 89 kDa C-terminal fragment, with a reduced catalytic activity, and a 24 kDa N-terminal peptide, which retains the DNA binding domains. The fate and the possible role of these fragments during apoptosis will be discussed.

Positional cloning experiments have resulted recently in the isolation of a candidate gene for Norrie disease (pseudoglioma; NDP), a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder. Here we report the isolation and analysis of human genomic DNA clones encompassing the NDP gene. The gene spans 28 kb and consists of 3 exons, the first of which is entirely contained within the 5 untranslated region. Detailed analysis of genomic deletions in Norrie patients shows that they are heterogeneous, both in size and in position. By PCR analysis, we found that expression of the NDP gene was not confined to the eye or to the brain. An extensive DNA and protein sequence comparison between the human NDP gene and related genes from the database revealed homology with cysteine-rich protein-binding domains of immediate--early genes implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation. We propose that NDP is a molecule related in function to these genes and may be involved in a pathway that regulates neural cell differentiation and proliferation..

Posttransplant anemia is a common problem that may hinder patients' quality of life. It occurs in 12 to 76% of patients, and is most common in the immediate posttransplant period. A variety of factors have been identified that increase the risk of posttransplant anemia, of which the level of renal function is most important. Sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, has been implicated as playing a special role in posttransplant anemia. This review considers anemia associated with sirolimus, including its presentation, mechanisms, and management.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are distinct neurobehavioral disorders that most often arise from a 4-Mb deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 during paternal or maternal gametogenesis, respectively. At a de novo frequency of approximately. 67-1/10, 000 births, these deletions represent a common structural chromosome change in the human genome. To elucidate the mechanism underlying these events, we characterized the regions that contain two proximal breakpoint clusters and a distal cluster. Novel DNA sequences potentially associated with the breakpoints were positionally cloned from YACs within or near these regions. Analyses of rodent-human somatic-cell hybrids, YAC contigs, and FISH of normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences (the END repeats) at or near the breakpoints. The END-repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a novel gene (HERC2), many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germline tissues. One of five PWS/AS patients analyzed to date has an identifiable, rearranged HERC2 transcript derived from the deletion event. We postulate that the END repeats flanking 15q11-q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting in deletion. Furthermore, we propose that active transcription of these repeats in male and female germ cells may facilitate the homologous recombination process.
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) result from the loss of function of imprinted genes in human chromosome 15q11-q13. The central part of mouse chromosome 7 is homologous to human 15q11-q13, with conservation of both gene order and imprinted features. We report here the characterization of a transgene insertion (Epstein-Barr virus Latent Membrane Protein 2A, LMP2A) into mouse chromosome 7C, which has resulted in mouse models for PWS and AS dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent. Epigenotype (allelic expression and DNA methylation) and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses indicate that the transgene-induced mutation has generated a complete deletion of the PWS/AS-homologous region but has not deleted flanking loci. Because the intact chromosome 7, opposite the deleted homolog, maintains the correct imprint in somatic cells of PWS and AS mice and establishes the correct imprint in male and female germ cells of AS mice, homologous association and replication asynchrony are not part of the imprinting mechanism. This heritable-deletion mouse model will be particularly useful for the identification of the etiological genes and mechanisms, phenotypic basis, and investigation of therapeutic approaches for PWS..
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex neurogenetic disorder. The phenotype is likely to be a contiguous gene syndrome involving genes which are paternally expressed only, located in the human 15q11-q13 region. Four mouse models of PWS have been reported but these do not definitively allow the delineation of the critical region and the associated genes involved in the aetiology of PWS. Moreover, targeted mutagenesis of mouse homologues of the human candidate PWS genes does not appear to result in any of the features of PWS. Therefore, the isolation of new genes in this region remains crucial for a better understanding of the molecular basis of PWS. In this manuscript, we report the characterization of MAGEL2 and its mouse homologue Magel2. These are located in the human 15q11-q13 and mouse 7C regions, in close proximity to NDN/Ndn. By northern blot analysis we did not detect any expression of MAGEL2/Magel2 but by RT-PCR analysis, specific expression was detected in fetal and adult brain and in placenta. Both genes are intronless with tandem direct repeat sequences contained within a CpG island in the 5-untranscribed region. The transcripts encode putative proteins that are homologous to the MAGE proteins and NDN. Moreover, MAGEL2/Magel2 are expressed only from the paternal allele in brain, suggesting a potential role in the aetiology of PWS and its mouse model, respectively..
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurogenetic disease characterized by infantile hypotonia, gonadal hypoplasia, obsessive behaviour and neonatal feeding difficulties followed by hyperphagia, leading to profound obesity. PWS is due to a lack of paternal genetic information at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). Five imprinted, paternally expressed genes map to the PWS region, MKRN3 (ref. 3), NDN (ref. 4), NDNL1 (ref. 5), SNRPN (refs 6-8) and IPW (ref. 9), as well as two poorly characterized framents designated PAR-1 and PAR-5 (ref. 10). Imprinting of this region involves a bipartite imprinting centre (IC), which overlaps SNRPN (refs 10, 11). Deletion of the SNRPN promoter/exon 1 region (the PWS IC element) appears to impair the establishment of the paternal imprint in the male germ line and leads to PWS. Here we report a PWS family in which the father is mosaic for an IC deletion on his paternal chromosome. The deletion chromosome has acquired a maternal methylation imprint in his somatic cells. We have made identical findings in chimaeric mice generated from two independent embryonic stem (ES) cell lines harbouring a similar deletion. Our studies demonstrate that the PWS IC element is not only required for the establishment of the paternal imprint, but also for its postzygotic maintenance..
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is associated with paternally derived chromosomal deletions in region 15q11-13 or with maternal disomy for chromosome 15. Therefore, loss of the expressed paternal alleles of maternally imprinted genes must be responsible for the PWS phenotype. We have mapped the gene encoding the small nuclear RNA associated polypeptide SmN (SNRPN) to human chromosome 15q12 and a processed pseudogene SNRPNP1 to chromosome region 6pter-p21. Furthermore, SNRPN was mapped to the minimal deletion interval that is critical for PWS. The fact that the mouse Snrpn gene is maternally imprinted in brain suggests that loss of the paternally derived SNRPN allele may be involved in the PWS phenotype..
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the loss of expression of imprinted genes in chromosome 15q11-q13. Affected individuals exhibit neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay and childhood-onset obesity. Necdin, a protein implicated in the terminal differentiation of neurons, is the only PWS candidate gene to reduce viability when disrupted in a mouse model. In this study, we have characterized MAGEL2 (also known as NDNL1), a gene with 51% amino acid sequence similarity to necdin and located 41 kb distal to NDN in the PWS deletion region. MAGEL2 is expressed predominantly in brain, the primary tissue affected in PWS and in several fetal tissues as shown by northern blot analysis. MAGEL2 is imprinted with monoallelic expression in control brain, and paternal-only expression in the central nervous system as demonstrated by its lack of expression in brain from a PWS-affected individual. The orthologous mouse gene (Magel2) is located within 150 kb of NDN , is imprinted with paternal-only expression and is expressed predominantly in late developmental stages and adult brain as shown by northern blotting, RT-PCR and whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization. Magel2 distribution partially overlaps that of NDN , with strong expression being detected in the central nervous system in mid-gestation mouse embryos by in situ hybridization. We hypothesize that, although loss of necdin expression may be important in the neonatal presentation of PWS, loss of MAGEL2 may be critical to abnormalities in brain development and dysmorphic features in individuals with PWS..

Pre-eclampsia is a principal cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, affecting 5-10% of first pregnancies worldwide. Manifestations include increased blood pressure, proteinuria, coagulopathy and peripheral and cerebral oedema. Although the aetiology and pathogenesis remain to be elucidated, the placenta is undoubtedly involved, as termination of pregnancy eradicates the disease. Here we have cloned a complementary DNA from human placental messenger RNA encoding a precursor protein of 121 amino acids which gives rise to a mature peptide identical to the neuropeptide neurokinin B (NKB) of other mammalian species. In female rats, concentrations of NKB several-fold above that of an animal 20 days into pregnancy caused substantial pressor activity. In human pregnancy, the expression of NKB was confined to the outer syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta, significant concentrations of NKB could be detected in plasma as early as week 9, and plasma concentrations of NKB were grossly elevated in pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. We conclude that elevated levels of NKB in early pregnancy may be an indicator of hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and that treatment with certain neurokinin receptor antagonists may be useful in alleviating the symptoms.

Precise estimates of mutation rates at Y-chromosomal microsatellite STR (short tandem repeat) loci make an important basis for paternity diagnostics and dating of Y chromosome lineage origins. There are indications of considerable locus mutation rate variability between (inter-) and within (intra-) loci. We have studied nine Y-STR loci-DYS19, DYS389I/II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS385, and DYS388-in 1,766 father-son pairs of confirmed paternity (a total of 15,894 meioses). Five biallelic markers were also analyzed in the fathers-Tat, YAP, 12f2, SRY1532, and 92R7-defining haplogroups 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, and 16, respectively. A total of 36 fragment length mutations were observed: 24 gains (22 single-step, two double-step) and 12 single-step losses. Thus, there was a significant surplus of gains (p=0.045). Overall, the mutation rate was positively correlated to STR repeat length and there was a significant relative excess of losses in long alleles and gains in short alleles (p=0.043). In contrast to the situation in autosomal STR loci and in MSY-1, no noteworthy correlation between mutation rate and the father's age at the child's birth was observed. We observed significant interlocus differences in Y-STR mutation rates (p<0.01). The number of observed mutations ranged from zero in DYS392 to eight in DYS391 and DYS390. We have also demonstrated obvious differences in mutation rates between the haplogroups studied (p=0.024), a phenomenon that is a reflection of the dependence of mutation rate on allele size. Our study has thus demonstrated the necessity of not only locus-specific, but even allele-specific, mutation rate estimates for forensic and population genetic purposes, and provides a considerable basis for such estimates.
Preclinical toxicologic investigation suggested that a new calcium channel blocker, Ro 40-5967, induced cardiovascular alterations in rat fetuses exposed to this agent during organogenesis. The present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that calcium channel blockers in general induce cardiovascular malformations indicating a pharmacologic class effect. We studied three calcium channel blockers of different structure, nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil, along with the new agent. Pregnant rats were administered one of these calcium channel blockers during the period of cardiac morphogenesis and the offspring examined on day 20 of gestation for cardiovascular malformations. A low incidence of cardiovascular malformations was observed after exposure to each of the four calcium channel blockers, but this incidence was statistically significant only for verapamil and nifedipine. All four agents were associated with aortic arch branching variants, although significantly increased only for Ro 40-5967 and verapamil.

Pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein (PS beta G), a major product of the placenta with unknown function, consists of a set of glycoproteins synthesized by the syncytiotrophoblast. We report here the molecular cloning of 3 cDNA encoding different members of the PS beta G family. Two clones (C, D) correspond to a single transcript undergoing differential splicing. The third one (E) originates from a different gene. All three clones have identical (C, D) or similar (E) coding sequences except for the last residues at their carboxyl end. They contain 93 residue motifs related to the ancestral Ig-like domain which makes them new members of this gene superfamily. A striking sequence similarity (50 to 60%) is observed between PS beta G and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related proteins. The evolutionary relationship between CEA and PS beta G points to a possible common function in the control of cell invasion and/or metastasis.
Pregnenolone sulphate (PREGS) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory-enhancing neurosteroids to be examined in rodent learning studies, with particular importance in the ageing process. The mechanism by which this endogenous steroid enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems. This hypothesis stems from findings that PREGS is a potent positive modulator of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and a negative modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). Moreover, PREGS is able to reverse the amnesic-like effects of NMDAR and GABA(A)R ligands. To investigate this hypothesis, the present study in rats examined the memory-altering abilities of structural analogs of PREGS, which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and/or GABA(A)R function. The analogs tested were: 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate (an agent that is inactive at GABA(A)Rs and NMDARs), epipregnanolone ([3beta-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one] sulphate, an inhibitor of both GABA(A)Rs and NMDARs), and a newly synthesized (-) PREGS enantiomer (which is identical to PREGS in effects on GABA(A)Rs and NMDARs). The memory-enhancing effects of PREGS and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine-induced amnesia. Both PREGS and its (-) enantiomer blocked the effects of scopolamine. The results show that, unlike PREGS, 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate and epipregnanolone sulphate failed to block the effect of scopolamine, suggesting that altering the modulation of NMDA receptors diminishes the memory-enhancing effects of PREGS. Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine-induced amnesia. These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive steroids.

Presenilin 1 (PS1) is mutated in the majority of familial cases of Alzheimer disease (AD). Although it is clear that PS1 is involved in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the exact function of PS1 is still elusive. Human presenilin 1 (PS1) is alternatively spliced, resulting in the presence or absence of a four-amino acid motif, VRSQ, in the PS1 N-terminus. In human tissues, both isoforms are expressed. Here we report that mouse and rat only express the longer PS1 isoform. The presence of this motif introduces a potential phosphorylation site for protein kinase C. Because the splice occurs in the region of PS1 that we have previously shown to bind to rabGDI, this might provide a regulatory mechanism for this interaction. Our data show that the -VRSQ isoform binds rabGDI, but the +VRSQ does not. Moreover, mutation of the putatively phosphorylated threonine in PS1 disrupts the binding to rabGDI, showing its importance for the interaction. To our knowledge this is the first study showing a functional difference between PS1 splice variants. The possible consequences for APP processing and the pathogenesis of AD are discussed.

Preservation of renal blood flow during hypotension induced with fenoldopam in dogs.
Pretreatment with ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) (6 mmol/kg s.c.) approximately doubled the time morphine-treated mice remained on a hot surface and similarly increased muscular incoordination by diazepam, but NH4Ac treatment alone had no effect. Thus, hyperammonemia is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with liver disease. Experiments in vitro showed that acetylcholine-induced catecholamine release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50% by 0.3 mM NH4Ac and KCl-induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum were inhibited 20% by 5 mM NH4Ac. Addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues, but calcium-independent catecholamine release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by NH4Ac. These results suggested that ammonia blocks calcium channels. Parallels in the actions of NH4Ac and the calcium channel blocker verapamil support this concept. Both verapamil (10 mg/kg i.p.) and NH4Ac pretreatment enhanced morphine analgesia- and diazepam-induced muscular incoordination and antagonized amphetamine-induced motor activity, and neither verapamil nor NH4Ac affected the convulsant action of metrazol. The data suggest that hyperammonemia exerts a calcium channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics.

Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a hypotensive response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord. The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla, coinciding with the raphe magnus. In spontaneously hypertensive, stroke-prone rats, microinjection of methyldopa into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension of 30-40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2-3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) injected intracerebroventricularly. However, intraspinal injection of 5,7-DHT to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension. Further, 5,7-DHT lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells, did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 serotonin methyldopa injection. It is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a methyldopa-induced hypotension via descending projections, the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem.
Previous reports have suggested that pain associated with the injection of lidocaine is related to the acidic pH of the solution. To determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the pH of lidocaine into the physiologic range would reduce pain during injection, we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of pain after receiving standard lidocaine in one femoral area and buffered lidocaine in the opposite femoral area. The mean pain score for buffered lidocaine was significantly lower than the mean score for standard lidocaine (2.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 2.2, P = 0.03). The pH adjustment of standard lidocaine can be accomplished easily in the catheterization laboratory before injection and results in a reduction of the pain occurring during the infiltration of tissues.
Previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to drug dependency. The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine. After a 30-min baseline measure of locomotor activity (day 0), animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12-h deprivation followed by 12-h access to 10% sucrose solution and chow pellets (12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period) for 21 days. Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access. Beginning on day 22, all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow. Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection, cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection, ad libitum chow with amphetamine, or cyclic 10% sucrose and chow with a saline injection). These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine, possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system.
Previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat. Pre-treatment with ketamine produced cross-tolerance to morphine, whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross-tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain. The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, administered simultaneously. There was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, but sub-effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully-effective doses of morphine. Latency to the loss of righting reflex, rigidity and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combination. Naloxone inhibited the induced cataleptic effects. The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub-effective dose combinations of ketamine and morphine were similar. Rats, tolerant to ketamine-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to morphine-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to morphine but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to ketamine. While the mutual potentiation, antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced catalepsy, differences in latency, rigidity and behavior, asymmetry of cross-tolerance and a widely-different ID50 for naloxone would argue against an action at a single opioid site.
Previous studies evaluated the tolerance of nimesulide and paracetamol in subjects with cutaneous, respiratory and anaphylactoid reactions induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In this study we investigated tolerability and reliability of nimesulide and paracetamol in a very large number of patients with an exclusive well-documented history of NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema. Furthermore, we evaluated whether some factors have the potential to increase the risk of reaction to paracetamol and nimesulide. A single-placebo-controlled oral challenge procedure with nimesulide or paracetamol was applied to 829 patients with a history of NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema. A total of 75/829 (9.4%) patients experienced reactions to nimesulide or paracetamol. Of the 715 patients tested with nimesulide 62 (8.6%) showed a positive test, while of 114 subjects submitted to the challenge with paracetamol, 13 (9.6%) did not tolerate this drug. Furthermore, 18.28% of patients with a history of chronic urticaria and 11.8% of subjects with an history of NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema or angioedema alone (with or without chronic urticaria) resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs. Taken together, our results confirm the good tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients who experienced urticaria/angioedema caused by NSAIDs. However, the risk of reaction to these alternative study drugs is statistically increased by a history of chronic urticaria and, above all, by a history of NSAID-induced angioedema.
Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation. In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined. In addition, the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nicotine. Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats tested in photocell cages. Nicotine (1.0 mg/kg) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment, but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment. The stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium, indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors. Nicotine-induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390, the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1/D2 antagonist fluphenazine. Pretreatment with the D2 agonist PHNO enhanced nicotine-induced hyperactivity, whereas the D1 agonist SKF 38393 had no effect. The results indicate that acute nicotine injection induces a pronounced hyperactivity in rats habituated to the test environment. The effect appears to be mediated by central nicotine receptors, possibly located on dopaminergic neurons, and also requires the activation of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors.

A 45-year-old man, an admitted frequent cocaine user, presented to the Emergency Department (ED) on two separate occasions with a history of priapism after cocaine use.

Primary adhalinopathy: a common cause of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy of variable severity.
Primary dysmenorrhea is a syndrome characterized by painful uterine contractility caused by a hypersecretion of endometrial prostaglandins; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first choice for its treatment. However, in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that myometrial cells are also targets of the relaxant effects of nitric oxide (NO). The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), an NO donor, in the resolution of primary dysmenorrhea in comparison with diclofenac (DCF). A total of 24 patients with the diagnosis of severe primary dysmenorrhea were studied during two consecutive menstrual cycles. In an open, cross-over, controlled design, patients were randomized to receive either DCF per os or GTN patches the first days of menses, when menstrual cramps became unendurable. In the subsequent cycle the other treatment was used. Patients received up to 3 doses/day of 50 mg DCF or 2.5 mg/24 h transdermal GTN for the first 3 days of the cycle, according to their needs. The participants recorded menstrual symptoms and possible side-effects at different times (0, 30, 60, 120 minutes) after the first dose of medication on the first day of the cycle, with both drugs. The difference in pain intensity score (DPI) was the main outcome variable. Both treatments significantly reduced DPI by the 30th minute (GTN, -12.8 +/- 17.9; DCF, -18.9 +/- 16.6). However, DCF continued to be effective in reducing pelvic pain for two hours, whereas GTN scores remained more or less stable after 30 min and significantly higher than those for DFC (after one hour: GTN, -12.8 +/- 17.9; DFC, -18.9 +/- 16.6 and after two hours: GTN, -23.7 +/- 20.5; DFC, -59.7 +/- 17.9, p = 0.0001). Low back pain was also relieved by both drugs. Headache was significantly increased by GTN but not by DCF. Eight patients stopped using GTN because headache--attributed to its use--became intolerable. These findings indicate that GTN has a reduced efficacy and tolerability by comparison with DCF in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.
Primary dystonias are movement disorders with dystonia as a major symptom. They are frequently inherited as Mendelian traits. There are at least eight clinically distinct autosomal dominant and two X-linked recessive forms. In addition, pedigree analyses suggest the occurrence of an autosomal recessive variant. The clinical classification is increasingly being replaced by a genetic one. To date gene loci have been identified in at least six autosomal dominant forms, i. e., in idiopathic torsion dystonia (9q34), focal dystonia (18p), adult-onset idiopathic torsion dystonia of mixed type (8p21-q22), dopa-responsive dystonia (14q22. 1-q22. 2), and paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis (2q25-q33; 1p21-p13. 3). Gene loci in the X-linked recessive forms have been assigned to Xq13. 1 in the X-linked dystonia parkinsonism syndrome and to Xq22 in X-linked sensorineural deafness, dystonia, and mental retardation. The disease genes have been identified in two autosomal dominant forms and in one X-linked recessive form. Mutations in a gene coding for an ATP-binding protein were detected in idiopathic torsion dystonia (DYT1), and the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 gene is mutated in dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT5). In sensorineural deafness, dystonia, and mental retardation , mutations were found in the gene DDP coding for a polypeptide of unknown function. This article reviews the clinical and molecular genetics of primary dystonias, critically discusses present findings, and proposes referring to the known forms, most of which can be distinguished by genetic criteria, as dystonias 1-12.
Primary hyperoxaluria type II (PH2) is a rare monogenic disorder that is characterized by a lack of the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of hydroxypyruvate to D-glycerate, the reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate and the oxidation of D-glycerate to hydroxypyruvate. The disease is characterized by an elevated urinary excretion of oxalate and L-glycerate. The increased oxalate excretion can cause nephrolithiasis and nephrocalci-nosis and can, in some cases, result in renal failure and systemic oxalate deposition. We identified a glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) cDNA clone from a human liver expressed sequence tag (EST) library. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified a 1198 nucleotide clone that encoded a 984 nucleotide open reading frame. The open reading frame encodes a predicted 328 amino acid protein with a mass of 35 563 Da. Transient transfection of the cDNA clone into COS cells verified that it encoded an enzyme with hydroxy-pyruvate reductase, glyoxylate reductase and D-glycerate dehydrogenase enzymatic activities. Database analysis of human ESTs reveals widespread tissue expression, indicating that the enzyme may have a previously unrecognized role in metabolism. The genomic structure of the human GRHPR gene was determined and contains nine exons and eight introns and spans approximately 9 kb pericentromeric on chromosome 9. Four PH2 patients representing two pairs of siblings from two unrelated families were analyzed for mutations in GRHPR by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. All four patients were homozygous for a single nucleotide deletion at codon 35 in exon 2, resulting in a premature stop codon at codon 45. The cDNA that we have identified represents the first characterization of an animal GRHPR sequence. The data we present will facilitate future genetic testing to confirm the clinical diagnosis of PH2. These data will also facilitate heterozygote testing and prenatal testing in families affected with PH2 to aid in genetic counseling.
Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, progressive and incurable disease, which has been associated with the intake of appetite suppressant drugs. The importance of this association was evaluated in Belgium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of appetite suppressants. Thirty-five patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months (1992-1994) in Belgium. Exposure to appetite-suppressants was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview. Twenty-three of the patients had previously taken appetite suppressants, mainly fenfluramines, as compared with only 5 of the controls (66 versus 6%, p<0.0001). Five patients died before the interview, all of them had taken appetite suppressants. In 8 patients the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension was uncertain, 5 of them had taken appetite suppressants. The patients who had been exposed to appetite suppressants tended to be on average more severely ill, and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. A policy of unrestricted prescription of appetite suppressants may lead to a high incidence of associated primary pulmonary hypertension. Intake of appetite suppressants may accelerate the progression of the disease.

Procaterol and terbutaline in bronchial asthma. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study.
Procaterol, a new beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulant, was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in patients with bronchial asthma. Oral procaterol 50 micrograms b.d., procaterol 100 micrograms b.d., and terbutaline 5 mg t.i.d., were compared when given randomly in 1-week treatment periods. The best clinical effect was found with terbutaline. Both anti-asthmatic and tremorgenic effects of procaterol were dose-related. Procaterol appeared effective in the doses tested, and a twice daily regimen would appear to be suitable with this drug.
Production of autochthonous prostate cancer in Lobund-Wistar rats by treatments with N-nitroso-N-methylurea and testosterone.
Products of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) genes are essential for mammalian gonadogenesis prior to sexual differentiation. In males, SF-1 participates in sexual development by regulating expression of the polypeptide hormone Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS). Here, we show that WT1 -KTS isoforms associate and synergize with SF-1 to promote MIS expression. In contrast, WT1 missense mutations, associated with male pseudohermaphroditism in Denys-Drash syndrome, fail to synergize with SF-1. Additionally, the X-linked, candidate dosage-sensitive sex-reversal gene, Dax-1, antagonizes synergy between SF-1 and WT1, most likely through a direct interaction with SF-1. We propose that WT1 and Dax-1 functionally oppose each other in testis development by modulating SF-1-mediated transactivation..

Programmed cell death (or apoptosis) is a physiological process essential to the normal development and homeostatic maintenance of the immune system. The Fas/Apo-1 receptor plays a crucial role in the regulation of apoptosis, as demonstrated by lymphoproliferation in MRL-lpr/lpr mice and by the recently described autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) in humans, both of which are due to mutations in the Fas gene. We describe a novel family with ALPS in which three affected siblings carry two distinct missense mutations on both the Fas gene alleles and show lack of Fas-induced apoptosis. The children share common clinical features including splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, but only one developed severe autoimmune manifestations. In all three siblings, we demonstrated the presence of anergic CD3 + CD4-CD8- (double negative, [DN]) T cells; moreover, a chronic lymphocyte activation was found, as demonstrated by the presence of high levels of HLA-DR expression on peripheral CD3 + cells and by the presence of high levels of serum activation markers such as soluble interleukin-2 receptor (slL-2R) and soluble CD30 (sCD30)..

Proinflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms have been demonstrated to associate with gastric cancer risk, of which IL1B-31T/C and -511C/T changes have been well investigated due to the possibility that they may alter the IL1B transcription. The signal transduction target upon interleukin 1 beta (IL1beta) stimulation, the nuclear factor of kappa B (NFkappaB) activation, supports cancer development, signal transduction in which is mediated by FS-7 cell-associated cell surface antigen (FAS) signaling. Based on recent papers describing the prognostic roles of the polymorphisms and the NFkappaB functions on cancer development, we sought to determine if Japanese gastric cancer patients were affected by the IL1B -31/-511 and FAS-670 polymorphisms. A case-control study was conducted on incident gastric adenocarcinoma patients (n=271) and age-gender frequency-matched control subjects (n=271). We observed strong linkage disequilibrium between the T allele at -511 and the C allele at -31 and between the C allele at -511 and the T allele at -31 in IL1B in both the cases and controls (R (2)=0.94). Neither IL1B-31, -511 nor FAS-670 polymorphisms showed significantly different risks of gastric adenocarcinoma. Though FAS-670 polymorphisms did not show any significant difference, the proportion of subjects with IL1B-31TT (or IL1B-511CC) increased according to stage (trend P=0.019). In particular, subjects with stage IV had a two times higher probability of having either IL1B-31TT (or IL1B-511CC) genotype compared with stage I subjects. These observations suggest that IL1B-31TT and IL1B-511CC are associated with disease progression.

Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) are discrete interchromosomal macromolecular structures. The integrity of this dynamic nuclear subcompartment critically depends on the presence of the name-giving PML protein. Among the permanent or transient residents of PML-NBs are various regulatory proteins, including Sp100, CBP, pRb, HIPK2, RAD51 and p53. PML-NBs are frequently targeted by viral infections, as a number of different RNA and DNA viruses, including herpesviruses, adenoviruses, papovaviruses, papillomaviruses and arenaviruses, cause changes in PML-NBs. Viruses interfere with PML-NB in two ways: 1) some viral proteins can associate with PML-NB proteins and/or lead to the destruction and lysis of this subnuclear compartment, thus aiding viral gene expression and disabling the host's innate immunity; 2) the parental genomes of some nuclear-replicating DNA viruses associate preferentially with PML-NBs, which presumably serves to assist in viral gene expression or replication. Here we feature the different viral strategies leading to the hijacking of PML-NBs and discuss the consequences for the immune response.

Propranolol antagonism of phenylpropanolamine-induced hypertension.
Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, has found an important position in the practice of medicine. Its use in pregnancy, however, is an open question as a number of detrimental side effects have been reported in the fetus and neonate. Ten patients and 12 pregnancies are reported where chronic propranolol has been administered. Five patients with serial pregnancies with and without propranolol therapy are also examined. Maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications are examined. An attempt is made to differentiate drug-related complications from maternal disease--related complications. We conclude that previously reported hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, neonatal apnea, and bradycardia are not invariable and cannot be statistically correlated with chronic propranolol therapy. Growth retardation, however, appears to be significant in both of our series.
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is at a locus for autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia, and recent data indicate that the PCSK9 gene is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Mutations within this gene have previously been found to segregate with hypercholesterolemia. In this study, DNA sequencing of the 12 exons of the PCSK9 gene has been performed in 51 Norwegian subjects with a clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia where mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene and mutation R3500Q in the apolipoprotein B-100 gene had been excluded. Two novel missense mutations were detected in the catalytic subdomain of the PCSK9 gene. Two patients were heterozygotes for D374Y, and one patient was a double heterozygote for D374Y and N157K. D374Y segregated with hypercholesterolemia in the two former families where family members were available for study. Our findings support the notion that mutations in the PCSK9 gene cause autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia.

Prostate cancer clusters in some families, and an estimated 5% -10% of all cases are estimated to result from inheritance of prostate cancer-susceptibility genes. We previously reported evidence of linkage to the 1q24-25 region (HPC1) in 91 North American and Swedish families each with multiple cases of prostate cancer (Smith et al. 1996). In the present report we analyze 40 (12 original and 28 newly identified) Swedish families with hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) that, on the basis of 40 markers spanning a 25-cM interval within 1q24-25, have evidence of linkage. In the complete set of families, a maximum two-point LOD score of 1. 10 was observed at D1S413 (at a recombination fraction [theta] of. 1), with a maximum NPL (nonparametric linkage) Z score of 1. 64 at D1S202 (P =. 05). The evidence of linkage to this region originated almost exclusively from the subset of 12 early-onset (age < 65 years) families, which yielded a maximum LOD score of 2. 38 at D1S413 (straight theta = 0) and an NPL Z score of 1. 95 at D1S422 (P =. 03). Estimates from heterogeneity tests suggest that, within Sweden, as many as 50% of early-onset families had evidence of linkage to the HPC1 region. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of linkage to HPC1 in a subset of families with prostate cancer, particularly those with an early age at diagnosis.
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of male cancer deaths in the United States. Yet, despite a large international effort, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie this devastating disease. Prostate secretory epithelial cells and androgen-dependent prostate carcinomas undergo apoptosis in response to androgen deprivation and, furthermore, most prostate carcinomas become androgen independent and refractory to further therapeutic manipulations during disease progression. Definition of the genetic events that trigger apoptosis in the prostate could provide important insights into critical pathways in normal development as well as elucidate the perturbations of those key pathways in neoplastic transformation. We report the functional definition of a novel genetic locus within human chromosome 10pter-q11 that mediates both in vivo tumor suppression and in vitro apoptosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma cells. A defined fragment of human chromosome 10 was transferred via microcell fusion into a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line. Microcell hybrids containing only the region 10pter-q11 were suppressed for tumorigenicity following injection of microcell hybrids into nude mice. Furthermore, the complemented hybrids undergo programmed cell death in vitro via a mechanism that does not require nuclear localization of p53. These data functionally define a novel genetic locus, designated PAC1, for prostate adenocarcinoma 1, involved in tumor suppression of human prostate carcinoma and furthermore strongly suggest that the cell death pathway can be functionally restored in prostatic adenocarcinoma..
Prostatic tissue specimens derived from transurethral resections of patients with metastatic prostate cancer were analyzed for genetic alterations in the hormone-binding domain of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. Direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-derived DNAs of 6 of 24 specimens revealed a codon 877 mutation (ACT-- > GCT, Thr-- > Ala) in the hormone-binding domain of the AR gene. This same AR mutation has been reported previously in a metastatic prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, where this mutation confers upon the AR an altered ligand-binding specificity which is stimulated by estrogens, progestagens, and antiandrogens. It is possible that analogous to an activated/altered growth factor receptor oncogene, codon 877 mutant AR with altered ligand binding may provide a selective growth advantage in the genesis of a subset of advanced prostate cancer. Although estrogens are used infrequently, antiandrogens are used increasingly in hormonal therapy for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The stimulatory effect of these therapeutic agents on the codon 877 mutant AR further suggests that this frequently observed AR mutation may contribute to the treatment refractory disease..

Protein S deficiency is a recognized risk factor for venous thrombosis. Of all the inherited thrombophilic conditions, it remains the most difficult to diagnose because of phenotypic variability, which can lead to inconclusive results. We have overcome this problem by studying a cohort of patients from a single center where the diagnosis was confirmed at the genetic level. Twenty-eight index patients with protein S deficiency and a PROS1 gene defect were studied, together with 109 first-degree relatives. To avoid selection bias, we confined analysis of total and free protein S levels and thrombotic risk to the patients relatives. In this group of relatives, a low free protein S level was the most reliable predictor of a PROS1 gene defect (sensitivity 97. 7%, specificity 100%). First-degree relatives with a PROS1 gene defect had a 5. 0-fold higher risk of thrombosis (95% confidence interval, 1. 5-16. 8) than those with a normal PROS1 gene and no other recognized thrombophilic defect. Although pregnancy/puerperium and immobility/trauma were important precipitating factors for thrombosis, almost half of the events were spontaneous. Relatives with splice-site or major structural defects in the PROS1 gene were more likely to have had a thrombotic event and had significantly lower total and free protein S levels than those relatives having missense mutations. We conclude that persons with PROS1 gene defects and protein S deficiency are at increased risk of thrombosis and that free protein S estimation offers the most reliable way of diagnosing the deficiency. (Blood. 2000; 95 1935-1941).
Protein microarrays provide a powerful tool for the study of protein function. However, they are not widely used, in part because of the challenges in producing proteins to spot on the arrays. We generated protein microarrays by printing complementary DNAs onto glass slides and then translating target proteins with mammalian reticulocyte lysate. Epitope tags fused to the proteins allowed them to be immobilized in situ. This obviated the need to purify proteins, avoided protein stability problems during storage, and captured sufficient protein for functional studies. We used the technology to map pairwise interactions among 29 human DNA replication initiation proteins, recapitulate the regulation of Cdt1 binding to select replication proteins, and map its geminin-binding domain.

Proteinuria after conversion to sirolimus in renal transplant recipients.
Proteinuria is a side effect of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients. The possibility of reproducing the same renal abnormality with captopril was examined in SHR. Oral administration of captopril at 100 mg/kg for 14 days failed to aggravate proteinuria pre-existing in SHR. Also, captopril treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive proteinuria invoked by puromycin aminonucleoside in SHR. Captopril had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations, excretion of urine, sodium and potassium, endogenous creatinine clearance, body weight, and food and water consumption. However, ketone bodies were consistently present in urine and several lethalities occurred during multiple dosing of captopril in SHR.
Proteinuria is an expected complication in transplant patients treated with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR-i). However, clinical suspicion should always be supported by histological evidence in order to investigate potential alternate diagnoses such as acute or chronic rejection, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, or recurrent or de novo glomerulopathy. In this case we report the unexpected diagnosis of amyloidosis in a renal-transplant patient with pre-transplant monoclonal gammapathy of undetermined significance who developed proteinuria after conversion from tacrolimus to everolimus.
Proteolipid protein (PLP; M (r) 30, 000) is a highly conserved major polytopic membrane protein in myelin but its cellular function remains obscure. Neurological mutant mice can often provide model systems for human genetic disorders . Mutations of the X-chromosome-linked PLP gene are lethal, identified first in the jimpy mouse and subsequently in patients with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. The unexplained phenotype of these mutations includes degeneration and premature cell death of oligodendrocytes with associated hypomyelination. Here we show that a new mouse mutant rumpshaker is defined by the amino-acid substitution Ile-to-Thr at residue 186 in a membrane-embedded domain of PLP. Surprisingly, rumpshaker mice, although myelin-deficient, have normal longevity and a full complement of morphologically normal oligodendrocytes. Hypomyelination can thus be genetically separated from the PLP-dependent oligodendrocyte degeneration. We suggest that PLP has a vital function in glial cell development, distinct from its later role in myelin assembly, and that this dichotomy of action may explain the clinical spectrum of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease..

Protocadherin LKC, a new candidate for a tumor suppressor of colon and liver cancers, its association with contact inhibition of cell proliferation.
Protocadherins are a major subfamily of the cadherin superfamily, but little is known about their functions and intracellular signal transduction. We cloned a novel human protocadherin gene, containing seven EC domains, and identified functional aspects of this gene. The gene was predominantly expressed in liver, kidney and colon tissues, and was thus designated Protocadherin LKC. The expression of Protocadherin LKC is markedly reduced in cancers arising from these tissues at both transcriptional and protein levels. To investigate the effects of Protocadherin LKC expression in colon cancer, we introduced the gene into colon cancer cell line HCT116, which does not express this gene. Significantly, Protocadherin LKC expression induced contact inhibition of cell proliferation although it did not affect growth rate. When grown to post-confluence in monolayer cells cultures, Protocadherin LKC-expressing HCT116 no longer formed multiple cell layers and showed the typical paving stone morphology of normal epithelial cells. Furthermore, expression of Protocadherin LKC suppressed tumor formation of HCT116 cells in a nude mouse model. In addition, we identified a protein, hMAST205 (microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-205 kDa), which interacted with Protocadherin LKC; the interaction occurring between the PDZ domain of hMAST205 and C-terminal tail of Protocadherin LKC. Our results suggest that Protocadherin LKC, which directly binds PDZ protein, is a molecular switch for contact inhibition of epithelial cells in the liver, kidney and colon tissues.
Protocols of conversion from cyclosporin A (CsA) to sirolimus (SRL) have been widely used in immunotherapy after transplantation to prevent CsA-induced nephropathy, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these protocols remain nuclear. This study aimed to identify the molecular pathways and putative biomarkers of CsA-to-SRL conversion in a rat model. Four animal groups (n = 6) were tested during 9 weeks: control, CsA, SRL, and conversion (CsA for 3 weeks followed by SRL for 6 weeks). Classical and emergent serum, urinary, and kidney tissue (gene and protein expression) markers were assessed. Renal lesions were analyzed in hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson's trichrome stains. SRL-treated rats presented proteinuria and NGAL (serum and urinary) as the best markers of renal impairment. Short CsA treatment presented slight or even absent kidney lesions and TGF-b, NF- kb, mTOR, PCNA, TP53, KIM-1, and CTGF as relevant gene and protein changes. Prolonged CsA exposure aggravated renal damage, without clear changes on the traditional markers, but with changes in serums TGF- b and IL-7, TBARs clearance, and kidney TGF-b and mTOR. Conversion to SRL prevented CsA-induced renal damage evolution (absent/mild grade lesions), while NGAL (serum versus urine) seems to be a feasible biomarker of CsA replacement to SRL.
Providing pain management for known opioid abusers is a challenging clinical task, in part because little is known about their pain experience and analgesic requirements. This study was designed to describe pain tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of opioid addicts stabilized in methadone-maintenance (MM) treatment (n = 60) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects (n = 60). By using a placebo-controlled, two-way factorial design, tolerance to cold-pressor (CP) pain was examined, both before and after oral administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid (hydromorphone 2 mg) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (ketorolac 10 mg) analgesic agents. Results showed that MM individuals were significantly less tolerant of CP pain than control subjects, replicating previous work. Analgesic effects were significant neither for medication nor group. These data indicate that MM opioid abusers represent a pain-intolerant subset of clinical patients. Their complaints of pain should be evaluated seriously and managed aggressively.

Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a heritable disorder affecting the skin, eyes and cardiovascular system. It is caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene and its clinical picture is highly variable. PXE often leads to severe visual impairment due to the development of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). CNV in PXE-associated retinopathy is believed to be mediated by the action of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The objective of the present study was to evaluate a possible impact of variations in the VEGFA gene on ocular manifestations of PXE. For this purpose, we evaluated the distribution of 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter and coding region of the VEGFA gene in DNA samples from 163 German patients affected by PXE and in 163 healthy control subjects. Haplotype analysis of SNPs c.-1540A>C, c.-460C>T, c.-152G>A, c.405C>G, c.674C>T, c.1032C>T, c.4618C>T and c.5092C>A revealed that the haplotype CTGGCCCC was associated with PXE (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.33-3.15, P(corrected) = 0.01). Furthermore, five SNPs showed significant association with severe retinopathy. The most significant single SNP association was c.-460C>T (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.01-7.31, P(corrected) = 0.0003). Logistic regression analysis identified the c.-460T and the c.674C alleles as independent risk factors for development of severe retinopathy. Our findings suggest an involvement of VEGF in the pathogenesis of ocular PXE manifestations. VEGF gene polymorphisms might prove useful as prognostic markers for the development of PXE-associated retinopathy and permit earlier therapeutic intervention in order to prevent loss of central vision, one of the most devastating consequences of this disease.
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a heritable elastic tissue disorder recently shown to be attributable to mutations in the ABCC6 ( MRP6) gene. Whereas PXE has been identified in all ethnic groups studied to date, the prevalence of this disease in various populations is uncertain, although often assumed to be similar. A notable exception however is the prevalence of PXE among South African Afrikaners. A previous report has suggested that a founder effect may explain the higher prevalence of PXE in Afrikaners, a European-derived population that first settled in South Africa in the 17th century. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed haplotype and mutational analysis of DNA from 24 South African families of Afrikaner, British and Indian descent. Among the 17 Afrikaner families studied, three common haplotypes and six different disease-causing variants were identified. Three of these mutant alleles were missense variants, two were nonsense mutations and one was a single base-pair insertion. The most common variant accounted for 53% of the PXE alleles, whereas other mutant alleles appeared at lower frequencies ranging from 3% to 12%. Haplotype analysis of the Afrikaner families showed that the three most frequent mutations were identical-by-descent, indicating a founder origin of PXE in this population.
Pubertal exposure to Bisphenol A increases anxiety-like behavior and decreases acetylcholinesterase activity of hippocampus in adult male mice.
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a heterogeneous disorder of genetic or acquired etiologies. In some cases congenital PAP is associated with hereditary surfactant protein (SP)-B deficiency. To date, the molecular defect in the majority of patients with PAP has not been identified. In mice, PAP has been generated by targeted deletion of the genes for either the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta chain (beta c) or GM-CSF. Here, we describe an expression defect of beta c in three of seven pediatric patients with PAP and in one patient with severe lung disease suspected to be PAP. The patients failed to express normal levels of beta c as shown by flow cytometry. Strikingly reduced or absent function of beta c was demonstrated by ligand binding studies and progenitor clonogenic assays. Analysis of beta c DNA revealed a point mutation from proline to threonine at codon 602 in one patient. Our findings provide evidence that a defect in the expression of a hematopoietic cytokine receptor is associated with human PAP.

Pyrazinamide can have adverse effects such as hepatic toxicity, hyperuricemia or digestive disorders. In rare cases, alterations in taste and smell function have been reported for pyrazinamide when combined with other drugs. We report a case of reversible olfactory disorder related to pyrazinamide in a woman, with a positive rechallenge. The patient presented every day a sensation of smelling something burning 15 min after drug intake. Dysosmia disappeared completely after pyrazinamide withdrawal and recurred after its rechallenge. The case was reported to the Tunisian Centre of Pharmacovigilance.
Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) has a dual mechanism of action as an antioxidant and an inhibitor of the transcription factor kappa-beta. Both, production of reactive oxygen species as well as activation of NF-kappaB have been implicated in severe neuronal damage in different sub-regions of the hippocampus as well as in the surrounding cortices. The effect of PDTC on status epilepticus-associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated pilocarpine model. Treatment with 150 mg/kg PDTC before and following status epilepticus significantly increased the mortality rate to 100%. Administration of 50 mg/kg PDTC (low-dose) did not exert major effects on the development of a status epilepticus or the mortality rate. In vehicle-treated rats, status epilepticus caused pronounced neuronal damage in the piriform cortex comprising both pyramidal cells and interneurons. Low-dose PDTC treatment almost completely protected from lesions in the piriform cortex. A significant decrease in neuronal density of the hippocampal hilar formation was identified in vehicle- and PDTC-treated rats following status epilepticus. In conclusion, the NF-kappaB inhibitor and antioxidant PDTC protected the piriform cortex, whereas it did not affect hilar neuronal loss. These data might indicate that the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of NF-kappaB plays a more central role in seizure-associated neuronal damage in the temporal cortex as compared to the hippocampal hilus. However, future investigations are necessary to exactly analyze the biochemical mechanisms by which PDTC exerted its beneficial effects in the piriform cortex.

Pyruvate carboxylase (E. C. 6. 4. 1. 1) activity was determined in the circulating peripheral lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from the family of a patient with hepatic, cerebral, renal cortical, leukocyte, and fibroblast pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (PC Portland deficiency). Lymphocyte activities were mother, 33--39%; father, 11--29%; brother, 82--103%; and sister, 38--48% of the lowest normal. Fibroblasts from the patients mother and father had 42 and 34%, respectively, of the activity of the lowest normal. These data demonstrate that the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and that lymphocytes and fibroblasts can be used to detect carriers. Neither pyruvate carboxylase nor mitochondrial PEPCK activity in lymphocytes was increased by a 21-hr fast.

Quinacrine hydrochloride is toxic for the heart of F-344 rats. Rats treated with 500 ppm quinacrine hydrochloride in the diet all developed a high incidence of left atrial thrombosis. The lesion was associated with cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation and focal myocardial degeneration. Rats died from cardiac hypertrophy with severe acute and chronic congestion of the lungs, liver, and other organs. Seventy percent of rats given 250 ppm quinacrine hydrochloride and 1,000 ppm sodium nitrite simultaneously in the diet had thrombosis of the atria of the heart, while untreated control rats in this laboratory did not have atrial thrombosis. Sodium nitrite in combination with quinacrine hydrochloride appeared to have no additional effect.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The light-enhanced startle paradigm (LES) is suggested to model anxiety, because of the non-specific cue and the long-term effect. In contrast, the fear-potentiated startle (FPS) is suggested to model conditioned fear. However, the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar. The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms. METHODS: Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (0.25-1.0mg/kg), the 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP, 0.5-2.0mg/kg) or the GABA(A) inverse receptor agonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 3-30mg/kg) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS. RESULTS: None of the drugs enhanced LES, whereas mCPP increased percentage FPS and yohimbine increased absolute FPS values. Furthermore, yohimbine increased baseline startle amplitude in the LES, while mCPP suppressed baseline startle in both the LES and FPS and PTZ suppressed baseline startle in the FPS. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to findings in the FPS paradigm, none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the LES response. Thus, a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between LES and FPS.
RATIONALE: 5-Hydroxytryptamine, via stimulation of 5-HT 2C receptors, exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas activation of 5-HT 2A receptors enhances stimulated DAergic neurotransmission. The antidepressant trazodone is a 5-HT 2A/2C receptor antagonist. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of trazodone treatment on behaviors dependent on the functional status of the nigrostriatal DAergic system. METHODS: The effect of pretreatment with trazodone on dexamphetamine- and apomorphine-induced oral stereotypies, on catalepsy induced by haloperidol and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.), on ergometrine-induced wet dog shake (WDS) behavior and fluoxetine-induced penile erections was studied in rats. We also investigated whether trazodone induces catalepsy in rats. RESULTS: Trazodone at 2.5-20 mg/kg i.p. did not induce catalepsy, and did not antagonize apomorphine (1.5 and 3 mg/kg) stereotypy and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg)-induced catalepsy. However, pretreatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p. trazodone enhanced dexamphetamine stereotypy, and antagonized haloperidol catalepsy, ergometrine-induced WDS behavior and fluoxetine-induced penile erections. Trazodone at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg i.p. induced catalepsy and antagonized apomorphine and dexamphetamine stereotypies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that trazodone at 2.5-20 mg/kg does not block pre- and postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors, while at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg it blocks postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors. Furthermore, at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, trazodone blocks 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors. We suggest that trazodone (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg), by blocking the 5-HT 2C receptors, releases the nigrostriatal DAergic neurons from tonic inhibition caused by 5-HT, and thereby potentiates dexamphetamine stereotypy and antagonizes haloperidol catalepsy.
RATIONALE: Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is a worldwide recreational drug of abuse. Unfortunately, the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT-related behaviors; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years, and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances. METHODS: A sample of 997 participants (52 % male) was recruited to four control groups (non-drug (ND), alcohol/nicotine (AN), cannabis/alcohol/nicotine (CAN), non-ecstasy polydrug (PD)), and two ecstasy polydrug groups (present (MDMA) and past users (EX-MDMA). Participants completed a drug history questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised which, in total, provided 13 psychometric measures. RESULTS: While the CAN and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non-drug controls, the MDMA and EX-MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures. Strikingly, despite prolonged abstinence (mean, 4.98; range, 4-9 years), past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery. Compared with present ecstasy users, the past users showed no change for ten measures, increased impairment for two measures, and improvement on just one measure. CONCLUSIONS: Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression, impulsiveness, and sleep disturbance, the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern.
RATIONALE: Ecstasy (MDMA) is a psychostimulant drug which is increasingly associated with psychobiological dysfunction. While some recent studies suggest acute changes in neuroendocrine function, less is known about long-term changes in HPA functionality in recreational users. OBJECTIVES: The current study is the first to explore the effects of ecstasy-polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the HPA axis through assessing the secretion of cortisol across the diurnal period. METHOD: Seventy-six participants (21 nonusers, 29 light ecstasy-polydrug users, 26 heavy ecstasy-polydrug users) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline, then two consecutive days of cortisol sampling (on awakening, 30 min post awakening, between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime). On day 2, participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20-min multitasking stressor. RESULTS: Both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of anxiety and depression than nonusers. On day 1, all participants exhibited a typical cortisol profile, though light users had significantly elevated levels pre-bed. On day 2, heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all ecstasy-polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre-bed levels compared to non-users. Significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon cortisol levels and in overall cortisol secretion across the day. CONCLUSIONS: The increases in anxiety and depression are in line with previous observations in recreational ecstasy-polydrug users. Dysregulated diurnal cortisol may be indicative of inappropriate anticipation of forthcoming demands and hypersecretion may lead to the increased psychological and physical morbidity associated with heavy recreational use of ecstasy.
RATIONALE: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant widely used by pregnant women. Epidemiological data suggest that fluoxetine exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent pulmonary hypertension syndrome of the newborn. The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical, considering the current evidence of a pulmonary hypertension protective fluoxetine effect in adult rodents. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the fluoxetine effect on fetal rat pulmonary vascular smooth muscle mechanical properties and cell proliferation rate. METHODS: Pregnant rats were treated with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) from Day 11 through Day 21 of gestation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fetuses were delivered by cesarean section. As compared with controls, fluoxetine exposure resulted in fetal pulmonary hypertension as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum (P = 0.02) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness (P < 0.01). Postnatal mortality was increased among experimental animals, and arterial oxygen saturation was 96 +/- 1% in 1-day-old control animals and significantly lower (P < 0.01) in fluoxetine-exposed pups (79 +/- 2%). In vitro, fluoxetine induced pulmonary arterial muscle contraction in fetal, but not adult, animals (P < 0.01) and reduced serotonin-induced contraction at both ages (P < 0.01). After in utero exposure to a low fluoxetine concentration the pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation rate was significantly increased in fetal, but not adult, cells (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the adult, fluoxetine exposure in utero induces pulmonary hypertension in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation.
RATIONALE: NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), an inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), induces catalepsy in mice. This effect undergoes rapid tolerance, showing a significant decrease after 2 days of sub-chronic L-NOARG treatment. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to influence dopaminergic neurotransmission in the striatum. Neuroleptic drugs such as haloperidol, which block dopamine receptors, also cause catalepsy in rodents. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of subchronic L-NOARG treatment in haloperidol-induced catalepsy and the number of NOS neurons in areas related to motor control. METHODS: Male albino Swiss mice were treated sub-chronically (twice a day for 4 days) with L-NOARG (40 mg/kg i.p.) or haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.). Catalepsy was evaluated at the beginning and the end of the treatments. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry was also employed to visualize NOS as an index of enzyme expression in mice brain regions related to motor control. RESULTS: L-NOARG sub-chronic administration produced tolerance of L-NOARG and of haloperidol-induced catalepsy. It also induced an increase in the number of NADPH-d-positive cells in the dorsal part of the caudate and accumbens nuclei compared with haloperidol and in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus compared with saline. In contrast, there was a decrease in NADPH-d neuron number in the substantia nigra, pars compacta in both haloperidol-treated and L-NOARG-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: The results give further support to the hypothesis that NO plays a role in motor behavior control and suggest that it may take part in the synaptic changes produced by antipsychotic treatment.
RATIONALE: Nicotine and caffeine are widely consumed licit psychoactive drugs worldwide. Epidemiological studies showed that they were generally used concurrently. Although some studies in experimental animals indicate clear pharmacological interactions between them, no studies have shown a specific interaction on anxiety responses. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigates the effects of nicotine on anxiety induced by caffeine and another anxiogenic drug, pentylenetetrazole, in mice. The elevated plus-maze (EPM) test was used to evaluate the effects of drugs on anxiety. METHODS: Adult male Swiss Webster mice (25-32 g) were given nicotine (0.05-0.25 mg/kg s.c.) or saline 10 min before caffeine (70 mg/kg i.p.) or pentylenetetrazole (15 and 30 mg/kg i.p.) injections. After 15 min, mice were evaluated for their open- and closed-arm time and entries on the EPM for a 10-min session. Locomotor activity was recorded for individual groups by using the same treatment protocol with the EPM test. RESULTS: Nicotine (0.05-0.25 mg/kg) itself did not produce any significant effect in the EPM test, whereas caffeine (70 mg/kg) and pentylenetetrazole (30 mg/kg) produced an anxiogenic effect, apparent with decreases in open-arm time and entry. Nicotine (0.25 mg/kg) pretreatment blocked the caffeine- but not pentylenetetrazole-induced anxiety. Administration of each drug and their combinations did not produce any effect on locomotor activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the antagonistic effect of nicotine on caffeine-induced anxiety is specific to caffeine, instead of a non-specific anxiolytic effect. Thus, it may extend the current findings on the interaction between nicotine and caffeine.
RATIONALE: gamma-Vinyl GABA (GVG) irreversibly inhibits GABA-transaminase. This non-receptor mediated inhibition requires de novo synthesis for restoration of functional GABA catabolism. OBJECTIVES: Given its preclinical success for treating substance abuse and the increased risk of visual field defects (VFD) associated with cumulative lifetime exposure, we explored the effects of sub-chronic low dose GVG on cocaine-induced increases in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopamine (DA). METHODS: Using in vivo microdialysis, we compared acute exposure (450 mg/kg) to an identical sub-chronic exposure (150 mg/kg per day for 3 days), followed by 1- or 3-day washout. Finally, we examined the low dose of 150 mg/kg (50 mg/kg per day) using a similar washout period. RESULTS: Sub-chronic GVG exposure inhibited the effect of cocaine for 3 days, which exceeded in magnitude and duration the identical acute dose. CONCLUSIONS: Sub-chronic low dose GVG potentiates and extends the inhibition of cocaine-induced increases in dopamine, effectively reducing cumulative exposures and the risk for VFDS.
REM sleep deprivation changes behavioral response to catecholaminergic and serotonergic receptor activation in rats.
RING-finger proteins play crucial roles in ubiquitination events involved in diverse cellular processes including signal transduction, differentiation and apoptosis. Most of the RING-finger proteins have E3-ubiquitin ligase activity. RNF11 is a small RING-finger protein and harbors a RING-H2 domain and a PY motif that could facilitate protein:protein interaction(s) involved in oncogenesis. To isolate RNF11 protein partners and determine its role in normal and cancer cells, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening. Among 18 in-frame positive clones, three were found to be ZBRK1, Eps15 and AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM). ZBRK1 is a KRAB domain containing Zinc-finger protein and is known to repress target gene transcription in a BRCA1-dependent manner. Eps15 is monoubiquitinated and is part of an essential complex involved in the endocytosis of plasma membrane receptors via the clathrin-mediated internalization pathway. Recent studies have shown that AMSH protein is involved in BMP/TGF-beta signaling pathway by binding to Smad6 and Smad7. The association of RNF11 with these binding partners suggests that it would be involved in biological processes such as gene transcription, BMP/TGF-beta signaling and ubiquitination-associated events. Previously, we have shown that RNF11 interacts with the HECT-type E3 ligases AIP4 and Smurf2. Here, we show that RNF11 binds to AMSH in mammalian cells and that this interaction is independent of the RNF11 RING-finger domain and the PY motif. Our results also demonstrate that AMSH is ubiquitinated by Smurf2 E3 ligase in the presence of RNF11 and that a consequent reduction in its steady-state level requires both RNF11 and Smurf2. RNF11 therefore recruits AMSH to Smurf2 for ubiquitination, leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome. The potential functions of RNF11-mediated degradation of AMSH in breast cancer are discussed.
Rab6 is phosphorylated in thrombin-activated platelets by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism: effects on GTP/GDP binding and cellular distribution.
Rab6c, a new member of the rab gene family, is involved in drug resistance in MCF7/AdrR cells.
Rab8 is a small GTP-binding protein that plays a role in vesicular transport from the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells (MDCK), and to the dendritic surface in hippocampal neurons. As is the case for most other rab proteins, the precise molecular interactions by which rab8 carries out its function remain to be elucidated. Here we report the identification and the complete cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of a murine rab8-interacting protein (rab8ip) that specifically interacts with rab8 in a GTP-dependent manner. Rab8ip displays 93% identity with the GC kinase, a serine/threonine protein kinase recently identified in human lymphoid tissue that is activated in the stress response. Like the GC kinase, rab8ip has protein kinase activity manifested by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the classical serine/threonine protein kinase substrates, myelin basic protein and casein. When coexpressed in transfected 293T cells, rab8 and the rab8ip/GC kinase formed a complex that could be recovered by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to rab8. Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence analyses indicate that in MDCK cells endogenous rab8ip is present both in the cytosol and as a peripheral membrane protein concentrated in the Golgi region and basolateral plasma membrane domains, sites where rab8 itself is also located. In light of recent evidence that rab proteins may act by promoting the stabilization of SNARE complexes, the specific GTP-dependent association of rab8 with the rab8ip/GC kinase raises the possibility that rab-regulated protein phosphorylation is important for vesicle targeting or fusion. Moreover, the rab8ip/GC kinase may serve to modulate secretion in response to stress stimuli.
Rabbit syndrome (RS) is a rare extrapyramidal side effect caused by prolonged neuroleptic medication. Here we present a case of withdrawal-emergent RS, which is the first of its kind to be reported. The patient developed RS during dose reduction of risperidone. The symptom was treated successfully with trihexyphenidyl anticholinergic therapy. The underlying mechanism of withdrawal-emergent RS in the present case may have been related to the pharmacological profile of risperidone, a serotonin-dopamine antagonist, suggesting the pathophysiologic influence of the serotonin system in the development of RS.
Rabbit syndrome, antidepressant use, and cerebral perfusion SPECT scan findings.
Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), an analog of norepinephrine (NE), serves as an index of adrenergic neuron integrity and function. Using a rat model of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose-dependently in adriamycin cardiomyopathy. The degree of vacuolar degeneration of myocardial cells was analyzed in relation to the duration of adriamycin treatment (2 mg/kg, once a week). There were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1- or 2-wk treatment groups, isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3-wk group, frequent scattered degeneration in the 4-wk group, scattered or focal degeneration in the 5-wk group, and extensive degeneration in the 8-wk group. Myocardial accumulation of [125I]MIBG 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less. However, the 4-wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall (82% of the control) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall (about 66% of the control: p less than 0.05). In the 5-wk group, MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35% and 27% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001). In the 8-wk group, MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18% and 14% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001). Thus, MIBG accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an adriamycin dose-dependent manner. The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight myocardial impairment (scattered or focal vacuolar degeneration) indicates that MIBG scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time. A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin-independent effects. Diagnostic markers such as N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or high-sensitive C-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity.

Randomized, double-blind trial of mazindol in Duchenne dystrophy.
Ranitidine frequently is used for preventing peptic ulceration after renal transplantation. This drug occasionally has been associated with acute interstitial nephritis in native kidneys. There are no similar reports with renal transplantation. We report a case of ranitidine-induced acute interstitial nephritis in a recipient of a cadaveric renal allograft presenting with acute allograft dysfunction within 48 hours of exposure to the drug. The biopsy specimen showed pathognomonic features, including eosinophilic infiltration of the interstitial compartment. Allograft function improved rapidly and returned to baseline after stopping the drug.

Rare germline mutations of macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) gene were reported to be associated with prostate cancer risk in families with hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) and in patients with non-HPC (Xu et al. 2002). To further evaluate the role of MSR1 in prostate cancer susceptibility, at Johns Hopkins Hospital, we studied five common variants of MSR1 in 301 patients with non-HPC who underwent prostate cancer treatment and in 250 control subjects who participated in prostate cancer-screening programs and had normal digital rectal examination and PSA levels (<4 ng/ml). Significantly different allele frequencies between case subjects and control subjects were observed for each of the five variants (P value range.01-.04). Haplotype analyses provided consistent findings, with a significant difference in the haplotype frequencies from a global score test (P=.01). Because the haplotype that is associated with the increased risk for prostate cancer did not harbor any of the known rare mutations, it appears that the observed association of common variants and prostate cancer risk are independent of the effect of the known rare mutations. These results consistently suggest that MSR1 may play an important role in prostate carcinogenesis.

Rat liver mRNA encoding the cytoplasmic precursor of mitochondrial isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase was highly enriched by polysome immunopurification using a polyclonal monospecific antibody. The purified mRNA was used to prepare a plasmid cDNA library which was screened with two oligonucleotide mixtures encoding two peptides in the amino-terminal portion of mature rat isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase. Thirty-one overlapping cDNA clones, spanning a region of 2.1 kbp, were isolated and characterized. The cDNA sequence of a 5'-end clone, rIVD-13 (155 bp), predicts a mitochondrial leader peptide of 30 amino acid residues and the first 18 amino acids of the mature protein. These consecutive 18 residues completely matched the amino-terminal peptide determined by automated Edman degradation of the rat enzyme. The leader peptide contains six arginines, has no acidic residues, and is particularly rich in leucine, alanine, and proline residues. Southern blot analysis of DNAs from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids with an isolated rat cDNA (2 kbp) assigned the isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase gene to the long arm of chromosome 15, region q14----qter. The chromosomal assignment was confirmed and further refined to bands q14----q15 by in situ hybridization of the probe to human metaphase cells. This location differs from that of the gene for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a closely related enzyme, which has been previously assigned to chromosome 1.
Rat liver serine dehydratase cDNA was used to screen a human liver cDNA library in lambda gt11. One positive clone occurred in every 5,000 clones. Fifteen positive clones were plaque purified. The largest cDNA obtained contained an open reading frame of 987 base pairs, and 5' and 3' noncoding regions of 89 and 317 base pairs, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence, with a calculated Mr of 34,615, was similar to that of rat liver serine dehydratase except for the absence of a segment consisting of 36 amino acid residues. In vitro transcription/translation with the cDNA resulted in the formation of a polypeptide with an Mr of approximately 35,000, which cross-reacted with the anti-rat serine dehydratase antibody. These results suggest that the human serine dehydratase is structurally cognate with the rat enzyme. Moreover, portions of the sequence postulated to be essential for activity in microbial threonine dehydratases are found in the mammalian serine dehydratases, suggesting that hydroxyamino and dehydratases may have originated from a common ancestor.

Rats were pretreated with saline or nicotine (1.5 mg/kg per day) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an Alzet osmotic mini-pump which continuously released saline or nicotine for 1, 5 and 14 days. At the end of each pretreatment period, animals were used for (i) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected nicotine (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) and (ii) measuring the density of L-[3H]nicotine and [3H]spiperone binding sites in the striatum. We observed no changes in nicotine-induced locomotor response, striatal L-[3H]nicotine and [3H]spiperone binding in the animals pretreated with nicotine for 1 day. In rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days, there was a significant increase in the nicotine-stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated dopamine (DA) level in the striatum. The number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites was not affected. In animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days, the nicotine-induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated. However, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites, whereas the number of striatal L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and the striatal DA level were normal. These results suggest that chronic nicotine-treated rats develop locomotor hyperactivity in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and DA concentration, followed by inducing DA receptor supersensitivity in the striatum.
Rats with lithium-induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein (HP) feeding, uninephrectomy (NX) or a combination of these, in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure. Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium-containing diet (50 mmol/kg) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet, HP diet (40 vs. 19%), NX or HP+NX for another 8 weeks. Corresponding non-lithium pretreated groups were generated. When comparing all lithium treated versus non-lithium-treated groups, lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow (as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or lithium clearance. Consequently, lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion. Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis. HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats. NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which, however, was ameliorated by HP. NX+HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li-pretreated rats. The results indicate that Li-induced nephropathy, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension. In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli. The fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced, leaving the distal delivery unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Re-evaluation of the sublocalization of esterase D and its relation to the retinoblastoma locus by in situ hybridization.
Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephropathy, with antioxidants significantly reducing the proteinuria. The temporal relationship between lipid peroxidation in the kidney and proteinuria was examined in this study. Rats were treated with a single IV injection of puromycin aminonucleoside, (PAN, 7.5 mg/kg) and 24 hour urine samples were obtained prior to sacrifice on days 3,5,7,10,17,27,41 (N = 5-10 per group). The kidneys were removed, flushed with ice cold TRIS buffer. Kidney cortices from each animal were used to prepare homogenates. Tissue lipid peroxidation was measured in whole homogenates as well as in lipid extracts from homogenates as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Proteinuria was evident at day 5, peaked at day 7 and persisted to day 27. Lipid peroxidation in homogenates was maximal at day 3 and declined rapidly to control levels by day 17. This study supports the role of lipid peroxidation in mediating the proteinuric injury in PAN nephropathy.
Rearrangement of the BCL1 (B-cell lymphoma 1) region on chromosome 11q13 appears to be highly characteristic of centrocytic lymphoma and also is found infrequently in other B-cell neoplasms. Rearrangement is thought to deregulate a nearby protooncogene, but transcribed sequences in the immediate vicinity of BCL1 breakpoints had not been identified. PRAD1, previously designated D11S287E, was identified on 11q13 as a chromosomal breakpoint region rearranged with the parathyroid hormone gene in a subset of parathyroid adenomas; this highly conserved putative oncogene, which encodes a novel cyclin, has been linked to BCL1 and implicated also in subsets of breast and squamous cell neoplasms with 11q13 amplification. We report pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data showing BCL1 and PRAD1 to be no more than 130 kilobases apart. PRAD1 mRNA is abundantly expressed in seven of seven centrocytic lymphomas (Kiel classification), in contrast to 13 closely related but noncentrocytic lymphomas. Three of the seven centrocytic lymphomas had detectable BCL1 DNA rearrangement. Also, two unusual cases of CLL with BCL1 rearrangement overexpressed PRAD1, in contrast to five CLL controls. Thus, PRAD1 is an excellent candidate " BCL1 oncogene. " Its overexpression may be a key consequence of rearrangement of the BCL1 vicinity in B-cell neoplasms and a unifying pathogenetic feature in centrocytic lymphoma.
Rebound hypertensive after sodium nitroprusside prevented by saralasin in rats.
Recent findings in a bipolar patient receiving maintenance lithium therapy who developed hypercalcemia and severe bradyarrhythmia prompted the authors to conduct a retrospective study of bipolar patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia. A printout of all cases of hypercalcemia that presented during a 1-year period was generated. After eliminating spurious hypercalcemias or those associated with intravenous fluids, the authors identified 18 non-lithium-treated patients with hypercalcemias related to malignancies and other medical conditions (group A) and 12 patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia (group B). Patients in group B were not comparable to those in group A, as the latter were medically compromised and were receiving multiple pharmacotherapies. Thus, two control groups were generated: group C1, which included age- and sex-comparable lithium-treated bipolar normocalcemic patients, and group C2, which included bipolar normocalcemic patients treated with anticonvulsant mood stabilizers. The electrocardiographic (ECG) findings for patients in group B were compared with those of patients in groups C1 and C2. It was found that these groups did not differ in their overall frequency of ECG abnormalities; however, there were significant differences in the frequency of conduction defects. Patients with hypercalcemia resulting from medical diseases and bipolar patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia had significantly higher frequencies of conduction defects. Patients in group A had significant mortality at 2-year follow-up (28%), in contrast to zero mortality in the other three groups. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
Recent genetic studies have suggested that PAX4, a member of the paired box (PAX) gene family, is involved in the mechanism regulating the fate of pancreatic islet endocrine progenitor cells. Murine PAX4 was originally identified by genomic screening and, to date, only a partial sequence of PAX4 has been reported. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of mouse PAX4 by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) using RNA from MIN6 cells, a mouse insulinoma cell line. The full length of cDNA was 1.38 kb, consistent with the estimated size of the transcript by Northern blot. The deduced mouse PAX4 protein was 349 amino acids and had the predicted molecular weight of 38 kDa. Two DNA binding motifs, a 128-amino acid paired domain and a 61-amino acid paired-type homeodomain exhibit the highest amino acid homology with PAX6 (71.2%, 65.0%, respectively), another member of the PAX gene family. However, the sequence of the C-terminal segment of PAX4 diverged and showed no significant homology with any other known PAX genes. As to the genomic DNA, the coding region of the mouse PAX4 gene spanned approximately 5.5 kb and was composed of 10 exons. In the public DNA database, a human cosmid (g1572c264), which was localized on human chromosome 7q31.3, was found to contain a gene homologous to PAX4. The nucleotide and protein sequence homologies between mouse PAX4 and its human homologue were 83.1% and 80.0%, respectively. Interestingly, the ARP5 (ADP-ribosylation factor 5) gene was also found in the same cosmid g1572c264, suggesting the ARP5 gene to be adjacent to the human PAX4 homologue. The human cosmid g1572c264 contains at least four SSRPs (simple sequence repeat polymorphism), which could be used for genetic linkage studies of the locus. The results of this study, i.e. isolation of the full-length cDNA sequence of PAX4 and identification of the homologous human gene, will facilitate further functional and genetic studies of the PAX4 gene.
Recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB 3717).
Recent progress has resulted in part of the gene mutated in Duchenne and the milder Becker muscular dystrophies being cloned and has suggested that the gene itself extends over 1, 000 to 2, 000 kilobases (kb). To study how mutations in this gene affect muscle development and integrity, it would be of interest to have available a mouse model of the human disease. The mouse mdx mutation affects muscle and confers a mild dystrophic syndrome, but it is not clear whether this mutation is equivalent to Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy in man. Here we describe the use of two sequences from the human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene that cross-hybridize to mouse X-linked sequences to localize the gene homologous to DMD in the mouse. Both sequences map to the region of 10 centimorgan lying between the Tabby (Ta) and St14-1 (DxPas8) loci, close to the phosphorylase b kinase locus (Phk). By analogy with the human X-chromosome, we conclude that the region in the mouse around the G6pd and St14-1 loci may contain two genes corresponding to distinct human myopathies Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy which is known to be closely linked to St14-1 in man and the DMD homologue described here..
Recent progress in cataloguing common genetic variation has made possible genome-wide studies that are beginning to elucidate the causes and consequences of our genetic differences. Approaches that provide a mechanistic understanding of how genetic variants function to alter disease susceptibility and why they were substrates of natural selection would complement other approaches to human-genome analysis. Here we use a novel cell-based screen of bacterial infection to identify human variation in Salmonella-induced cell death. A loss-of-function allele of CARD8, a reported inhibitor of the proinflammatory protease caspase-1, was associated with increased cell death in vitro (p = 0.013). The validity of this association was demonstrated through overexpression of alternative alleles and RNA interference in cells of varying genotype. Comparison of mammalian CARD8 orthologs and examination of variation among different human populations suggest that the increase in infectious-disease burden associated with larger animal groups (i.e., herds and colonies), and possibly human population expansion, may have naturally selected for loss of CARD8. We also find that the loss-of-function CARD8 allele shows a modest association with an increased risk of systemic inflammatory response syndrome in a small study (p = 0.05). Therefore, a by-product of the selected benefit of loss of CARD8 could be increased inflammatory diseases. These results demonstrate the utility of genome-wide cell-based association screens with microbes in the identification of naturally selected variants that can impact human health.
Recent reports have demonstrated that mutations in the OPHN1 gene were responsible for a syndromic rather than non-specific mental retardation. Abnormalities of the posterior fossa with cerebellar hypoplasia have been demonstrated in all male patients reported to date. We report here a new family with X-linked mental retardation due to mutation in OPHN1 and present unpublished data about two families previously reported, concerning the facial and psychological phenotype of affected males and carrier females. Our study confirms that cerebellar hypoplasia is a hallmark of this syndrome. In addition, affected males display facial similarities that can help the diagnosis. Most carrier females have mild mental retardation and subtle facial changes.
Recent studies demonstrated the existence of a genetically distinct, usually lethal form of the Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS) of myotonia and skeletal dysplasia, which we called SJS type 2. This disorder is reminiscent of another rare condition, the Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome (SWS), which comprises campomelia at birth with skeletal dysplasia, contractures, and early death. To test for possible nosologic identity between these disorders, we reviewed the literature and obtained a follow-up of the only two surviving patients, one with SJS type 2 at age 10 years and another with SWS at age 7 years. Patients reported as having either neonatal SJS or SWS presented a combination of a severe, prenatal-onset neuromuscular disorder (with congenital joint contractures, respiratory and feeding difficulties, tendency to hyperthermia, and frequent death in infancy) with a distinct campomelic-metaphyseal skeletal dysplasia. The similarity of the clinical and radiographic findings is so extensive that these disorders appear to be a single entity. The follow-up observation of an identical and unique pattern of progressive bone dysplasia in the two patients (one with SJS type 2, one with SWS) surviving beyond infancy adds to the evidence in favor of identity. The hypothesis that SWS and SJS type 2 are the same disorder should be testable by molecular methods..
Recent studies have shown that hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is likely to be caused by homozygosity for a Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene located 4. 5 Mb telomeric to HLA-A. Population studies of this polymorphism are facilitated by the fact that the Cys282Tyr mutation creates a Rsal restriction site. We have studied the codon 282 (Cys/Tyr) polymorphism in different ethnic groups. In agreement with previous observations the Tyr allele appeared to be rare or absent in Asiatic (Indian, Chinese) populations. The highest allele frequency (7. 5%) was found in Swedes. Saamis (2%) and Mordvinians (1. 8%) had significantly lower frequencies of the Tyr allele. Comparisons with allele frequencies based on prevalence estimates of HH showed some disagreements with the RFLP data, particularly in Finns. The newly described HFE marker provides a new approach to the screening of HH as well as studies of the relationship between the HFE Tyr allele and different disorders including cancer
Recent studies revealed a striking difference in the genomic organization of classic cadherin genes and one family of "nonclassic cadherin" genes designated protocadherins. Specifically, the DNA sequences encoding the ectodomain repeats of classic cadherins are interrupted by multiple introns. By contrast, all of the encoded ectodomains of each member of the protocadherin gene clusters are present in one large exon. To determine whether large ectodomain exons are a general feature of protocadherin genes we have investigated the genomic organization of several additional human protocadherin genes by using DNA sequence information in GenBank. These genes include protocadherin 12 (Pcdh12), an ortholog of the mouse vascular endothelial cadherin-2 gene; hFmi1 and hFmi2, homologs of the Drosophila planar cell polarity gene, flamingo; hFat2, a homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene fat; and the Drosophila DN-cadherin and DE-cadherin genes. Each of these genes was found to be a member of the protocadherin subfamily, based on amino acid sequence comparisons of their ectodomains. Remarkably, all of these protocadherin genes share a common feature: most of the genomic DNA sequences encoding their ectodomains are not interrupted by an intron. We conclude that the presence of unusually large exons is a characteristic feature of protocadherin genes.
Recent work has identified a mouse gene (tsg101) whose inactivation in fibroblasts results in cellular transformation and the ability to produce metastatic tumors in nude mice. Here, we report that the human homolog, TSG101, which we isolated and mapped to chromosome 11, bands 15. 1-15 1-15. 2, a region proposed to contain tumor suppressor gene (s), is mutated at high frequency in human breast cancer. In 7 of 15 uncultured primary human breast carcinomas, intragenic deletions were shown in TSG101 genomic DNA and transcripts by gel and sequence analysis, and mutations affecting two TSG101 alleles were identified in four of these cancers. No TSG101 defects were found in matched normal breast tissue from the breast cancer patients. These findings strongly implicate TSG101 mutations in human breast cancer
Recently cDNA encoding the histamine H3 receptor was isolated after 15 years of considerable research. However, several studies have proposed heterogeneity of the H3 receptor. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel type of histamine receptor. A novel orphan G-protein-coupled receptor named GPRv53 was obtained through a search of the human genomic DNA data base and analyzed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). GPRv53 possessed the features of biologic amine receptors and had the highest homology with H3 receptor among known G-protein-coupled receptors. Mammalian cells expressing GPRv53 were demonstrated to bind and respond to histamine in a concentration-dependent manner. In functional assays, not only an H3 receptor agonist, R-(alpha)-methylhistamine, but also a H3 receptor antagonist, clobenpropit, and a neuroleptic, clozapine, activated GPRv53-expressing cells. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that expression of GPRv53 is localized in the peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, thymus, and colon, which was totally different from the H3 receptor, whose expression was restricted to the brain. The discovery of the GPRv53 receptor will open a new phase of research on the physiological role of histamine.
Recently we have isolated the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene which causes familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and its germ-line mutations in a substantial number of FAP patients have been identified. On the basis of this information, we compared the location of germ-line mutations in the APC gene in 22 unrelated patients (12 of whom have been reported previously) with the number of colorectal polyps developed in FAP patients; 17 were sparse types and five were profuse types. All but one of the mutations were considered to cause truncation of the gene product by frame-shift due to deletion (14 cases) or nonsense mutation (seven cases). The location of the germ-line mutations seems to correlate with the two clinical types; germ-line mutations in five FAP patients with profuse polyps were observed between codon 1250 and codon 1464, whereas mutations in 17 FAP patients with fewer polyps were observed in the other regions of the APC gene. The result suggests that the number of colorectal polyps in FAP patients may be associated with a difference in the stability or biological function of the truncated APC protein..
Recently, Na+/Pi cotransport activity has been demonstrated in rat liver hepatocytes. Here, we report the isolation of two Na+/Pi cotransporter cDNAs (RNaPi-1a and RNaPi-1b) from a rat liver cDNA library. The two cDNAs have the same coding but different 5'-untranslated regions. The rat cDNAs encode a polypeptide of 465 amino acids, having 62% and 66% identity with the rabbit NaPi-1 and human kidney Na+/Pi cotransporter, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that a RNaPi-1a--specific probe detected two major transcripts (2.3 and 1.8 kb), whereas a RNaPi-1b--specific probe hybridized with one transcript (1.8 kb) in rat kidney, liver, and hepatocytes in primary culture. Rat liver expressed much higher levels of RNaPi-1a than RNaPi-1b, whereas the converse was true for rat kidney. Low levels of RNaPi-1 mRNAs were also detected in rat heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. These findings indicate that there are at least two isoforms of RNaPi-1 transcripts expressed in liver and kidney and that the levels of expression of the RNaPi-1a and RNaPi-1b may be controlled by tissue-specific factors.
Recently, a 6-kb duplication of exon 13, which creates a frameshift in the coding sequence of the BRCA1 gene, has been described in three unrelated U. S S. families of European ancestry and in one Portuguese family. Here, our goal was to estimate the frequency and geographic diversity of carriers of this duplication. To do this, a collaborative screening study was set up that involved 39 institutions from 19 countries and included 3, 580 unrelated individuals with a family history of the disease and 934 early-onset breast and/or ovarian cancer cases. A total of 11 additional families carrying this mutation were identified in Australia (1), Belgium (1), Canada (1), Great Britain (6), and the United States (2). Haplotyping showed that they are likely to derive from a common ancestor, possibly of northern British origin. Our results demonstrate that it is strongly advisable, for laboratories carrying out screening either in English-speaking countries or in countries with historical links with Britain, to include within their BRCA1 screening protocols the polymerase chain reaction-based assay described in this report.
Recently, haplotype-based association studies have become popular for detecting disease-related or drug-response-associated genes. In these studies, it has been gradually recognized that a haplotype block structure is important. A rational and automatic method for identifying the haplotype block structure from SNP data has been desired. We have developed a new method using an ancestor-derived model and the minimum description length principle. The proposed method was applied to real data on the TAP2 gene in which a recombination hotspot was previously reported in human sperm data. The proposed method could identify an appropriate haplotype block structure, while existing methods failed. The performance of the proposed method was also investigated in a simulation study. The proposed method presented a better performance in real data analysis and the simulation study than existing methods. The proposed method was powerful from the viewpoint of hotspot sensitivity and was robust to mutation except at the edge of a sequence.
Recently, the gene for the most common peroxisomal disorder, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), has been described encoding a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein. We analyzed the entire protein-coding sequence of this gene by reverse-transcription PCR, SSCP, and DNA sequencing in five patients with different clinical expression of X-ALD and in their female relatives; these clinical expressions were cerebral childhood ALD, adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), and " Addison disease only " (ADO) phenotype. In the three patients exhibiting the classical picture of severe childhood ALD we identified in the 5 portion of the X-ALD gene a 38-bp deletion that causes a frameshift mutation, a 3-bp deletion leading to a deletion of an amino acid in the ATP-binding domain of the ALD protein, and a missense mutation. In the patient with the clinical phenotype of AMN, a nonsense mutation in codon 212, along with a second site mutation at codon 178, was observed. Analysis of the patient with the ADO phenotype revealed a further missense mutation at a highly conserved position in the ALDP/PMP70 comparison. The disruptive nature of two mutations (i. e., the frameshift and the nonsense mutation) in patients with biochemically proved childhood ALD and AMN further strongly supports the hypothesis that alterations in this gene play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of X-ALD. Since the current biochemical techniques for X-ALD carrier detection in affected families lack sufficient reliability, our procedure described for systematic mutation scanning is also capable of improving genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis
Recently, we and others have isolated a candidate gene for X linked Norrie disease (ND) which was found to be deleted or disrupted in several patients. As a prerequisite for the identification of point mutations in the ND gene we have established the exon-intron structure of this gene. In 17 unrelated patients and 15 controls, PCR products derived from the promoter region, exons 1 and 2 as well as the coding part of exon 3 were analysed with the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique. In 12 patients altered PCR fragments were detected which were studied in detail by direct sequencing. Eleven different mutations were found, and all but one are likely to give rise to significant structural changes in the predicted protein. These findings, and the absence of functionally relevant base changes in healthy controls, emphasize the causal role of this candidate gene in Norrie disease and pave the way for reliable diagnosis and carrier detection..
Recently, we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of nicotinic acid amide, a selective inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; EC 2.4.2.30) on mice suffering from acetaminophen (AAP)-hepatitis, suggesting that the AAP-induced liver injury involves a step which depends on adenoribosylation. The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of NAD, the substrate on which PARP acts, in female NMRI mice with AAP hepatitis and evaluates the influence of simultaneous ethanol consumption in these animals. Liver injuries were quantified as serum activities of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT). While AAP caused a 117-fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet, which was significantly exacerbated by ethanol and inhibited by nicotinic acid amide (NAA), adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of NAD. In these animals, only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of AAP, and unlike the exacerbation caused by ethanol in mice on a standard diet, the liver damage was inhibited by 50% by ethanol. A further 64% reduction of hepatitis was observed, when NAA was given to ethanol/AAP-mice. Our results provide evidence that the AAP-induced hepatitis and its exacerbation by ethanol can either be reduced by end-product inhibition of PARP by NAA or by dietary depletion of the enzyme's substrate NAD. We see the main application of NAA as for the combinational use in pharmaceutical preparations of acetaminophen in order to avoid hepatic damage in patients treated with this widely used analgesic.

Reciprocal chromosome translocations are common de novo rearrangements that occur randomly throughout the human genome. To learn about causative mechanisms, we have cloned and sequenced the breakpoints of a cytologically balanced constitutional reciprocal translocation, t (X; 4) (p21. 2; q31. 22), present in a girl with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Physical mapping of the derivative chromosomes, after their separation in somatic cell hybrids, reveals that the translocation disrupts the DMD gene in Xp21 within the 18-kb intron 16. Restriction mapping and sequencing of clones that span both translocation breakpoints as well as the corresponding normal regions indicate the loss of approximately 5 kb in the formation of the derivative X chromosome, with 4-6 bp deleted from chromosome 4. RFLP and Southern analyses indicate that the de novo translocation is a paternal origin and that the fathers X chromosome contains the DNA that is deleted in the derivative X. Most likely, deletion and translation arose simultaneously from a complex rearrangement event that involves three chromosomal breakpoints. Short regions of sequence homology were present at the three sites. A 5-bp sequence, GGAAT, found exactly at the translocation breakpoints on both normal chromosomes X and 4, has been preserved only on the der (4) chromosome. It is likely that the X-derived sequence GGAATCA has been lost in the formation of the der (X) chromosome, as it matches an inverted GAATCA sequence present on the opposite strand exactly at the other end of the deleted 5-kb fragment.

Regular motor activity has many benefits for mental and physical condition but its implications for epilepsy are still controversial. In order to elucidate this problem, we have studied the effect of long-term physical activity on susceptibility to subsequent seizures. Male Wistar rats were subjected to repeated training sessions in a treadmill and swimming pool. Thereafter, seizures were induced by pilocarpine injections in trained and non-trained control groups. During the acute period of status epilepticus, we measured: (1) the latency of the first motor sign, (2) the intensity of seizures, (3) the time when it occurred within the 6-h observation period, and (4) the time when the acute period ended. All these behavioral parameters showed statistically significant changes suggesting that regular physical exercises decrease susceptibility to subsequently induced seizures and ameliorate the course of experimentally induced status epilepticus.

Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton may play a crucial role in cell motility and cancer invasion. We have produced a monoclonal antibody (NCC- Lu-632, IgM, k) reactive with an antigenic protein that is upregulated upon enhanced cell movement. The cDNA for the antigen molecule was found to encode a novel isoform of nonmuscle alpha-actinin. This isoform (designated actinin-4) was concentrated in the cytoplasm where cells were sharply extended and in cells migrating and located at the edge of cell clusters, but was absent from focal adhesion plaques or adherens junctions, where the classic isoform (actinin-1) was concentrated. Actinin-4 shifted steadily from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase or actin depolymerization. The cytoplasmic localization of actinin-4 was closely associated with an infiltrative histological phenotype and correlated significantly with a poorer prognosis in 61 cases of breast cancer. These findings suggest that cytoplasmic actinin-4 regulates the actin cytoskeleton and increases cellular motility and that its inactivation by transfer to the nucleus abolishes the metastatic potential of human cancers.

Renal Fanconi syndrome and myopathy after liver transplantation: drug-related mitochondrial cytopathy?
Renal failure developed after a prolonged course of vancomycin therapy in 2 patients who were receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as part of an antiretroviral regimen. Tenofovir has been implicated in the development of Fanconi syndrome and renal insufficiency because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule. Vancomycin nephrotoxicity is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a nephrotoxic agent. Clinicians should be aware that tenofovir may raise the risk of renal failure during prolonged administration of vancomycin.
Renal failure is a rare complication associated with the use of rifampin. Intravascular hemolysis leading to acute renal failure following rifampin therapy is extremely rare. Two patients with leprosy who developed hemolysis and acute renal failure following rifampin are reported.
Renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged isoflurane-induced hypotension in humans.
Renal papillary necrosis (RPN) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long-term treatment with aspirin and paracetamol in female Fischer 344 rats. Renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks, when no analgesics were given, to investigate whether the analgesic-induced changes were reversible. There was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix, or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment. The recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage. During the early stages of analgesic treatment, the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible, but after prolonged analgesic treatment, maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover. This study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in Fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to RPN. The associated urinary concentrating defect is reversible only during the early stages of structural damage to the inner medulla.
Renal papillary necrosis due to naproxen.
Renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD) is a developmental abnormality of the renal proximal tubules found in patients with Potter syndrome. We report a female newborn with RTD who has survived for more than 18 months. Infusions of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the early neonatal period were effective in raising and maintaining her blood pressure. Peritoneal dialysis was required until the appearance of spontaneous urination at 29 days after birth. Histopathological examinations of the kidney revealed dilated renal tubular lumina and foamy columnar epithelial cells in the renal tubules. Endocrinological studies showed a discrepancy between low plasma renin activity (<0.1 ng/ml/hr) and high active renin concentration (135,000 pg/ml), suggesting an aberration in the renin substrate, angiotensinogen. Direct sequencing analysis revealed two novel mutations in the coding region of the angiotensinogen gene (AGT): a nonsense mutation in exon 2 (c.604C > T) and a frameshift deletion at nucleotide 1290 in exon 5 (c.1290delT). The mutations were in the compound heterozygous state, because each parent had each mutation. These findings suggest that angiotensinogen deficiency is one of the causes of RTD. A treatment of the condition with FFP may help to promote long survival.
Repeat expansion has been implicated in 10 out of 17 candidate genes identified for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs)-commonly referred as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Though genetically distinct, the SCAs share a large number of features that confound their clinical classification. In addition, there is a difference in the prevalence and phenotypic expression of ataxias between different ethnic groups. We have created a new SCA-locus-specific variation database (LSVD) that aims to catalog and integrate information on SCAs associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion (SCA1, SCA 2, SCA 3, SCA 6, SCA 7, SCA 8, SCA 12, SCA 17, Friedreich's ataxia [FRDA], and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA]) from all over the world. The database has been developed using the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) software (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands). The database houses detailed information on clinical features, such as age and symptom at onset, mode of inheritance, and genotype information, pertaining to the SCA patients from more than 400 families across India. All the compiled genotype data conforms to the HGVS Nomenclature guidelines. This would be a very useful starting point for understanding the molecular correlates of phenotypes in ataxia-a multilocus disease in which related molecular mechanisms converge to overlapping phenotypes.

Reperfusion of ischemic intestine results in acute liver dysfunction characterized by hepatocellular enzyme release into plasma, reduction in bile flow rate, and neutrophil sequestration within the liver. The pathophysiology underlying this acute hepatic injury is unknown. This study was undertaken to determine whether oxidants are associated with the hepatic injury and to determine the relative value of several indirect methods of assessing oxidant exposure in vivo. Rats were subjected to a standardized intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Hepatic tissue was assayed for lipid peroxidation products and oxidized and reduced glutathione. There was no change in hepatic tissue total glutathione following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) increased significantly following 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. There was no increase in any of the products of lipid peroxidation associated with this injury. An increase in GSSG within hepatic tissue during intestinal reperfusion suggests exposure of hepatocytes to an oxidant stress. The lack of a significant increase in products of lipid peroxidation suggests that the oxidant stress is of insufficient magnitude to result in irreversible injury to hepatocyte cell membranes. These data also suggest that the measurement of tissue GSSG may be a more sensitive indicator of oxidant stress than measurement of products of lipid peroxidation.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.
Replication factor C (RFC) is a multisubunit, DNA polymerase accessory protein required for the coordinated synthesis of both DNA strands during simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro. Previous studies have shown that RFC is a DNA-dependent ATPase that binds in a structure-specific manner to the 3' end of a primer hybridized to a template DNA, an activity thought intrinsic to the 140-kDa component of this multisubunit complex. Here, the isolation and analysis of cDNAs encoding this subunit is described. Analysis of the full-length coding sequence revealed an open reading frame of 3.4 kb, encoding an 1148-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 130 kDa. A putative ATP-binding motif was observed that is similar to a motif in several of the smaller subunits of RFC and in functionally homologous replication factors of bacterial and viral origin. A " DEAD " box is also conserved among these proteins. The predicted protein shows significant identity with a DNA-binding protein of murine origin (B. Luckow, P. Lichter, and G. SchÃ¼tz, personal communication). Regions of similarity were also seen between the amino acid sequences of the 140-kDa subunit of RFC, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and bacterial DNA ligases--possibly representing a conserved structural feature of these proteins that bind similar DNA substrates.

Reserpine- and haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia are putative animal models of tardive dyskinesia (TD) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress. In the present study, the authors induced orofacial dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rats. Reserpine injection (one dose of 1 mg/kg s.c.) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching, compared to the control. Haloperidol administration (one dose of 12 mg/kg once a week s.c.) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations. After the treatments and behavioral observation, glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed. A decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol, compared to the control. Importantly, a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial diskinesia. These results indicate that early changes in glutamate transport may be related to the development of vacuous chewing movements in rats.

Retention of resident proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum is achieved in both yeast and animal cells by their continual retrieval from the cis-Golgi, or a pre-Golgi compartment. Sorting of these proteins is dependent on a C-terminal tetrapeptide signal, usually Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL in the single letter code) in animal cells, His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. There is evidence that the ERD2 gene encodes the sorting receptor that recognizes HDEL in yeast; its product is an integral membrane protein of relative molecular mass 26,000 (26K) that is not glycosylated. In contrast, Vaux et al. suggest that the mammalian KDEL receptor is a 72K glycoprotein that they detected using an anti-idiotypic antibody approach. If this were so, it would indicate a surprising divergence of the retrieval machinery between yeast and animal cells. We report here that human cells express a protein similar in sequence, size and properties to the ERD2 product, and propose that this protein is the human KDEL receptor.
Retinoblastoma is a childhood tumor that can arise because of mutant alleles acquired as somatic or germinal mutations. The mutant allele can be carried in the germ line. The mutations creating these alleles act by inactivating copies of a recessive oncogene located within band q14 of chromosome 13 and termed the RB1 locus. We have reported isolation of a cDNA fragment that recognizes chromosomal sequences possessing many of the attributes of the retinoblastoma gene associated with the RB1 locus. We now report that this segment is additionally the target of somatic mutations in mesenchymal tumors among patients having no apparent predisposition to retinoblastoma and no previous evidence of retinoblastoma. These tumors provide additional evidence that the cloned sequences are representative of a gene that is a frequent target of inactivation during tumorigenesis. Sequence analysis of this cDNA provides little insight into its normal functional role..
Retinoid-induced proliferation causing hyperleukocytosis is a severe complication of retinoid therapy in t(15;17) acute promyelocytic leukaemia. The molecular basis of this phenomenon is unknown. It is possible that the transiently enhanced cell proliferation results from RA-induction of growth regulatory genes. Using Differential Display of cDNAs from NB4 cells we have identified Jem, a novel gene transcript which is upregulated by retinoids during the early proliferative response in maturating cells but not in resistant cells. A 2.7 kb cDNA was cloned and sequenced. The open reading frame contains a 400 amino acid sequence corresponding to a novel 45 kDa basic protein (pI 8.9). The JEM DNA sequence is detected by FISH on human chromosome 1 at q24. The Jem peptide sequence shows a 'leucine-zipper' dimerisation motif with limited homology to Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB proteins and several putative phosphorylation sites. An atypical basic region may correspond to an unknown DNA-binding domain. The C-terminal end of Jem spans a long stretch featuring a PEST motif. After transfection into COS cells, the Jem protein shows a ponctuated nuclear localisation. We hypothesise that this novel nuclear factor may act as a transcription factor, or a coregulator, involved in either cell growth control and/or maturation.

Reversible valproic acid-induced dementia was documented in a 21-year-old man with epilepsy who had a 3-year history of insidious progressive decline in global cognitive abilities documented by serial neuropsychological studies. Repeat neuropsychological testing 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug revealed dramatic improvement in IQ, memory, naming, and other tasks commensurate with clinical recovery in his intellectual capacity. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms which may have been operative in this case include: a direct central nervous system (CNS) toxic effect of valproic acid; a paradoxical epileptogenic effect secondary to the drug; and an indirect CNS toxic effect mediated through valproic acid-induced hyperammonemia.

Rg1, as a ginsenoside extracted from Panax ginseng, could ameliorate spatial learning impairment. Previous studies have demonstrated that Rg1 might be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of morphine. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Rg1 on learning impairment by chronic morphine administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect. Male rats were subcutaneously injected with morphine (10 mg/kg) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days, and Rg1 (30 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of morphine once a day for 10 days. Spatial learning capacity was assessed in the Morris water maze. The results showed that rats treated with Morphine/Rg1 decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency. By implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo, the results showed that Rg1 restored the long-term potentiation (LTP) impaired by morphine in both freely moving and anaesthetised rats. The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that Rg1 restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with morphine, but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline- or morphine/Rg1-treated rats; this restoration could be inhibited by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK801. We conclude that Rg1 may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by chonic morphine administration and restore the morphine-inhibited LTP. This effect is NMDA receptor dependent.

Risperidone is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. Previous clinical studies have proposed that risperidone's pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative psychotic symptoms and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects; features shared by so-called 'atypical' neuroleptics. To determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects, we used [123I]IBZM SPECT to determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone (n = 12) or haloperidol (n = 7). Both risperidone and haloperidol produced D2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90% at standard clinical doses. There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with haloperidol or risperidone. Drug-induced parkinsonism was observed in subjects treated with risperidone (42%) and haloperidol (29%) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60%. Based on these observations, it is concluded that 5-HT2 blockade obtained with risperidone at D2 occupancy rates of 60% and above does not appear to protect against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects.

Rizatriptan is a selective 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist with rapid oral absorption and early onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine. This randomized double- blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1 rizatriptan 10 mg tablet to 2 ergotamine 1 mg/caffeine 100 mg tablets in 439 patients treating a single migraine attack with each therapy. Of patients expressing a preference (89.1%), more than twice as many preferred rizatriptan to ergotamine/caffeine (69.9 vs. 30.1%, p < or = 0.001). Faster relief of headache was the most important reason for preference, cited by 67.3% of patients preferring rizatriptan and 54.2% of patients who preferred ergotamine/caffeine. The co-primary endpoint of being pain free at 2 h was also in favor of rizatriptan. Forty-nine percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan, compared with 24.3% treated with ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001), rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment. Headache relief at 2 h was 75.9% for rizatriptan and 47.3% for ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001), with rizatriptan being superior to ergotamine/caffeine within 30 min of dosing. Almost 36% of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h, compared to 20% of patients on ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001). Rizatriptan was also superior to ergotamine/caffeine in the proportions of patients with no nausea, vomiting, phonophobia or photophobia and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake (p < or = 0.001). More patients were (completely, very or somewhat) satisfied 2 h after treatment with rizatriptan (69.8%) than at 2 h after treatment with ergotamine/caffeine (38.6%, p < or = 0.001). Recurrence rates were 31.4% with rizatriptan and 15.3% with ergotamine/caffeine. Both active treatments were well tolerated. The most common adverse events (incidence > or = 5% in one group) after rizatriptan and ergotamine/caffeine, respectively, were dizziness (6.7 and 5.3%), nausea (4.2 and 8.5%) and somnolence (5.5 and 2.3%).

Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is a well-characterized genetic syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of CBP in a majority of individuals. In 10% of cases a microdeletion in 16p13.3 affecting CBP is detected. We report on a patient with a de novo 345-480 kb micro-duplication the region, encompassing only CBP and TRAP1. This boy presented with various minor physical anomalies, moderate mental retardation, and an atrial septal defect, but none of the other typical characteristics of the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, such as the broad thumbs and first toes or facial characteristics. This finding implicates CBP as one of the causative genes for the trisomy 16p13 syndrome, and indicates this is a contiguous gene syndrome.
S-312, S-312-d, but not S-312-l, L-type calcium channel antagonists, showed anticonvulsant effects on the audiogenic tonic convulsions in DBA/2 mice; and their ED50 values were 18.4 (12.8-27.1) mg/kg, p.o. and 15.0 (10.2-23.7) mg/kg, p.o., respectively, while that of flunarizine was 34.0 (26.0-44.8) mg/kg, p.o. Although moderate anticonvulsant effects of S-312-d in higher doses were observed against the clonic convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazole (85 mg/kg, s.c.) or bemegride (40 mg/kg, s.c.), no effects were observed in convulsions induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate, picrotoxin, or electroshock in Slc:ddY mice. S-312-d may be useful in the therapy of certain types of human epilepsy.

SCA-LSVD: a repeat-oriented locus-specific variation database for genotype to phenotype correlations in spinocerebellar ataxias.
SCA3, the gene for spinal cerebellar ataxia 3, was recently mapped to a 15-cM interval between D14S67 and D14S81 on chromosome 14q, by linkage analysis in two families of French ancestry. The SCA3 candidate region has now been refined by linkage analysis with four new microsatellite markers (D14S256, D14S291, D14S280, and AFM343vf1) in the same two families, in which 19 additional individuals were genotyped, and in a third French family. Combined two-point linkage analyses show that the new markers, D14S280 and AFM343vf1, are tightly linked to the SCA3 locus, with maximal lod scores, at recombination fraction, (theta) =. 00, of 7. 05 and 13. 70, respectively. Combined multipoint and recombinant haplotype analyses localize the SCA3 locus to a 3-cM interval flanked by D14S291 and D14S81. The same allele for D14S280 segregates with the disease locus in the three kindreds. This allele is frequent in the French population, however, and linkage disequilibrium is not clearly established. The SCA3 locus remains within the 29-cM region on 14q24. 3-q32. 2 containing the gene for the Machado-Joseph disease, which is clinically related to the phenotype determined by SCA3, but it cannot yet be concluded that both diseases result from alterations of the same gene

SOX (SRY box-containing) genes share a particular DNA-binding domain, called HMG, with the mammalian testis-determining gene SRY Several SOX genes have already been shown to be transcription factors involved in the decision of important cell fates during development. Here we report the cloning of a new human member of the SOX gene family, SOX22. The corresponding protein contains several domains that are also present in other paralogous SOX proteins. The SOX22 gene maps to chromosome 20 on band p13 and does not appear to be clustered with any other SOX gene mapped to date. SOX22 mRNA is expressed in various fetal and adult organs and tissues, suggesting that this gene plays roles in both differentiation and maintenance of several cell types.
SOX proteins form a large family of transcription factors related by a DNA-binding domain known as the HMG box. Some 30 Sox genes have been identified in mammals and orthologues have been found in a wide range of other metazoans. Sox genes are highly conserved and are known to play important roles in embryonic development, including roles in gonadal, central nervous system, neural crest and skeletal development. Several SOX genes have been implicated in human congenital diseases. We report here the isolation of Sox8 and its characterisation in mice and humans. This gene has a remarkably similar primary structure and genomic organisation to the campomelic dysplasia gene SOX9 and the Waardenburg-Shah syndrome gene SOX10. SOX8 protein is able to bind to canonical SOX target DNA sequences and activate transcription in vitro through two separate trans -activation regions. Further, Sox8 is expressed in the central nervous system, limbs, kidneys, gonads and craniofacial structures during mouse embryo development. Sox8 maps to the t complex on mouse chromosome 17 and to human chromosome 16p13.3, a region associated with the microphthalmia-cataract syndrome CATM and the alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome ATR-16.
SOX22 is a new member of the SOX gene family, mainly expressed in human nervous tissue.
STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may unmask seizures in mixed cocaine-benzodiazepine intoxication. DESIGN: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received 100 mg/kg cocaine IP alone, 5 mg/kg diazepam alone, or a combination of diazepam and cocaine. Three minutes later, groups were challenged with vehicle or flumazenil 5 or 10 mg/kg IP. Animal behavior, seizures (time to and incidence), death (time to and incidence), and cortical EEG tracings were recorded. INTERVENTIONS: Administration of flumazenil to animals after they had received a combination dose of cocaine and diazepam. RESULTS: In group 1, animals received cocaine followed by vehicle. This resulted in 100% developing seizures and death. Group 2 received diazepam alone followed by vehicle. Animals became somnolent and none died. Group 3 received diazepam followed by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. Animals became somnolent after diazepam and then active after flumazenil administration. In group 4, a combination of cocaine and diazepam was administered simultaneously. This resulted in no overt or EEG-detectable seizures and a 50% incidence of death. Group 5 received a similar combination of cocaine and diazepam, followed later by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. This resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < .01), and death, 100% (P < or = .01), compared with group 4. Group 6 received cocaine and diazepam followed by 10 mg/kg flumazenil. This also resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < or = .01), and death, 90% (P < or = .05), compared with group 4. CONCLUSION: Flumazenil can unmask seizures and increase the incidence of death in a model of combined cocaine-diazepam intoxications.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: Chest pain in the setting of cocaine use poses a diagnostic dilemma. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a widely available and sensitive test for evaluating cardiac ischemia. Because of the theoretical concern regarding administration of dobutamine in the setting of cocaine use, we conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of DSE in emergency department patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. METHODS: A prospective case series was conducted in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit in the ED of an urban tertiary-care teaching hospital. Patients were eligible for DSE if they had used cocaine within 24 hours preceding the onset of chest pain and had a normal ECG and tropinin I level. Patients exhibiting signs of continuing cocaine toxicity were excluded from the study. All patients were admitted to the hospital for serial testing after the DSE testing in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Two patients had inadequate resting images, one DSE was terminated because of inferior hypokinesis, another DSE was terminated because of a rate-related atrial conduction deficit, and 1 patient did not reach the target heart rate. Thus, 19 patients completed a DSE and reached their target heart rates. None of the patients experienced signs of exaggerated adrenergic response, which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of greater than 200 mm Hg or the occurrence of tachydysrhythmias (excluding sinus tachycardia). Further suggesting lack of exaggerated adrenergic response, 13 (65%) of 20 patients required supplemental atropine to reach their target heart rates. CONCLUSION: No exaggerated adrenergic response was detected when dobutamine was administered to patients with cocaine-related chest pain.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the effect of pretreatment with remifentanil 1 microg/kg and the effect of gender on the incidence of myoclonus after anesthesia induction with etomidate. DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind study. SETTING: The study was conducted at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty patients were pretreated in a randomized double-blinded fashion with remifentanil 1 microg/kg or placebo. Two minutes after remifentanil or placebo injection, etomidate 0.3 mg/kg was given. MEASUREMENTS: Myoclonus was recorded with a scale of 0 to 3. The grade of sedation (none, mild, moderate, severe), nausea, pruritus, and apnea were recorded after injection of both drugs. MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of myoclonus was significantly lower in the remifentanil group (6.7%) than in the placebo group (70%) (P < 0.001). None of the patients experienced sedation, apnea, nausea, or pruritus after injection of both drugs. In the placebo group, male patients were associated with significantly increased incidence of myoclonus after etomidate administration. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with remifentanil 1 microg/kg reduced myoclonus after etomidate induction without side effects such as sedation, apnea, nausea, or pruritus. Men experience increased incidence of myoclonus than women after etomidate administration.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of metoprolol on dobutamine stress testing with technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography imaging and ST-segment monitoring, and to assess the impact of intravenous glucagon on metoprolol's effects. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Community hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with known reversible perfusion defects. INTERVENTION: Patients underwent dobutamine stress tests per standard protocol. Before dobutamine was begun, no therapy was given during the first visit, and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive metoprolol or metoprolol plus glucagon 1 mg. Metoprolol was dosed to achieve a resting predobutamine heart rate below 65 beats/minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Metoprolol reduced maximum heart rate 31%, summed stress scores 29%, and summed difference scores 43% versus control. Metoprolol plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29% versus control. Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced, although they were 18% and 30% lower, respectively, than control. No significant differences were found in any parameter between metoprolol and metoprolol-glucagon. CONCLUSION: During dobutamine stress testing, metoprolol attenuates or eliminates evidence of myocardial ischemia. Glucagon 1 mg, although somewhat effective, does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer who were treated with docetaxel alone or in combination with thalidomide. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a randomized phase II trial. SETTING: National Institutes of Health clinical research center. PATIENTS: Seventy men, aged 50-80 years, with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer. INTERVENTION: Each patient received either intravenous docetaxel 30 mg/m2/week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by 1 week off, or the combination of continuous oral thalidomide 200 mg every evening plus the same docetaxel regimen. This 4-week cycle was repeated until there was evidence of excessive toxicity or disease progression. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: None of 23 patients who received docetaxel alone developed VTE, whereas 9 of 47 patients (19%) who received docetaxel plus thalidomide developed VTE (p=0.025). CONCLUSION: The addition of thalidomide to docetaxel in the treatment of prostate cancer significantly increases the frequency of VTE. Clinicians should be aware of this potential complication when adding thalidomide to chemotherapeutic regimens.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of lidocaine in the setting of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction (MI). DESIGN: A retrospective, multicenter study. SETTING: Twenty-nine university, university-affiliated, or community hospitals during a 6-year period (total of 117 cumulative hospital-years). PARTICIPANTS: Patients with cocaine-associated MI who received lidocaine in the emergency department. RESULTS: Of 29 patients who received lidocaine in the setting of cocaine-associated MI, no patient died; exhibited bradydysrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation; or experienced seizures after administration of lidocaine (95% confidence interval, 0% to 11%). CONCLUSION: Despite theoretical concerns that lidocaine may enhance cocaine toxicity, the use of lidocaine in patients with cocaine-associated MI was not associated with significant cardiovascular or central nervous system toxicity.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the rate of akathisia after administration of intravenous prochlorperazine as a 2-minute bolus or 15-minute infusion. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind study in the emergency department of a central-city teaching hospital. Patients aged 18 years or older treated with prochlorperazine for headache, nausea, or vomiting were eligible for inclusion. Study participants were randomized to receive 10 mg of prochlorperazine administered intravenously by means of 2-minute push (bolus group) or 10 mg diluted in 50 mL of normal saline solution administered by means of intravenous infusion during a 15-minute period (infusion group). The main outcome was the number of study participants experiencing akathisia within 60 minutes of administration. Akathisia was defined as either a spontaneous report of restlessness or agitation or a change of 2 or more in the patient-reported akathisia rating scale and a change of at least 1 in the investigator-observed akathisia rating scale. The intensity of headache and nausea was measured with a 100-mm visual analog scale. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled. One study participant was excluded after protocol violation. Seventy-three percent (73/99) of the study participants were treated for headache and 70% (70/99) for nausea. In the bolus group, 26.0% (13/50) had akathisia compared with 32.7% (16/49) in the infusion group (Delta=-6.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -24.6% to 11.2%). The difference between the bolus and infusion groups in the percentage of participants who saw a 50% reduction in their headache intensity within 30 minutes was 11.8% (95% CI -9.6% to 33.3%). The difference in the percentage of patients with a 50% reduction in their nausea was 12.6% (95% CI -4.6% to 29.8%). CONCLUSION: A 50% reduction in the incidence of akathisia when prochlorperazine was administered by means of 15-minute intravenous infusion versus a 2-minute intravenous push was not detected. The efficacy of prochlorperazine in the treatment of headache and nausea likewise did not appear to be affected by the rate of administration, although no formal statistical comparisons were made.
SUMOs are small ubiquitin-related polypeptides that are reversibly conjugated to many nuclear proteins. Although the number of identified substrates has grown rapidly, relatively little is still understood about when, where, and why most proteins are modified by SUMO. Here, we demonstrate that enzymes involved in the SUMO modification and demodification of proteins are components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We show that SENP2, a SUMO protease that is able to demodify both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 protein conjugates, localizes to the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC. The unique amino-terminal domain of SENP2 interacts with the FG repeat domain of Nup153, indicating that SENP2 associates with the nucleoplasmic basket of the NPC. We also investigated the localization of the SUMO conjugating enzyme, Ubc9. Using immunogold labeling of isolated nuclear envelopes, we found that Ubc9 localizes to both the cytoplasmic and the nucleoplasmic filaments of the NPC. In vitro binding studies revealed that Ubc9 and SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1 bind synergistically to form a trimeric complex with a component of the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC, Nup358. Our results indicate that both SUMO modification and demodification of proteins may occur at the NPC and suggest a connection between the SUMO modification pathway and nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission. However, the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor produce schizophrenic-like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor. As a result, there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor. Among them are glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors such as SSR103800, which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine (a co-agonist for the NMDA receptor) levels in the synapse. This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of SSR103800, with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity, involving either drug challenge (ie, amphetamine and MK-801) or transgenic mice (ie, NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) and DAT(-/-)). Results showed that SSR103800 (10-30 mg/kg p.o.) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) mice. In contrast, SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter (DAT(-/-)) knockout mice (10-30 mg/kg p.o.). Importantly, both classical (haloperidol) and atypical (olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity. However, unlike these latter, SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy (retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg/kg p.o. Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor, SSR103800, produces antipsychotic-like effects, which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system, and has a reduced side-effect potential as compared with these latter drugs.
Schizophrenia is clinically heterogeneous and multidimensional, but it is not known whether this is due to etiological heterogeneity. Previous studies have not consistently reported association between any specific polymorphisms and clinical features of schizophrenia, and have primarily used case-control designs. We tested for the presence of association between clinical features and polymorphisms in the genes for the serotonin 2A receptor (HT2A), dopamine receptor types 2 and 4, dopamine transporter (SLC6A3), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Two hundred seventy pedigrees were ascertained on the basis of having two or more members with schizophrenia or poor outcome schizoaffective disorder. Diagnoses were made using a structured interview based on the SCID. All patients were rated on the major symptoms of schizophrenia scale (MSSS), integrating clinical and course features throughout the course of illness. Factor analysis revealed positive, negative, and affective symptom factors. The program QTDT was used to implement a family-based test of association for quantitative traits, controlling for age and sex. We found suggestive evidence of association between the His452Tyr polymorphism in HT2A and affective symptoms (P = 0.02), the 172-bp allele of BDNF and negative symptoms (P = 0.04), and the 480-bp allele in SLC6A3 (= DAT1) and negative symptoms (P = 0.04). As total of 19 alleles were tested, we cannot rule out false positives. However, given prior evidence of involvement of the proteins encoded by these genes in psychopathology, our results suggest that more attention should be focused on the impact of these alleles on clinical features of schizophrenia.
Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 2 and Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome: a case for "lumping".
Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a rare complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc) but can be severe enough to require temporary or permanent renal replacement therapy. Moderate to high dose corticosteroid use is recognized as a major risk factor for SRC. Furthermore, there have been reports of thrombotic microangiopathy precipitated by cyclosporine in patients with SSc.

Screening for the G6PD deficiency was carried out at the Maternity Division of the Galliera Hospital in Genoa, Italy. Two groups of subjects with hyperbilirubinaemia of non-immunological origin were examined (a) 302 newborn babies of Sardinian extraction (on cord blood) and (b) 201 newborn babies of south Italian ancestry (on peripheral blood). Among 503 subjects, 43 showed an enzyme deficiency; in 39 the defect was of the Mediterranean type. In one case, previously described, the enzyme was of the A- type. In the remaining cases three different variants were identified. In the present work these three cases, each with severe neonatal jaundice, are reported. Their parents originated from Calabria, from Sardinia and from Sicily. The abnormal enzymes are respectively designated as GdDcbrousse-like, GdGallura and GdAgrigento..
Second- and third-generation cephalosporins, especially cefotetan, are increasingly associated with severe, sometimes fatal immune hemolytic anemia. We noticed that 10 of our 35 cases of cefotetan-induced hemolytic anemias were in patients who had received cefotetan prophylactically for obstetric and gynecologic procedures. Eight of these cases of severe immune hemolytic anemia are described.
Sedation depth during spinal anesthesia and the development of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture repair.
Sedation has been commonly used in the neonate to decrease the stress and pain from the noxious stimuli and invasive procedures in the neonatal intensive care unit, as well as to facilitate synchrony between ventilator and spontaneous breaths. Fentanyl, an opioid analgesic, is frequently used in the neonatal intensive care unit setting for these very purposes. Various reported side effects of fentanyl administration include chest wall rigidity, hypotension, respiratory depression, and bradycardia. Here, 2 cases of urinary bladder retention leading to renal pelvocalyceal dilatation mimicking hydronephrosis as a result of continuous infusion of fentanyl are reported.
Segmental necrotising glomerulonephritis has been reported as complication of rifampicin therapy in patients receiving treatment for tuberculosis. Changing epidemiology of infections such as infective endocarditis (IE) has led to an increase in the use of rifampicin for Staphylococcal infections. We describe a case of a patient with Staphylococcal IE who developed acute renal failure secondary to a segmental necrotising glomerulonephritis while being treated with rifampicin, and review the literature regarding this complication of rifampicin therapy.
Segregation analysis of a marker localised Xp21.2-Xp21.3 in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy families.
Segregation data on LW in families of informative males show that the LW (Landsteiner-Wiener) blood group locus is closely linked to the complement C3 locus and to the locus for the Lutheran blood group. This finding also confirms the presence of a larger linkage group on chromosome 19, including now the loci for apoE, Le, C3, LW, Lu, Se, H, PEPD, myotonic dystrophy (DM), neurofibromatosis (NF) and familial hypercholesterolemia (FHC). Linkage of LW with the Lewis blood group locus could not be definitely established by the present family data, but small positive scores between LW and Le suggest that the Le locus is situated outside the C3-LW region.
Segregation distortion has been reported to occur in a number of the trinucleotide repeat disorders. On the basis of a sperm typing study performed in patients of Japanese descent with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), it was reported that disease alleles are preferentially transmitted during meiosis. We performed a sperm typing study of five MJD patients of French descent and analysis of the pooled data shows a ratio of mutant to normal alleles of 379 436 (46. 5 53. 5%), which does not support meiotic segregation distortion. To confirm these results, sperm typing analysis was also performed using a polymorphic marker, D14S1050, closely linked to the MJD1 gene. Among 910 sperm analyzed, the allele linked to the disease chromosome was detected in 50. 3% of the samples and the allele linked to the normal chromosome was found in 49. 6% of the sperm. The difference in frequency of these two alleles is not significant (P = 0. 8423). Likelihood-based analysis of segregation distortion in the single sperm data using the SPERMSEG program also showed no support for segregation distortion at the gamete level in this patient population. The previous report on the Japanese patients also suggested that disease allele stability may be influenced by a trans effect of an intragenic polymorphism (987 G/C) in the wild-type allele. All of the French patients were heterozygous for this polymorphism. However, analysis of the variance in repeat number in sperm from the French MJD patients overlapped significantly with the variance in repeat number observed in the C/C homozygous Japanese patients.

Seizure susceptibility varies among inbred mouse strains. Chromosome substitution strains (CSS), in which a single chromosome from one inbred strain (donor) has been transferred onto a second strain (host) by repeated backcrossing, may be used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contribute to seizure susceptibility. QTLs for susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy, have not been reported, and CSS have not previously been used to localize seizure susceptibility genes. We report QTLs identified using a B6 (host) x A/J (donor) CSS panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures. Three hundred fifty-five adult male CSS mice, 58 B6, and 39 A/J were tested for susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures. Highest stage reached and latency to each stage were recorded for all mice. B6 mice were resistant to seizures and slower to reach stages compared to A/J mice. The CSS for Chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe stages, diverging dramatically from the B6 phenotype. Latencies to stages were also significantly shorter for CSS10 and CSS18 mice. CSS mapping suggests seizure susceptibility loci on mouse Chromosomes 10 and 18. This approach provides a framework for identifying potentially novel homologous candidate genes for human temporal lobe epilepsy.

Semaphorins were initially described as a family of repulsive guidance molecules in embryonal development. Their basic structure consists of an N-terminal signal sequence, the defining semaphorin domain ofapproximately 500 amino acids, an Ig-like domain,and a variable carboxy-terminus. We recently described a viral semaphorin homologue encoded by the alcelaphine herpesvirus type 1. Less conserved, truncated homologues were also identified in poxviruses. Here we describe new human and murine semaphorin homologues. The respective genes were cloned and sequenced, and they were termed H-Sema-L and M-Sema-L (HGMW-approved symbols SEMAL and Semal, respectively). A multiply spliced mRNA of 3.2 kb is expressed in human placenta, spleen, thymus, and gonadal tissue. H-Sema-L maps to chromosome 15q22.3-q23 and M-Sema-L to the homologous locus 9A3.3-B in the mouse genome. The expression patterns and the presence of related genes in large DNA viruses suggest that this new semaphorin has a relevant function in the immune system. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

Sequential cleavage of the precursor protein pre-pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) generates the melanocortin peptides adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH) alpha, beta and gamma as well as the opioid-receptor ligand beta-endorphin. While a few cases of isolated ACTH deficiency have been reported (OMIM 201400), an inherited POMC defect has not been described so far. Recent studies in animal models elucidated a central role of alpha-MSH in the regulation of food intake by activation of the brain melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4-R; refs 3-5) and the linkage of human obesity to chromosome 2 in close proximity to the POMC locus, led to the proposal of an association of POMC with human obesity. The dual role of alpha-MSH in regulating food intake and influencing hair pigmentation predicts that the phenotype associated with a defect in POMC function would include obesity, alteration in pigmentation and ACTH deficiency. The observation of these symptoms in two probands prompted us to search for mutations within their POMC genes. Patient 1 was found to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations in exon 3 (G7013T, C7133delta) which interfere with appropriate synthesis of ACTH and alpha-MSH. Patient 2 was homozygous for a mutation in exon 2 (C3804A) which abolishes POMC translation. These findings represent the first examples of a genetic defect within the POMC gene and define a new monogenic endocrine disorder resulting in early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation..
Sequential measurement of QT interval during left ventricular angiography was made 30 seconds and one, three, five and ten minutes after injection of hypaque 76. The subjects were ten patients found to have normal left ventricles and coronary arteries. Significant QTC prolongation occurred in 30 seconds to one minute in association with marked hypotension and elevation of cardiac output.

Seven cases of procainamide-induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia are presented. In four patients, polymorphous ventricular tachycardia appeared after intravenous administration of 200 to 400 mg of procainamide for the treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia. In the remaining three patients, procainamide was administered orally for treatment of chronic premature ventricular contractions or atrial flutter. These patients had Q-T prolongation and recurrent syncope due to polymorphous ventricular tachycardia. In four patients, the arrhythmia was rapidly diagnosed and treated with disappearance of further episodes of the arrhythmia. In two patients, the arrhythmia degenerated into irreversible ventricular fibrillation and both patients died. In the seventh patient, a permanent ventricular pacemaker was inserted and, despite continuation of procainamide therapy, polymorphous ventricular tachycardia did not reoccur. These seven cases demonstrate that procainamide can produce an acquired prolonged Q-T syndrome with polymorphous ventricular tachycardia.
Seven further molecular bases of C7 deficiency are described. All these new molecular defects involve single-nucleotide events, deletions and substitutions, some of which alter splice sites, and others codons. They are distributed along the C7 gene, but predominantly towards the 3 end. All were found in compound heterozygous individuals. The C6/C7 marker haplotypes associated with most C7 defects are tabulated..
Seven patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) with severely disabling dyskinesia received low-dose propranolol as an adjunct to the currently used medical treatment. There was a significant 40% improvement in the dyskinesia score without increase of parkinsonian motor disability. Ballistic and choreic dyskinesia were markedly ameliorated, whereas dystonia was not. This study suggests that administration of low doses of beta-blockers may improve levodopa-induced ballistic and choreic dyskinesia in PD.
Seventy families with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) known to the Institute of Child Health fall into three categories with respect to potential linkage analysis with the X chromosome DNA markers RC8 and L1. 28 that bridge the DMD gene. Families in which there is at least one obligatory female heterozygote (n = 13). Here prediction and exclusion of DMD gene transmission may be possible, the accuracy being dependent on the closeness of the linkage of the DNA marker (s) to the DMD gene; an illustrative case is reported. Families in which there is a single affected boy, who also has one or more healthy brothers (n = 26). Given an informative restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), the probability that the boy represents a new mutation can be reassessed; it is also possible to exclude the DMD gene in a sister. Families with a single affected boy with no brother (n = 30). Here exclusion of the DMD gene in a sister may be possible. Only in one family was there no possibility of useful linkage analysis. The linkage analysis required is described, and the need to check DMD families for informative RFLPs is stressed.
Several BRCA1 mutations have now been found to occur in geographically diverse breast and ovarian cancer families. To investigate mutation origin and mutation-specific phenotypes due to BRCA1, we constructed a haplotype of nine polymorphic markers within or immediately flanking the BRCA1 locus in a set of 61 breast/ovarian cancer families selected for having one of six recurrent BRCA1 mutations. Tests of both mutations and family-specific differences in age at diagnosis were not significant. A comparison of the six mutations in the relative proportions of cases of breast and ovarian cancer was suggestive of an effect (P =. 069), with 57% of women presumed affected because of the 1294 del 40 BRCA1 mutation having ovarian cancer, compared with 14% of affected women with the splice-site mutation in intron 5 of BRCA1. For the BRCA1 mutations studied here, the individual mutations are estimated to have arisen 9-170 generations ago. In general, a high degree of haplotype conservation across the region was observed, with haplotype differences most often due to mutations in the short-tandem-repeat markers, although some likely instances of recombination also were observed. For several of the instances, there was evidence for multiple, independent, BRCA1 mutational events.
Several cases of cardiac adverse reactions related to vinorelbine (VNR) have been reported in the literature. In order to quantify the incidence of these cardiac events, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing VNR with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various malignancies. Randomized clinical trials comparing VNR with other drugs in the treatment of cancer were searched in Medline, Embase, Evidence-based Medicine Reviews databases and the Cochrane library from 1987 to 2002. Outcomes of interest were severe cardiac events, toxic deaths and cardiac event-related deaths reported in each publication. We found 19 trials, involving 2441 patients treated by VNR and 2050 control patients. The incidence of cardiac events with VNR was 1.19% [95% confidence interval (CI) (0.75; 1.67)]. There was no difference in the risk of cardiac events between VNR and other drugs [odds ratio: 0.92, 95% CI (0.54; 1.55)]. The risk of VNR cardiac events was similar to vindesine (VDS) and other cardiotoxic drugs [fluorouracil, anthracyclines, gemcitabine (GEM) em leader ]. Even if it did not reach statistical significance because of a few number of cases, the risk was lower in trials excluding patients with cardiac history, and seemed to be higher in trials including patients with pre-existing cardiac diseases. Vinorelbine-related cardiac events concern about 1% of treated patients in clinical trials. However, the risk associated with VNR seems to be similar to that of other chemotherapeutic agents in the same indications.
Several cytopathic mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the dose-limiting cumulative and irreversible cardiomyopathy caused by doxorubicin. Recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors in the pathogenic process. The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties, protects against the cardiac and hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated with subchronic doxorubicin toxicity. Heart and liver mitochondria were isolated from rats treated for 7 weeks with doxorubicin (2 mg/kg sc/week), carvedilol (1 mg/kg ip/week), or the combination of the two drugs. Heart mitochondria isolated from doxorubicin-treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration (336 +/- 26 versus 425 +/- 53 natom O/min/mg protein) and a lower respiratory control ratio (RCR) (4.3 +/- 0.6 versus 5.8 +/- 0.4) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline-treated rats. Mitochondrial calcium-loading capacity and the activity of NADH-dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from doxorubicin-treated rats. Doxorubicin treatment also caused a decrease in RCR for liver mitochondria (3.9 +/- 0.9 versus 5.6 +/- 0.7 for control rats) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity. Coadministration of carvedilol decreased the extent of cellular vacuolization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and liver. Carvedilol also prevented the decrease in mitochondrial Ca(2+) loading capacity and the inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria caused by doxorubicin. Carvedilol by itself did not affect any of the parameters measured for heart or liver mitochondria. It is concluded that this protection by carvedilol against both the structural and functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage in minimizing the dose-limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy that accompanies long-term doxorubicin therapy in cancer patients.
Several lines of independent evidence suggest that human Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein 1 gene (NRAMP1) is an important regulator of susceptibility to infectious diseases caused by certain intracellular pathogens. Here, we report the nucleotide sequence of 32198 bp of genomic DNA overlapping NRAMP1 on chromosomal region 2q35. The NRAMP1 gene spans 13604 bp. The gene and its 5' genomic region are highly enriched for DNA repeat sequences. A second gene was identified in the immediate vicinity of NRAMP1 and was tentatively named Nuclear LIM Interactor-Interacting Factor (NLI-IF) by analogy to its closest ortholog. The human NLI-IF gene begins 4721 bp downstream of the NRAMP1 stop codon and is composed of seven exons varying in size from 57 bp to 1644 bp. The gene gives rise to a 2655-bp mRNA transcript that contains a 783-bp open reading frame. The predicted molecular weight of the 261-amino acid NLI-IF protein is 29.2 kDa. Several putative gene regulatory elements were identified in the 5' upstream region of NLI-IF, including consensus binding sequences for Sp1, AP-2, NF-kappa B, and PU 1. The NLI-IF amino acid sequence has homology to proteins that have a high degree of homology with the NLI-interacting factor from Gallus gallus and are found in divergent species ranging from yeast to plants. NLI-IF is part of a human gene family encoding four related proteins of unknown function. Northern blot analysis of 15 different human tissues revealed a 2.6-kb NLI-IF mRNA that was ubiquitously expressed, but at varying levels. A second transcript with estimated size of 7 kb was expressed only in the placenta. Our data provide new sequence information about the NRAMP1 gene region that will be useful in the search for genetic variants causally involved in altered susceptibility to infectious diseases.
Several structurally related metabolites of progesterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-20-ones) and deoxycorticosterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-21-diol-20-ones) and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against pilocarpine-, kainic acid- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizures in mice. Steroids with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine (416 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor seizures and status epilepticus (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.). The corresponding epimers with the 3-hydroxy group in the beta-position were also effective but less potent (ED50 values, 33.8-63.5, i.p.). Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against pilocarpine seizures, steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha-configuration had comparable or higher protective index values (TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection) than clonazepam, indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity. Steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha- or 5 beta,3 alpha-configurations also produced a dose-dependent delay in the onset of limbic seizures induced by kainic acid (32 mg/kg, s.c.), but did not completely protect against the seizures. However, when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the kainic acid-induced limbic seizures and status epilepticus was obtained. The steroids also caused a dose-dependent delay in NMDA (257 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced lethality, but did not completely protect against NMDA seizures or lethality. We conclude that neuroactive steroids are highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine- and kainic acid-induced seizures and status epilepticus in mice, and may be of utility in the treatment of some forms of status epilepticus in humans.
Several studies have suggested that the regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) may be a positional and functional candidate gene for schizophrenia. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located at the promoter region (SNP4 and SNP7) and the intron 1 (SNP18) of RGS4 have been verified in different ethnic groups. Positive results have been reported in these SNPs with different numbers of SNP combinatory haplotypes. In this study, these three SNP markers were genotyped in 218 schizophrenia pedigrees of Taiwan (864 individuals) for association analysis. Among these three SNPs, neither SNP4, SNP7, SNP18 has shown significant association with schizophrenia in single locus association analysis, nor any compositions of the three SNP haplotypes has shown significantly associations with the DSM-IV diagnosed schizophrenia. Our results fail to support the RGS4 as a candidate gene for schizophrenia when evaluated from these three SNP markers.
Several techniques have been developed to screen mismatch repair (MMR) genes for deleterious mutations. Until now, two different techniques were required to screen for both point mutations and large rearrangements. For the first time, we propose a new approach, called "quantitative PCR (qPCR) high-resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis (qPCR-HRM)," which combines qPCR and HRM to obtain a rapid and cost-effective method suitable for testing a large series of samples. We designed PCR amplicons to scan the MLH1 gene using qPCR HRM. Seventy-six patients were fully scanned in replicate, including 14 wild-type patients and 62 patients with known mutations (57 point mutations and five rearrangements). To validate the detected mutations, we used sequencing and/or hybridization on a dedicated MLH1 array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). All point mutations and rearrangements detected by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC)+multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were successfully detected by qPCR HRM. Three large rearrangements were characterized with the dedicated MLH1 array-CGH. One variant was detected with qPCR HRM in a wild-type patient and was located within the reverse primer. One variant was not detected with qPCR HRM or with dHPLC due to its proximity to a T-stretch. With qPCR HRM, prescreening for point mutations and large rearrangements are performed in one tube and in one step with a single machine, without the need for any automated sequencer in the prescreening process. In replicate, its reagent cost, sensitivity, and specificity are comparable to those of dHPLC+MLPA techniques. However, qPCR HRM outperformed the other techniques in terms of its rapidity and amount of data provided.

Severe nelarabine neurotoxicity in a patient who received concurrent intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is reported. A 37-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was admitted for relapsed disease. She was originally treated with induction chemotherapy followed by an autologous transplant. She developed relapsed disease 10 months later with leukemic involvement. She was re-induced with nelarabine 1500 mg/m(2) on days 1, 3, and 5 with 1 dose of IT cytarabine 100 mg on day 2 as central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. At the time of treatment, she was on continuous renal replacement therapy due to sequelae of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). She tolerated therapy well, entered a complete remission, and recovered her renal function. She received a second cycle of nelarabine without additional IT prophylaxis one month later. A week after this second cycle, she noted numbness in her lower extremities. Predominantly sensory, though also motor and autonomic, peripheral neuropathy started in her feet, ascended proximally to the mid-thoracic region, and eventually included her distal upper extremities. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her spine demonstrated changes from C2 to C6 consistent with subacute combined degeneration. Nelarabine was felt to be the cause of her symptoms. Her neuropathy stabilized and showed slight improvement and ultimately received an unrelated, reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant while in complete remission, but relapsed disease 10 weeks later. She is currently being treated with best supportive care. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of severe neurotoxicity caused by nelarabine in a patient who received concurrent IT chemotherapy.

Severe von Willebrand disease is characterized by undetectable or trace quantities of von Willebrand factor in plasma and tissue stores. We have studied the genomic DNA of 10 affected individuals from six families with this disorder using probes from the 5 and 3 ends of the vWF cDNA and with a probe extending from the 5 end into the central region. Southern blots of restriction endonuclease digests and gene dosage analysis measurements carried out with quantitative slot blots of undigested genomic DNA separated these patients into three groups. The first group consisted of a family with complete homozygous deletions of the vWF gene in the four probands. Gene dosage analysis was consistent with heterozygous deletions in both of the asymptomatic parents and four asymptomatic siblings of this kindred (P less than 0. 01). The second group was comprised of a family in which there was a complete heterozygous deletion of the vWF gene in the proband and one asymptomatic parent, suggesting that a different type of genetic abnormality was inherited from the other parent. Thus, the patient appeared to be doubly heterozygous for interacting genetic abnormalities affecting vWF expression. In the third group, no gene deletions could be detected. Alloantibodies developed only in the kindred with homozygous deletions. These techniques should prove useful in identifying carriers of severe von Willebrand disease and also in defining patients predictably at risk of developing alloantibodies to vWF.

Sialoadhesin is a macrophage-restricted cellular interaction molecule and a prototypic member of the Siglec family of sialic acid binding immunoglobulin (Ig)-like lectins. So far, it has only been characterized in rodents. Here, we report the molecular cloning, binding properties, and expression pattern of human sialoadhesin. The predicted protein sequences of human and mouse sialoadhesin are about 72% identical, with the greatest similarity in the extracellular region, which comprises 17 Ig domains in both species. A recombinant protein consisting of the first 4 N-terminal domains of human sialoadhesin fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 mediated sialic acid-dependent binding with a specificity similar to its mouse counterpart, preferring sialic acid in the alpha2,3 glycosidic linkage over the alpha2,6 linkage. By flow cytometry with peripheral blood leukocytes, recombinant sialoadhesin bound strongly to granulocytes with intermediate binding to monocytes, natural killer cells, B cells, and a subset of CD8 T cells. Using antibodies raised to the recombinant protein, sialoadhesin was immunoprecipitated from the THP-1 human monocytic cell line as an approximate 200-kd glycoprotein. The expression pattern of human sialoadhesin was found to be similar to that of the mouse receptor, being absent from monocytes and other peripheral blood leukocytes, but expressed strongly by tissue macrophages in the spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, liver, colon, and lungs. High expression was also found on inflammatory macrophages present in affected tissues from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Side effects of hysterosalpingography with Dimer-X, Hexabrix, Vasurix polyvidone and Endografine in 142 consecutive patients, receiving one of the four tested media were evaluated from replies to postal questionnaires. The Dimer-X group had a higher incidence of nausea and dizziness. The Endografine group had a higher incidence of abdominal pain. These differences occur especially in the age groups under 30 years. Hexabrix and Vasurix polyvidone are considered the best contrast media for hysterosalpingography and perhaps because of its low toxicity Hexabrix should be preferred.

Signaling through Notch receptors has been implicated in the control of cellular differentiation in animals ranging from nematodes to humans. Starting from a human expressed sequence tag-containing sequence resembling that of Serrate, the gene for a ligand of Drosophila melanogaster Notch, we assembled a full-length cDNA, now called human Jagged2, from overlapping cDNA clones. The full-length cDNA encodes a polypeptide having extensive sequence homology to Serrate (40.6% identity and 58.7% similarity) and even greater homology to several putative mammalian Notch ligands that have subsequently been described. When in situ hybridization was performed, expression of the murine Jagged2 homolog was found to be highest in fetal thymus, epidermis, foregut, dorsal root ganglia, and inner ear. In Northern blot analysis of RNA from tissues of 2-week-old mice, the 5.0-kb Jagged2 transcript was most abundant in heart, lung, thymus, skeletal muscle, brain, and testis. Immunohistochemistry revealed coexpression of Jagged2 and Notch1 within thymus and other fetal murine tissues, consistent with interaction of the two proteins in vivo. Coculture of fibroblasts expressing human Jagged2 with murine C2C12 myoblasts inhibited myogenic differentiation, accompanied by increased Notch1 and the appearance of a novel 115-kDa Notch1 fragment. Exposure of C2C12 cells to Jagged2 led to increased amounts of Notch mRNA as well as mRNAs for a second Notch receptor, Notch3, and a second Notch ligand, Jagged1. Constitutively active forms of Notchl in C2C12 cells also induced increased levels of the same set of mRNAs, suggesting positive feedback control of these genes initiated by binding of Jagged2 to Notch1. This feedback control may function in vivo to coordinate differentiation across certain groups of progenitor cells adopting identical cell fates.
Silencing of gene transcription involves local chromatin modification achieved through the local recruitment of large multiprotein complexes containing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. The mammalian corepressors mSin3A and mSin3B have been shown to play a key role in this process by tethering HDACs 1 and 2 to promoter-bound transcription factors. Similar mechanisms appear to be operative in yeast, in which epistasis experiments have established that the mSin3 and HDAC orthologs (SIN3 and RPD3), along with a novel protein, SDS3, function in the same repressor pathway. Here, we report the identification of a component of the mSin3-HDAC complex that bears homology to yeast SDS3, physically associates with mSin3 proteins in vivo, represses transcription in a manner that is partially dependent on HDAC activity, and enables HDAC1 catalytic activity in vivo. That key physical and functional properties are also shared by yeast SDS3 underscores the central role of the Sin3-HDAC-Sds3 complex in eukaryotic cell biology, and the discovery of mSds3 in mammalian cells provides a new avenue for modulating the activity of this complex in human disease.
Similar to rats, systemic pilocarpine injection causes status epilepticus (SE) and the eventual development of spontaneous seizures and mossy fiber sprouting in C57BL/6 and CD1 mice, but the physiological correlates of these events have not been identified in mice. Population responses in granule cells of the dentate gyrus were examined in transverse slices of the ventral hippocampus from pilocarpine-treated and untreated mice. In Mg(2+)-free bathing medium containing bicuculline, conditions designed to increase excitability in the slices, electrical stimulation of the hilus resulted in a single population spike in granule cells from control mice and pilocarpine-treated mice that did not experience SE. In SE survivors, similar stimulation resulted in a population spike followed, at a variable latency, by negative DC shifts and repetitive afterdischarges of 3-60 s duration, which were blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Focal glutamate photostimulation of the granule cell layer at sites distant from the recording pipette resulted in population responses of 1-30 s duration in slices from SE survivors but not other groups. These data support the hypothesis that SE-induced mossy fiber sprouting and synaptic reorganization are relevant characteristics of seizure development in these murine strains, resembling rat models of human temporal lobe epilepsy.

Simvastatin-induced bilateral leg compartment syndrome and myonecrosis associated with hypothyroidism.
Since 1975 mitomycin C (MMC) has been suggested to be cardiotoxic, especially when combined with or given following doxorubicin. Data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known. We have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects. Forty-four MMC-treated patients were studied, 37 of them could be evaluated. All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations, chest X-rays, electro- and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) determinations. The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level. One of the patients developed cardiac failure after 30 mg m-2 MMC and only 150 mg m-2 doxorubicin. The cardiac failure was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test. None of the other patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity, nor did the studied parameters change. The literature on this subject was also reviewed. Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature, we suggest that MMC-related cardiotoxicity is dose dependent, occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m-2 or more, mainly in patients also (previously or simultaneously) treated with doxorubicin. The incidence is likely to be less than 10% even for this risk group.
Since BRCA1, the first major gene responsible for inherited breast cancer, was cloned, more than 50 unique mutations have been detected in the germline of individuals with breast and ovarian cancer. In high-risk pedigrees, female carriers of BRCA1 mutations have an 80-90% lifetime risk of breast cancer, and a 40-50% risk of ovarian cancer. However, the mutation stats of individuals unselected for breast or ovarian cancer has not been determined, and it is not known whether mutations in such individuals confer the same risk of cancer as in individuals from the high-risk families studied so far. Following the finding of a 185delAG frameshift mutation in several Ashkenazi Jewish breast/ovarian families, we have determined the frequency of this mutation in 858 Ashkenazim seeking genetic testing for conditions unrelated to cancer, and in 815 reference individuals not selected for ethnic origin. We observed the 185delAG mutation in 0. 9% of Ashkenazim (95% confidence limit, 0. 4-1. 8%) and in none of the reference samples. Our results suggest that one in a hundred women of Ashkenazi descent may be at especially high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer.
Since bupivacaine and epinephrine may both precipitate dysrhythmias, circulating bupivacaine during regional anesthesia could potentiate dysrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine. We therefore examined whether bupivacaine alters the dysrhythmogenicity of subsequent administration of epinephrine in conscious, healthy dogs and in anesthetized dogs with myocardial infarction. Forty-one conscious dogs received 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 epinephrine. Seventeen animals responded with ventricular tachycardia (VT) within 3 min. After 3 h, these responders randomly received 1 or 2 mg/kg bupivacaine or saline over 5 min, followed by 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 epinephrine. In the bupivacaine groups, epinephrine caused fewer prodysrhythmic effects than without bupivacaine. VT appeared in fewer dogs and at a later time, and there were more sinoatrial beats and less ectopies. Epinephrine shortened QT less after bupivacaine than in control animals. One day after experimental myocardial infarction, six additional halothane-anesthetized dogs received 4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 epinephrine until VT appeared. After 45 min, 1 mg/kg bupivacaine was injected over 5 min, again followed by 4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 epinephrine. In these dogs, the prodysrhythmic response to epinephrine was also mitigated by preceding bupivacaine. Bupivacaine antagonizes epinephrine dysrhythmogenicity in conscious dogs susceptible to VT and in anesthetized dogs with spontaneous postinfarct dysrhythmias. There is no evidence that systemic subtoxic bupivacaine administration enhances the dysrhythmogenicity of subsequent epinephrine.
Since tamoxifen is widely used in breast cancer treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of breast cancer, its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined. We have investigated the association between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen use or other treatments in women treated for breast cancer in a case-control study. Cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after breast cancer (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of breast cancer and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included. Women who had received tamoxifen were significantly more likely to have endometrial cancer diagnosed than those who had not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001). Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose of tamoxifen received (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dose. Women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk (crude relative risk = 7.8, p = 0.0001). After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk was higher for tamoxifen users (p = 0.0012), treatment for more than 3 years (all p < 0.03) and pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). Women who had endometrial cancer and had received tamoxifen had more advanced disease and poorer prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this treatment. Our results suggest a causal role of tamoxifen in endometrial cancer, particularly when used as currently proposed for breast cancer prevention. Pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with breast cancer. Endometrial cancers diagnosed in women treated with tamoxifen have poorer prognosis. Women who receive tamoxifen for breast cancer should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment. A long-term evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of tamoxifen as a preventive treatment for breast cancer is clearly warranted.
Since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors into the adjunctive treatment of patients with congestive heart failure, cases of severe hypotension, especially on the first day of treatment, have occasionally been reported. To assess the safety of the ACE inhibitor enalapril a multicenter, randomized, prazosin-controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on the first day of treatment. Trial medication was 2.5 mg enalapril or 0.5 prazosin. Subjects were 1210 inpatients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II and III. Patients who received enalapril experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic hypotension (5.2%) than the patients who received prazosin (12.9%). All patients recovered. It was concluded that treatment with enalapril was well tolerated and it is, therefore, unreasonable to restrict the initiation of treatment with enalapril to inpatients.
Single nucleotide polymorphism in ABCG2 is associated with irinotecan-induced severe myelosuppression.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms of cytokine genes in the healthy Slovak population.
Sinus arrest associated with continuous-infusion cimetidine.
Sinus node dysfunction has been reported most frequently among the adverse cardiovascular effects of lithium. In the present case, complete atrioventricular (AV) block with syncopal attacks developed secondary to lithium therapy, necessitating permanent pacemaker implantation. Serum lithium levels remained under or within the therapeutic range during the syncopal attacks. Lithium should be used with extreme caution, especially in patients with mild disturbance of AV conduction.
Sirolimus (SRL) is a new, potent immunosuppressive agent. More recently, proteinuria has been reported as a consequence of sirolimus therapy, although the mechanism has remained unclear. We retrospectively examined the records of 25 renal transplant patients, who developed or displayed increased proteinuria after SRL conversion. The patient cohort (14 men, 11 women) was treated with SRL as conversion therapy, due to chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) (n = 15) neoplasia (n = 8); Kaposi's sarcoma, Four skin cancers, One intestinal tumors, One renal cell carsinom) or BK virus nephropathy (n = 2). SRL was started at a mean of 78 +/- 42 (15 to 163) months after transplantation. Mean follow-up on SRL therapy was 20 +/- 12 (6 to 43) months. Proteinuria increased from 0.445 (0 to 1.5) g/d before conversion to 3.2 g/dL (0.2 to 12) after conversion (P = 0.001). Before conversion 8 (32%) patients had no proteinuria, whereas afterwards all patients had proteinuria. In 28% of patients proteinuria remained unchanged, whereas it increased in 68% of patients. In 40% it increased by more than 100%. Twenty-eight percent of patients showed increased proteinuria to the nephrotic range. Biopsies performed in five patients revealed new pathological changes: One membranoproliferative glomerulopathy and interstitial nephritis. These patients showed persistently good graft function. Serum creatinine values did not change significantly: 1.98 +/- 0.8 mg/dL before SRL therapy and 2.53 +/- 1.9 mg/dL at last follow-up (P = .14). Five grafts were lost and the patients returned to dialysis. Five patients displayed CAN and Kaposi's sarcoma. Mean urinary protein of patients who returned to dialysis was 1.26 (0.5 to 3.5) g/d before and 4.7 (3 to 12) g/d after conversion (P = .01). Mean serum creatinine level before conversion was 2.21 mg/dL and thereafter, 4.93 mg/dL (P = .02). Heavy proteinuria was common after the use of SRL as rescue therapy for renal transplantation. Therefore, conversion should be considered for patients who have not developed advanced CAN and proteinuria. The possibility of de novo glomerular pathology under SRL treatment requires further investigation by renal biopsy.
Sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for calcineurin-free immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.
Sirolimus is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the raptor-containing mammalian target of rapamycin protein kinase. Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy. Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis, autoimmunity, cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation. Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-nephrotoxic drug'. However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction. A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre-existing chronic renal damage. The mechanisms of sirolimus-associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal. It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability/injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive. The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes. Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney, the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed. Further long-term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future.
Sirolimus-associated proteinuria and renal dysfunction.
Six cases of cauda equina syndrome with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993-1997. All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5% lignocaine. Five cases had single-shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block. The dose of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg. Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine. In the other 3 cases, direct neurotoxicity was also probable, but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology. All cases sustained permanent neurological deficits. We recommend that hyperbaric lignocaine should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2% and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg.
Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of phenacetin is associated with the development of chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19. As a result of these and other studies, phenacetin has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries. However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also associated with chronic renal failure and ESRD, with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4. These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of ESRD, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former. This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs themselves. A lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone. Thus, acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics, whereas phenacetin was available only in combinations. The possibility that habitual use of acetaminophen alone increases the risk of ESRD has not been clearly demonstrated, but cannot be dismissed.
Six new variants of human erythrocyte G6PD have been characterized. All of them were found in Italian males and all were associated with enzyme deficiency, but only two with signs of haemolysis. These and other variants reported in the literature, which must thus far be regarded as sporadic, are found to map in parts of Italy where common types of G6PD deficiency are also prevalent..
Six stable psychiatric outpatients with hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea associated with their neuroleptic medications were treated with bromocriptine. Daily dosages of 5-10 mg corrected the hyperprolactinemia and restored menstruation in four of the six patients. One woman, however, developed worsened psychiatric symptoms while taking bromocriptine, and it was discontinued. Thus, three of six patients had their menstrual irregularity successfully corrected with bromocriptine. This suggests that bromocriptine should be further evaluated as potential therapy for neuroleptic-associated hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea/galactorrhea.
Sixty patients (age-range one month to 14 years) with other types of epilepsy than infantile spasms were treated with clonazepam. Disappearance of seizures and normalization of abnormal EEG with disappearance of seizures were recognized in 77% and 50%, respectively. Seizures disappeared in 71% of the patients with generalized seizures and 89% of partial seizures. Improvement of abnormal EEG was noticed in 76% of diffuse paroxysms and in 67% of focal paroxysms. In excellent cases, mean effective dosages were 0.086 +/- 0.021 mg/kg/day in infants and 0.057 +/- 0.022 mg/kg/day in schoolchildren, this difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.005). The incidence of side effects such as drowsiness and ataxia was only 5%.
Sixty-two patients with a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are reported. Clinical manifestations of this disorder include hemorrhage or, more frequently, thromboembolic events in patients receiving heparin. Laboratory testing has revealed a falling platelet count, increased resistance to heparin, and aggregation of platelets by the patient's plasma when heparin is added. Immunologic testing has demonstrated the presence of a heparin-dependent platelet membrane antibody. The 20 deaths, 52 hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, and 21 surgical procedures to manage the complications confirm the seriousness of the disorder. Specific risk factors have not been identified; therefore, all patients receiving heparin should be monitored. If the platelet count falls to less than 100,000/mm3, while the patient is receiving heparin, platelet aggregation testing, using the patient's plasma, is indicated. Management consists of cessation of heparin, platelet anti-aggregating agents, and alternate forms of anticoagulation when indicated.
Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation, spasticity, and deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). To define the molecular defects causing SLS, we performed mutation analysis of the FALDH gene in probands from 63 kindreds with SLS. Among these patients, 49 different mutations-including 10 deletions, 2 insertions, 22 amino acid substitutions, 3 nonsense mutations, 9 splice-site defects, and 3 complex mutations-were found. All of the patients with SLS were found to carry mutations. Nineteen of the missense mutations resulted in a severe reduction of FALDH enzyme catalytic activity when expressed in mammalian cells, but one mutation (798G-- > C [K266N]) seemed to have a greater effect on mRNA stability. The splice-site mutations led to exon skipping or utilization of cryptic acceptor-splice sites. Thirty-seven mutations were private, and 12 mutations were seen in two or more probands of European or Middle Eastern descent. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in the FALDH gene. At least four of the common mutations (551C-- > T, 682C-- > T, 733G-- > A, and 798 + 1delG) were associated with multiple SNP haplotypes, suggesting that these mutations originated independently on more than one occasion or were ancient SLS genes that had undergone intragenic recombination. Our results demonstrate that SLS is caused by a strikingly heterogeneous group of mutations in the FALDH gene and provide a framework for understanding the genetic basis of SLS and the development of DNA-based diagnostic tests..

Skin rashes, proteinuria, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis and myasthenia gravis have all been recorded as complications of penicillamine therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A patient who had developed all 5 is now described. The skin lesion resembled elastosis perforans serpiginosa, which has been reported as a rare side effect in patients with Wilson's disease but not in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with penicillamine.
Skin reactions associated with oral coumarin-derived anticoagulants are an uncommon occurrence. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LV) is primarily a cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, though systemic involvement may be encountered. We report 4 patients with late-onset LV probably due to warfarin. All 4 patients presented with skin eruptions that developed after receiving warfarin for several years. The results of skin lesion biopsies were available in 3 patients, confirming LV Cutaneous lesions resolved in all patients after warfarin was discontinued. In 2 of the 4 patients, rechallenge with warfarin led to recurrence of the lesions. LV may be a late-onset adverse reaction associated with warfarin therapy.
Sleep plays an important role in the consolidation and integration of memory in a process called overnight memory consolidation. Previous studies indicate that ecstasy users have marked and persistent neurocognitive and sleep-related impairments. We extend past research by examining overnight memory consolidation among regular ecstasy users (n=12) and drug naive healthy controls (n=26). Memory recall of word pairs was evaluated before and after a period of sleep, with and without interference prior to testing. In addition, we assessed neurocognitive performances across tasks of learning, memory and executive functioning. Ecstasy users demonstrated impaired overnight memory consolidation, a finding that was more pronounced following associative interference. Additionally, ecstasy users demonstrated impairments on tasks recruiting frontostriatal and hippocampal neural circuitry, in the domains of proactive interference memory, long-term memory, encoding, working memory and complex planning. We suggest that ecstasy-associated dysfunction in fronto-temporal circuitry may underlie overnight consolidation memory impairments in regular ecstasy users.
Slit2-Mediated chemorepulsion and collapse of developing forebrain axons.
Smad proteins are key intracellular signaling effectors for the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily of peptide growth factors. Following receptor-induced activation, Smads move into the nucleus to activate transcription of a select set of target genes. The activity of Smad proteins must be tightly regulated to exert the biological effects of different ligands in a timely manner. Here, we report the identification of Smurf2, a new member of the Hect family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Smurf2 selectively interacts with receptor-regulated Smads and preferentially targets Smad1 for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. At higher expression levels, Smurf2 also decreases the protein levels of Smad2, but not Smad3. In Xenopus embryos, ectopic Smurf2 expression specifically inhibits Smad1 responses and thereby affects embryonic patterning by bone morphogenetic protein signals. These findings suggest that Smurf2 may regulate the competence of a cell to respond to transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein signaling through a distinct degradation pathway that is similar to, yet independent of, Smurf1.
Smads, the intracellular effectors of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members, are somatically mutated at high frequency in particular types of human cancers. Certain of these mutations affect the Smad amino-terminal domain, which, in the case of Smad3 and Smad4, binds DNA. We investigated the functional consequences of four missense mutations in the Smad4 amino-terminal domain found in human tumors. The mutant proteins were found to have impaired abilities to bind DNA although they were fully capable of forming complexes with Smad3. All four Smad4 mutants showed decreased protein stability compared to wild-type Smad4. Two of the Smad4 mutants (G65V and P130S) were translocated to the nucleus and were capable of transactivating a Smad-dependent promoter in a ligand-dependent manner. In contrast, the L43S and R100T mutants were not translocated efficiently to the nucleus and consequently resulted in severely defective transcriptional responses to TGF-beta. Moreover, we demonstrate here the critical importance of two basic residues in the beta-hairpin loop of Smad3 or Smad4 for DNA binding, consistent with predictions from the Smad3 crystal structure. In addition, our results reveal that in the TGF-beta-induced heteromeric signaling complex, loss of DNA binding of Smad4 can be compensated by Smad3, however, both Smad3 and Smad4 are needed for efficient DNA binding and signaling. In conclusion, mutations in the amino-terminal domain of Smad4, that are found in cancer, show loss of multiple functional properties which may contribute to tumorigenesis.
Small (100-260 kb), nested deletions were characterized in DNA from two unrelated patients with familial adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Three candidate genes located within the deleted region were ascertained and a previous candidate gene, MCC, was shown to be located outside the deleted region. One of the new genes contained sequence identical to SRP19, the gene coding for the 19 kd component of the ribosomal signal recognition particle. The second, provisionally designated DP1 (deleted in polyposis 1), was found to be transcribed in the same orientation as MCC. Two other cDNAs, DP2 and DP3, were found to overlap, forming a single gene, DP2. 5, that is transcribed in the same orientation as SRP19.
Small GTPases of the Rho family have a critical role in controlling cell morphology, motility and adhesion through dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . Individual Rho GTPases have been shown to regulate distinct components of the cytoskeletal architecture; RhoA stimulates the bundling of actin filaments into stress fibres , Rac reorganises actin to produce membrane sheets or lamellipodia and Cdc42 causes the formation of thin, actin-rich surface projections called filopodia . We have isolated a new Rho-family GTPase, Rif (Rho in filopodia), and shown that it represents an alternative signalling route to the generation of filopodial structures. Coordinated regulation of Rho-family GTPases can be used to generate more complicated actin rearrangements, such as those underlying cell migration . In addition to inducing filopodia, Rif functions cooperatively with Cdc42 and Rac to generate additional structures, increasing the diversity of actin-based morphology.

Sodium bicarbonate alleviates penile pain induced by intracavernous injections for erectile dysfunction.
Sodium channel beta-subunits modulate channel gating, assembly, and cell surface expression in heterologous cell systems. We generated beta2(-/-) mice to investigate the role of beta2 in control of sodium channel density, localization, and function in neurons in vivo. Measurements of [(3)H]saxitoxin (STX) binding showed a significant reduction in the level of plasma membrane sodium channels in beta2(-/-) neurons. The loss of beta2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in sodium current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons. The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced, and the threshold for action potential generation was increased, indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane sodium channels. In contrast, the conduction velocity, the number and size of axons in the optic nerve, and the specific localization of Na(v)1.6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged. beta2(-/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to seizures, as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures, but seemed normal in other neurological tests. Our observations show that beta2-subunits play an important role in the regulation of sodium channel density and function in neurons in vivo and are required for normal action potential generation and control of excitability.
Sodium chloride solution (0.9%) or noradrenaline in doses of 4, 12 and 36 micrograms h-1 kg-1 was infused for five consecutive days, either intrarenally (by a new technique) or intravenously into rats with one kidney removed. Intrarenal infusion of noradrenaline caused hypertension at doses which did not do so when infused intravenously. Intrarenal compared with intravenous infusion of noradrenaline caused higher plasma noradrenaline concentrations and a shift of the plasma noradrenaline concentration-blood pressure effect curve towards lower plasma noradrenaline levels. These results suggest that hypertension after chronic intrarenal noradrenaline infusion is produced by relatively higher levels of circulating noradrenaline and by triggering of an additional intrarenal pressor mechanism.
Sodium status influences chronic amphotericin B nephrotoxicity in rats.
Solar UV light comprises UVB wavelengths (290-320 nm) and UVA wavelengths (320-400 nm). UVB radiation reaches the epidermis and, to a lesser extent, the upper part of the dermis, while UVA radiation penetrates more deeply into human skin. Existing studies have demonstrated that UV-irradiated epidermal keratinocytes release cytokines that indirectly promote MMP-1 production in dermal fibroblasts. In this study, we first investigated the effect of IL-1 on MAPK activity, c-Jun and c-Fos mRNA expression, and MMP-1 and MMP-2 production in UVA-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts. The results showed that UVA irradiation dose-dependently increased MMP-1 but not MMP-2 production in human skin fibroblasts. IL-1alpha and IL-1beta promoted MMP-1 but not MMP-2 production in UVA-irradiated fibroblasts. Both IL-1alpha and IL-1beta activated MAP kinase, significantly elevating c-Jun and c-Fos mRNA expression. We then investigated the indirect effect of UVB-irradiated keratinocyte culture medium on MMP-1 production in UVA-irradiated primary cultured human dermal fibroblasts and the effect of IL-1Ra. The results showed that cell culture medium from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes increased MMP-1 production in UVA-irradiated fibroblasts, and IL-1Ra dose-dependently inhibited MMP-1 production. IL-1Ra dose-dependently inhibited c-Jun mRNA expression of fibroblasts with no significant effect on c-Fos mRNA expression. These results demonstrate that UVB-irradiated keratinocytes promoted MMP-1 production in UVA-irradiated fibroblasts in a paracrine manner while IL-1Ra reduced MMP-1 production through inhibiting c-Jun mRNA expression. Collectively, our data suggest that IL-1 plays an important role in the dermal collagen degradation associated with UV-induced premature aging of the skin and IL-1Ra may be applied for the prevention and treatment of photoaging.

Some CD2 family receptors stimulate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through a signaling pathway, which is dependent on the recruitment of an adapter protein called SLAM-associated protein (SAP). In this work we identify a novel leukocyte cell surface receptor of the CD2 family called CD2-like receptor activating cytotoxic cells (CRACC). CRACC is expressed on cytotoxic lymphocytes, activated B cells, and mature dendritic cells, and activates NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Remarkably, although CRACC displays cytoplasmic motifs similar to those recruiting SAP, CRACC-mediated cytotoxicity occurs in the absence of SAP and requires activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1/2. Thus, CRACC is a unique CD2-like receptor which mediates NK cell activation through a SAP-independent extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated pathway.
Some G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are regulators of cell adhesion via inside-out effector signaling pathways. Such is the case with leukocyte chemokine receptors which stimulate intracellular second messenger pathways resulting in upregulation of integrin adhesion to ligands present in the extracellular matrix or on opposing cells resulting in chemotaxis and extravasation during immune surveillance. Remarkably, a family of GPCRs has recently been discovered that may themselves be triggered by cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. Along with a canonical heptahelical membrane-spanning region, these intriguing proteins contain putative cell adhesion-like modules. The evidence to date suggests that they are involved in lymphocyte activation, macrophage biology, synaptic exocytosis and planar polarization during organogenesis.

Sorting nexin (SNX) 1 and SNX2 are mammalian orthologs of Vps5p, a yeast protein that is a subunit of a large multimeric complex, termed the retromer complex, involved in retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. We report the cloning and characterization of human orthologs of three additional components of the complex: Vps26p, Vps29p, and Vps35p. The close structural similarity between the yeast and human proteins suggests a similarity in function. We used both yeast two-hybrid assays and expression in mammalian cells to define the binding interactions among these proteins. The data suggest a model in which hVps35 serves as the core of a multimeric complex by binding directly to hVps26, hVps29, and SNX1. Deletional analyses of hVps35 demonstrate that amino acid residues 1-53 and 307-796 of hVps35 bind to the coiled coil-containing domain of SNX1. In contrast, hVps26 binds to amino acid residues 1-172 of hVps35, whereas hVps29 binds to amino acid residues 307-796 of hVps35. Furthermore, hVps35, hVps29, and hVps26 have been found in membrane-associated and cytosolic compartments. Gel filtration chromatography of COS7 cell cytosol showed that both recombinant and endogenous hVps35, hVps29, and hVps26 coelute as a large complex ( approximately 220-440 kDa). In the absence of hVps35, neither hVps26 nor hVps29 is found in the large complex. These data provide the first insights into the binding interactions among subunits of a putative mammalian retromer complex.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat that is transcribed as part of an untranslated RNA. As a step towards understanding the molecular pathology of SCA8, we have defined the genomic organization of the SCA8 RNA transcripts and assembled a 166 kb segment of genomic sequence containing the repeat. The most striking feature of the SCA8 transcripts is that the most 5' exon is transcribed through the first exon of another gene that is transcribed in the opposite orientation. This gene arrangement suggests that the SCA8 transcript is an endogenous antisense RNA that overlaps the transcription and translation start sites as well as the first splice donor sequence of the sense gene. The sense transcript encodes a 748 amino acid protein with a predicted domain structure typical of a family of actin-organizing proteins related to the Drosophila Kelch gene, and so has been given the name Kelch-like 1 (KLHL1). We have identified the full-length cDNA sequence for both the human and mouse KLHLI genes, and have elucidated the general genomic organization of the human gene. The predicted open reading frame and promoter region are highly conserved, and both genes are primarily expressed in specific brain tissues, including the cerebellum, the tissue most affected by SCA8. Transfection studies with epitope-tagged KLHL1 demonstrate that the protein localizes to the cytoplasm, suggesting that it may play a role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton of the brain cells in which it is expressed.
Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is a member of the CAG/polyglutamine repeat disease family. In this family of disorders, a normally polymorphic CAG repeat becomes expanded, resulting in expression of an expanded polyglutamine domain in the disease gene product. Experimental models of polyglutamine disease implicate the nucleus in pathogenesis; however, the link between intranuclear expression of expanded polyglutamine and neuronal dysfunction remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that ataxin-3, the disease protein in SCA3/MJD, adopts a unique conformation when expressed within the nucleus of transfected cells. The monoclonal antibody 1C2 is known preferentially to bind expanded polyglutamine, but we find that it also binds a fragment of ataxin-3 containing a normal glutamine repeat. In addition, expression of ataxin-3 within the nucleus exposes the glutamine domain of the full-length non-pathological protein, allowing it to bind the monoclonal antibody 1C2. Fractionation and immunochemical experiments indicate that this novel conformation of intranuclear ataxin-3 is not due to proteolysis, suggesting instead that association with nuclear protein (s) alters the structure of full-length ataxin-3 which exposes the polyglutamine domain. This conformationally altered ataxin-3 is bound to the nuclear matrix. The pathological form of ataxin-3 with an expanded polyglutamine domain also associates with the nuclear matrix. These data suggest that an early event in the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD may be an altered conformation of ataxin-3 within the nucleus that exposes the polyglutamine domain..

Split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM, also called ectrodactyly) is a clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous group of limb malformations. Several SHFM loci have been mapped, including SHFM1 (7q21), SHFM2 (Xq26), SHFM3 (10q24), SHFM4 (3q27) and SHFM5 (2q31). To date, mutations in a gene (TP63) have only been identified for SHFM4. SHFM3 has been shown by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to be caused by an approximately 500 kb DNA rearrangement at 10q24. This region contains a number of candidate genes for SHFM3, though which gene(s) is (are) involved in the pathogenesis of SHFM3 is not known. Our aim in this study was to improve the diagnosis of SHFM3, and to begin to understand which genes are involved in SHFM3. Here we show, using two different techniques, FISH and quantitative PCR that SHFM3 is caused by a minimal 325 kb duplication containing only two genes (BTRC and POLL). The data presented provide improved methods for diagnosis and begin to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of SHFM3. Expression analysis of 13 candidate genes within and flanking the duplicated region shows that BTRC (present in three copies) and SUFU (present in two copies) are overexpressed in SHFM3 patients compared to controls. Our data suggest that SHFM3 may be caused by overexpression of BTRC and SUFU, both of which are involved in beta-catenin signalling.

Spo11 is a meiosis-specific protein in yeast that has been found covalently bound to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during the early stages of meiosis. These DSBs initiate homologous recombination, which is required for proper segregation of chromosomes and the generation of genetic diversity during meiosis. Here we report the cloning, characterization, tissue expression, and chromosomal localization of both mouse and human homologues of Spo11. The putative mouse and human proteins are 82% identical and share approximately 25% identity with other family members. Northern blot analysis revealed testis-specific expression for both genes, but RT-PCR results showed ubiquitous expression of at least a portion of Spo11 in mouse. Human SPO11 was also detected in several somatic tissues. Mouse Spo11 was localized to chromosome 2H4, and human SPO11 was localized to chromosome 20q13.2-q13.3, a region amplified in some breast and ovarian tumors.
Spontaneous reversion of novel Lesch-Nyhan mutation by HPRT gene rearrangement.
Sporadic prostate carcinoma is the most common male cancer in the Western world, yet many of the major genetic events involved in the progression of this often fatal cancer remain to be elucidated. Numerous cytogenetic and allelotype studies have reported frequent loss of heterozygosity on chromosomal arm 10q in sporadic prostate cancer. Deletion mapping studies have unambiguously identified a region of chromosome 10q23 to be the minimal area of loss. A new tumor suppressor gene, PTEN/MMAC1, was isolated recently at this region of chromosome 10q23 and found to be inactivated by mutation in three prostate cancer cell lines. We screened 80 prostate tumors by microsatellite analysis and found chromosome 10q23 to be deleted in 23 cases. We then proceeded with sequence analysis of the entire PTEN/MMAC1 coding region and tested for homozygous deletion with new intragenic markers in these 23 cases with 10q23 loss of heterozygosity. The identification of the second mutational event in 10 (43%) tumors establishes PTEN/MMAC1 as a main inactivation target of 10q loss in sporadic prostate cancer..

Statins can cause a necrotizing myopathy and hyperCKaemia which is reversible on cessation of the drug. What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby statins may induce a myopathy, which persists or may progress after stopping the drug. We investigated the muscle pathology in 8 such cases. All had myofibre necrosis but only 3 had an inflammatory infiltrate. In all cases there was diffuse or multifocal up-regulation of MHC-I expression even in non-necrotic fibres. Progressive improvement occurred in 7 cases after commencement of prednisolone and methotrexate, and in one case spontaneously. These observations suggest that statins may initiate an immune-mediated myopathy that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy. The mechanism of this myopathy is uncertain but may involve the induction by statins of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with associated up-regulation of MHC-I expression and antigen presentation by muscle fibres.

Abnormal movements and deafness occurred only in rats treated during the preweaning period; within this period the greatest sensitivities for these abnormalities occurred from 2 to 11-17 and 5 to 11 days of age, respectively, indicating that the cochlea is more sensitive to streptomycin than the site (vestibular or central) responsible for the dyskinesias.

Studies concerning with pathogenesis of gastric hemorrhage and mucosal ulceration produced in atherosclerotic rats are lacking. The aim of this study is to examine the role of gastric acid back-diffusion, mast cell histamine release, lipid peroxide (LPO) generation and mucosal microvascular permeability in modulating gastric hemorrhage and ulcer in rats with atherosclerosis induced by coadministration of vitamin D2 and cholesterol. Additionally, the protective effect of verapamil on this ulcer model was evaluated. Male Wistar rats were challenged intragastrically once daily for 9 days with 1.0 ml/kg of corn oil containing vitamin D2 and cholesterol to induce atherosclerosis. Control rats received corn oil only. After gastric surgery, rat stomachs were irrigated for 3 h with either simulated gastric juice or normal saline. Gastric acid back-diffusion, mucosal LPO generation, histamine concentration, microvascular permeability, luminal hemoglobin content and ulcer areas were determined. Elevated atherosclerotic parameters, such as serum calcium, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentration were obtained in atherosclerotic rats. Severe gastric ulcers accompanied with increased ulcerogenic factors, including gastric acid back-diffusion, histamine release, LPO generation and luminal hemoglobin content were also observed in these rats. Moreover, a positive correlation of histamine to gastric hemorrhage and to ulcer was found in those atherosclerotic rats. This hemorrhagic ulcer and various ulcerogenic parameters were dose-dependently ameliorated by daily intragastric verapamil. Atherosclerosis could produce gastric hemorrhagic ulcer via aggravation of gastric acid back-diffusion, LPO generation, histamine release and microvascular permeability that could be ameliorated by verapamil in rats.

Studies of transcriptional activation by interferons and a variety of cytokines have led to the identification of a family of proteins that serve as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). STAT4 is phosphorylated following interleukin (IL)-12 stimulation and is essential for IL-12 signal transduction. The human STAT4 cDNA was cloned, and both STAT4 and STAT1 genes were mapped to human chromosome bands 2q32.2-->q32.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. These results suggest that STAT4 and STAT1 may have arisen via a tandem gene duplication. However, human STAT1 is expressed ubiquitously, whereas human STAT4 is expressed in several tissues including spleen, heart, brain, peripheral blood cells, and testis.

Studies to clone a cell-surface DNA-binding protein involved in the binding and internalization of extracellular DNA have led to the isolation of a gene for a membrane-associated nucleic acid-binding protein (MNAB). The full-length cDNA is 4.3 kilobases with an open reading frame of 3576 base pairs encoding a protein of approximately 130 kDa (GenBank accession numbers and ). The MNAB gene is on human chromosome 9 with wide expression in normal tissues and tumor cells. A C3HC4 RING finger and a CCCH zinc finger have been identified in the amino-terminal half of the protein. MNAB bound DNA (K(D) approximately 4 nm) and mutagenesis of a single conserved amino acid in the zinc finger reduced DNA binding by 50%. A potential transmembrane domain exists near the carboxyl terminus. Antibodies against the amino-terminal half of the protein immunoprecipitated a protein of molecular mass approximately 150 kDa and reacted with cell surfaces. The MNAB protein is membrane-associated and primarily localized to the perinuclear space, probably to the endoplasmic reticulum or trans-Golgi network. Characterization of the MNAB protein as a cell-surface DNA-binding protein, critical in binding and internalization of extracellular DNA, awaits confirmation of its localization to cell surfaces.
Studies were performed to examine the mechanisms for the protective effects of free radical scavengers on gentamicin (GM)-mediated nephropathy. Administration of GM at 40 mg/kg sc for 13 days to rats induced a significant reduction in renal blood flow (RBF) and inulin clearance (CIn) as well as marked tubular damage. A significant reduction in urinary guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) excretion and a significant increase in renal cortical renin and endothelin-1 contents were also observed in GM-mediated nephropathy. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) or dimethylthiourea (DMTU) significantly lessened the GM-induced decrement in CIn. The SOD-induced increase in glomerular filtration rate was associated with a marked improvement in RBF, an increase in urinary cGMP excretion, and a decrease in renal renin and endothelin-1 content. SOD did not attenuate the tubular damage. In contrast, DMTU significantly reduced the tubular damage and lipid peroxidation, but it did not affect renal hemodynamics and vasoactive substances. Neither SOD nor DMTU affected the renal cortical GM content in GM-treated rats. These results suggest that 1) both SOD and DMTU have protective effects on GM-mediated nephropathy, 2) the mechanisms for the protective effects differ for SOD and DMTU, and 3) superoxide anions play a critical role in GM-induced renal vasoconstriction.

Suboptimal seizure duration is commonly encountered in electroconvulsive therapy practice, especially in older patients with higher seizure thresholds. Intravenous caffeine is commonly used to improve seizure duration and quality in such patients and is generally well tolerated aside from occasional reports of relatively benign ventricular ectopy. We describe a patient with no previous history of cardiac disease or arrhythmia who developed sustained bigeminy and 2 brief runs of ventricular tachycardia after caffeine administration. Although intravenous caffeine is generally well tolerated, the clinician should be aware of the potential for unpredictable and serious ventricular arrhythmias.
Subsets of glycoproteins are thought to require lectin-like membrane receptors for efficient export out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To identify new members related to two previously characterized intracellular lectins ERGIC-53/p58 and VIP36, we carried out an extensive database search using the conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) as a search string. A gene, more closely related to VIP36 than to ERGIC-53/p58, and hence called VIPL (VIP36-Like), was identified. VIPL has been conserved through evolution from zebra fish to man. The 2.4-kb VIPL mRNA was widely expressed to varying levels in different tissues. Using an antiserum prepared against the CRD, the 32-kDa VIPL protein was detected in various cell lines. The single N-linked glycan of VIPL remained endoglycosidase H-sensitive during a 2-h pulse-chase, even when the protein was overexpressed or mutated to allow export to the plasma membrane. VIPL localized primarily to the ER and partly to the Golgi complex. Like VIP36, the cytoplasmic tail of VIPL terminates in the sequence KRFY, a motif characteristic for proteins recycling between the ER and ERGIC/cis-Golgi. Mutating the retrograde transport signal KR to AA resulted in transport of VIPL to the cell surface. Finally, knock-down of VIPL mRNA using siRNA significantly slowed down the secretion of two glycoproteins (M(R) 35 and 250 kDa) to the medium, suggesting that VIPL may also function as an ER export receptor.

Such organophosphorus (OP) compounds as diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), sarin and soman are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) and butyrylcholinesterases (BChEs). The acute toxicity of OPs is the result of their irreversible binding with AChEs in the central nervous system (CNS), which elevates acetylcholine (ACh) levels. The protective action of subcutaneously (SC) administered antidotes or their combinations in DFP (2.0 mg/kg BW) intoxication was studied in 9-10-weeks-old Han-Wistar male rats. The rats received AChE reactivator pralidoxime-2-chloride (2PAM) (30.0 mg/kg BW), anticonvulsant diazepam (2.0 mg/kg BW), A(1)-adenosine receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyl adenosine (CPA) (2.0 mg/kg BW), NMDA-receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (+-MK801 hydrogen maleate) (2.0 mg/kg BW) or their combinations with cholinolytic drug atropine sulfate (50.0 mg/kg BW) immediately or 30 min after the single SC injection of DFP. The control rats received atropine sulfate, but also saline and olive oil instead of other antidotes and DFP, respectively. All rats were terminated either 24 h or 3 weeks after the DFP injection. The rats treated with DFP-atropine showed severe typical OP-induced toxicity signs. When CPA, diazepam or 2PAM was given immediately after DFP-atropine, these treatments prevented, delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning. Atropine-MK801 did not offer any additional protection against DFP toxicity. In conclusion, CPA, diazepam and 2PAM in combination with atropine prevented the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning and thus reduced the toxicity of DFP in rat.
Sulfadiazine acute nephrotoxicity is reviving specially because of its use in toxoplasmosis in HIV-positive patients. We report 4 cases, one of them in a previously healthy person. Under treatment with sulfadiazine they developed oliguria, abdominal pain, renal failure and showed multiple radiolucent renal calculi in echography. All patients recovered their previous normal renal function after adequate hydration and alcalinization. A nephrostomy tube had to be placed in one of the patients for ureteral lithiasis in a single functional kidney. None of them needed dialysis or a renal biopsy because of a typical benign course. Treatment with sulfadiazine requires exquisite control of renal function, an increase in water ingestion and possibly the alcalinization of the urine. We communicate a case in a previously healthy person, a fact not found in the recent literature. Probably many more cases are not detected. We think that a prospective study would be useful.

Sulfation of endothelial glycoproteins by the sulfotransferase GlcNAc6ST-2 is a regulatory modification that promotes binding of the leukocyte adhesion molecule L-selectin. GlcNAc6ST-2 is a member of a family of related enzymes that act on similar carbohydrate substrates in vitro but discrete glycoproteins in vivo. We demonstrate that GlcNAc6ST-1, -2, and -3 have distinct Golgi distributions, with GlcNAc6ST-1 confined to the trans-Golgi network, GlcNAc6ST-3 confined to the early secretory pathway, and GlcNAc6ST-2 distributed throughout the Golgi. Their localization was correlated with preferred activity on either N-linked or O-linked glycoproteins. A chimera comprising the localization domain of GlcNAc6ST-1 fused to the catalytic domain of GlcNAc6ST-2 was confined to the trans-Golgi network and adopted the substrate preference of GlcNAc6ST-1. We propose a model in which Golgi enzyme localization and competition orchestrate the biosynthesis of L-selectin ligands.
Sulpiride is a selective D2-receptor antagonist with antipsychotic and antidepressant properties. Although initially thought to be free of extrapyramidal side effects, sulpiride-induced tardive dyskinesia and parkinsonism have been reported occasionally. We studied a 37-year-old man who developed persistent segmental dystonia within 2 months after starting sulpiride therapy. We could not find any previous reports of sulpiride-induced tardive dystonia.

Suprofen, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent. Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute flank pain syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system, 700,000 persons used the drug in the United States. Through August 1986, a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported. To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome, a case-control study was performed, comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 suprofen-exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome. Case patients were more likely to be men (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.1), suffer from hay fever and asthma (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-11.9); to participate in regular exercise (odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-30.7), especially in the use of Nautilus equipment (p = 0.02); and to use alcohol (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-17.5). Possible risk factors included young age, concurrent use of other analgesic agents (especially ibuprofen), preexisting renal disease, a history of kidney stones, a history of gout, a recent increase in activity, a recent increase in sun exposure, and residence in the Sunbelt. These were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance. These findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome: acute diffuse crystallization of uric acid in renal tubules.

Survival for patients with advanced head and neck carcinoma and esophageal carcinoma is poor with radiotherapy and/or surgery. Obviously, there is a need for effective chemotherapy. In the present study, cis-platin (80-120 mg/m2BSA) and 5-FU (1000 mg/m2BSA daily as a continuous infusion during 5 days) were given to 76 patients before radiotherapy and surgery. The aim of the study was to clarify the incidence and severity of adverse cardiac effects to this treatment. Before treatment all patients had a cardiac evaluation and during treatment serial ECG recordings were performed. In the pre-treatment evaluation, signs of cardiovascular disease were found in 33 patients (43%). During treatment, adverse cardiac effects were observed in 14 patients (18%). The mean age of these patients was the same as for the entire group, 64 years. The incidence of cardiotoxicity was not higher in patients with signs of cardiovascular disease than in those without in the pre-treatment evaluation. The most common signs of cardiotoxicity were chest pain, ST-T wave changes and atrial fibrillation. This was followed by ventricular fibrillation in one patient and sudden death in another. It is concluded that patients on 5-FU treatment should be under close supervision and that the treatment should be discontinued if chest pain or tachyarrhythmia is observed.

Suxamethonium causes prolonged apnea in patients in whom pseudocholinesterase enzyme gets deactivated by organophosphorus (OP) poisons. Here, we present a similar incident in a severely depressed patient who received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Prolonged apnea in our case ensued because the information about suicidal attempt by OP compound was concealed from the treating team.
Suxamethonium chloride (Sch) was administered i.v. to 36 adult males at six rates: 0.25 mg s-1 to 20 mg s-1. The infusion was discontinued either when there was no muscular response to tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve or when Sch 120 mg was exceeded. Six additional patients received a 30-mg i.v. bolus dose. Fasciculations in six areas of the body were scored from 0 to 3 and summated as a total fasciculation score. The times to first fasciculation, twitch suppression and tetanus suppression were inversely related to the infusion rates. Fasciculations in the six areas and the total fasciculation score were related directly to the rate of infusion. Total fasciculation scores in the 30-mg bolus group and the 5-mg s-1 and 20-mg s-1 infusion groups were not significantly different.

Synapsins are a family of neuron-specific synaptic vesicle-associated phosphoproteins that have been implicated in synaptogenesis and in the modulation of neurotransmitter release. In mammals, distinct genes for synapsins I and II have been identified, each of which gives rise to two alternatively spliced isoforms. We have now cloned and characterized a third member of the synapsin gene family, synapsin III, from human DNA. Synapsin III gives rise to at least one protein isoform, designated synapsin IIIa, in several mammalian species. Synapsin IIIa is associated with synaptic vesicles, and its expression appears to be neuron-specific. The primary structure of synapsin IIIa conforms to the domain model previously described for the synapsin family, with domains A, C, and E exhibiting the highest degree of conservation. Synapsin IIIa contains a novel domain, termed domain J, located between domains C and E. The similarities among synapsins I, II, and III in domain organization, neuron-specific expression, and subcellular localization suggest a possible role for synapsin III in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptogenesis. The human synapsin III gene is located on chromosome 22q12-13, which has been identified as a possible schizophrenia susceptibility locus. On the basis of this localization and the well established neurobiological roles of the synapsins, synapsin III represents a candidate gene for schizophrenia.

Syntaphilin: a syntaxin-1 clamp that controls SNARE assembly.
Syntaxin-1 is a key component of the synaptic vesicle docking/fusion machinery that forms the SNARE complex with VAMP/synaptobrevin and SNAP-25. Identifying proteins that modulate SNARE complex formation is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurotransmitter release and its modulation. We have cloned and characterized a protein called syntaphilin that is selectively expressed in brain. Syntaphilin competes with SNAP-25 for binding to syntaxin-1 and inhibits SNARE complex formation by absorbing free syntaxin-1. Transient overexpression of syntaphilin in cultured hippocampal neurons significantly reduces neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, introduction of syntaphilin into presynaptic superior cervical ganglion neurons in culture inhibits synaptic transmission. These findings suggest that syntaphilin may function as a molecular clamp that controls free syntaxin-1 availability for the assembly of the SNARE complex, and thereby regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis.

Systemic pretreatment with ketanserin, a relatively specific type-2 serotonin receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the muscle rigidity produced in rats by the potent short-acting opiate agonist alfentanil. Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal's left gastrocnemius muscle, rigidity was assessed by analyzing root-mean-square electromyographic activity. Intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the alfentanil-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline. Chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg/kg failed to significantly influence the rigidity produced by alfentanil. Despite the absence of rigidity, animals that received ketanserin (greater than 0.31 mg/kg i.p.) followed by alfentanil were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving alfentanil alone. Rats that received ketanserin and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin alone. These results, in combination with previous work, suggest that muscle rigidity, a clinically relevant side-effect of parenteral narcotic administration, may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways. Pretreatment with type-2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate-induced rigidity, although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression.

T cell-specific Src family tyrosine kinase, p56lck, plays crucial roles in T cell differentiation, activation, and proliferation. These multiple functions of p56lck are believed to be conducted through the protein-protein interactions with various cellular signaling proteins. To clarify the mechanisms through which p56lck contributes to T cell signaling, we identified the proteins binding to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of p56lck through a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent yeast two-hybrid screening. Subsequent characterization of positive clones revealed the presence of a protein of 366 aa named Lad (Lck-associated adapter protein), which is a potential murine homologue of previously reported TSAd, a T cell-specific adapter protein. Lad contains several protein-protein interaction domains including a zinc-finger motif, an SH2 domain, a proline-rich SH3 binding motif, and several phosphotyrosine sites. Furthermore, Lad was tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with p56lck in vivo and redistributed from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in a T cell activation-dependent manner. Moreover in T cells, IL-2 promoter activity was enhanced upon coexpression of Lad but was inhibited by the coexpression of antisense Lad RNA. These characteristics of Lad suggest that Lad play an essential role as an adapter protein in p56lck-mediated T cell signaling.
TAC has been shown to be a potent immunosuppressive agent for solid organ transplantation in pediatrics. Neurotoxicity is a potentially serious toxic effect. It is characterized by encephalopathy, headaches, seizures, or neurological deficits. Here, we describe an eight-and-a-half-yr-old male renal transplant recipient with right BN. MRI demonstrated hyperintense T2 signals in the cervical cord and right brachial plexus roots indicative of both myelitis and right brachial plexitis. Symptoms persisted for three months despite TAC dose reduction, administration of IVIG and four doses of methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Improvement and eventually full recovery only occurred after TAC was completely discontinued and successfully replaced by everolimus.
TACC1-chTOG-Aurora A protein complex in breast cancer.
TCF transcription factors are mediators of the WNT signaling pathway and are antagonized by the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway. Here human TCF-3 has been cloned and characterized. Differential expression analyses of TCF genes in gastric cancer revealed that TCF-1 was expressed in most cases of primary gastric cancer at almost the same level as in normal gastric mucosa and that TCF-3 was occasionally up-regulated in primary gastric cancer. The TCF-3 expression vector was transfected to gastric cancer cell line MKN28 to establish stable transformants. Three independent MKN28 transformants overexpressing TCF-3 showed about 8-fold resistance to mitomycin C (MMC; IC50, 2.4 microg/ml) compared with MKN28 vector transfectants (IC50 = 0.3 microg/ml). Among the 10 drug resistance-associated genes examined in this study, the DT-diaphorase (DTD) gene was down-regulated in three MKN28 transformants overexpressing TCF-3. DTD mRNA was also down-regulated in primary gastric cancer with TCF-3 up-regulation. In addition, DTD protein was down-regulated in three MKN28 transformants overexpressing TCF-3 compared with MKN28 vector transfectants. DTD is implicated in the activation of MMC in target cells, and DTD down-regulation explains MMC resistance. MMC resistance induced by TCF-3 overexpression is probably due to DTD down-regulation, which might provide a possible target for new therapy of drug-resistant gastric cancer.
TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.
TGFbeta signaling is initiated when the type I receptor phosphorylates the MAD-related protein, Smad2, on C-terminal serine residues. This leads to Smad2 association with Smad4, translocation to the nucleus, and regulation of transcriptional responses. Here we demonstrate that Smad7 is an inhibitor of TGFbeta signaling. Smad7 prevents TGFbeta-dependent formation of Smad2/Smad4 complexes and inhibits the nuclear accumulation of Smad2. Smad7 interacts stably with the activated TGFbeta type I receptor, thereby blocking the association, phosphorylation, and activation of Smad2. Furthermore, mutations in Smad7 that interfere with receptor binding disrupt its inhibitory activity. These studies thus define a novel function for MAD-related proteins as intracellular antagonists of the type I kinase domain of TGFbeta family receptors.
TIF1gamma, a novel member of the transcriptional intermediary factor 1 family.
TIRP, a novel Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter protein involved in TIR signaling.
TNF is a proinflammatory cytokine that has pleiotropic effects on cells and tissues, mediated in large part by alterations in target tissue gene expression. We have used the technique of differential hybridization to identify several primary response genes induced by TNF in human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells, a cell type that is profoundly activated by cytokine treatment. One of these cDNA, designated B94, detects a rapidly and transiently induced 4-kb transcript in TNF-treated HUVE cells, and this transcript is superinduced in the concomitant presence of cycloheximide. Other proinflammatory stimuli including IL-1 beta and LPS are also able to induce B94 mRNA expression. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrate that TNF induction of B94 transcript occurs primarily at the level of transcriptional activation. Further, B94 is shown to be a single copy gene that is evolutionarily conserved. The gene is localized to the q32 region of chromosome 14, a region that is often rearranged in lymphoid neoplasms. B94 transcript expression is also found to be regulated during mouse development and in an in vitro model of endothelial capillary tube formation. Developmental regulation occurs most prominently in mouse embryonic liver and kidney, and a second smaller form of B94 transcript is detected in the placenta and testes. B94 and other TNF-responsive transcripts are also induced during capillary tube formation suggesting overlap between genes induced by TNF and those induced during angiogenesis. Sequence analysis of the B94 cDNA reveals an open reading frame encoding a 73-kDa polypeptide that has no homology to any known protein. Polyclonal antisera directed against the carboxyl-terminal portion of the B94 protein immunoprecipitates a protein of the predicted molecular mass both from COS cells transfected with a B94 expression vector and from TNF-treated HUVE cells.
TSG-6 cDNA was isolated by differential screening of a lambda cDNA library prepared from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-treated human diploid FS-4 fibroblasts. We show that TSG-6 mRNA was not detectable in untreated cells, but became readily induced by TNF in normal human fibroblast lines and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, TSG-6 mRNA was undetectable in either control or TNF-treated human vascular endothelial cells and a variety of tumor-derived or virus-transformed cell lines. The sequence of full-length TSG-6 cDNA revealed one major open reading frame predicting a polypeptide of 277 amino acids, including a typical cleavable signal peptide. The NH2-terminal half of the predicted TSG-6 protein sequence shows a significant homology with a region implicated in hyaluronate binding, present in cartilage link protein, proteoglycan core proteins, and the adhesion receptor CD44. The most extensive sequence homology exists between the predicted TSG-6 protein and CD44. Western blot analysis with an antiserum raised against a TSG-6 fusion protein detected a 39-kD glycoprotein in the supernatants of TNF-treated FS-4 cells and of cells transfected with TSG-6 cDNA. Binding of the TSG-6 protein to hyaluronate was demonstrated by coprecipitation. Our data indicate that the inflammatory cytokine (TNF or IL-1)-inducible, secretory TSG-6 protein is a novel member of the family of hyaluronate binding proteins, possibly involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during inflammation and tumorigenesis.
TWIK-related acid-sensitive K(+) (TASK) channels contribute to setting the resting potential of mammalian neurons and have recently been defined as molecular targets for extracellular protons and volatile anesthetics. We have isolated a novel member of this subfamily, hTASK-5, from a human genomic library and mapped it to chromosomal region 20q12-20q13. hTASK-5 did not functionally express in Xenopus oocytes, whereas chimeric TASK-5/TASK-3 constructs containing the region between M1 and M3 of TASK-3 produced K(+) selective currents. To better correlate TASK subunits with native K(+) currents in neurons the precise cellular distribution of all TASK family members was elucidated in rat brain. A comprehensive in situ hybridization analysis revealed that both TASK-1 and TASK-3 transcripts are most strongly expressed in many neurons likely to be cholinergic, serotonergic, or noradrenergic. In contrast, TASK-5 expression is found in olfactory bulb mitral cells and Purkinje cells, but predominantly associated with the central auditory pathway. Thus, TASK-5 K(+) channels, possibly in conjunction with auxiliary proteins, may play a role in the transmission of temporal information in the auditory system.
Tachyphylaxis to systemic but not to airway responses during prolonged therapy with high dose inhaled salbutamol in asthmatics.
Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation. However, adverse effects include cardiac toxicity. Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation. The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography. Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, tacrolimus dosage was reduced. Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy. Thus, we conclude that tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy. In patients receiving tacrolimus therapy, blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement.
Tacrolimus-related seizure after pediatric liver transplantation--a single-center experience.
Taking advantage of the illegitimate transcription of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, we have been able to analyse the PAH cDNA sequence of hyperphenylalaninemic children in circulating lymphocytes. Using this approach, we have also identified 3 novel mutations in cDNA from liver and lymphocytes of two patients. One mutation, detected by the abnormal pattern of migration of an amplified fragment, is a C to T transition in the splice acceptor site of intron 10, which resulted in the skipping of exon 11 with the premature termination of RNA translation downstream from exon 12 (-3 IVS10). The other two mutations are missense mutations in exons 10 and 11 (respectively, L333F and E390G). The present study supports the view that circulating lymphocytes give easy access to PAH gene transcripts whose nucleotide sequence is identical to that reported in liver and therefore represent a useful tool for molecular genetic studies in phenylketonuria..
Takotsubo syndrome (TS), also known as broken heart syndrome, is characterized by left ventricle apical ballooning with elevated cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ie, ST-segment elevation, T wave inversions, and pathologic Q waves). We report a case of 54-year-old woman with medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines, who was admitted to the hospital for substernal chest pain and electrocardiogram demonstrated 1/2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 and positive troponin I. Emergent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS. Detailed history obtained retrospectively revealed that the patient took zolmitriptan sparingly only when she had migraines. But before this event, she was taking zolmitriptan 2-3 times daily for several days because of a persistent migraine headache. She otherwise reported that she is quite active, rides horses, and does show jumping without any limitations in her physical activity. There was no evidence of any recent stress or status migrainosus. Extensive literature search revealed multiple cases of coronary artery vasospasm secondary to zolmitriptan, but none of the cases were associated with TS.
Takotsubo syndrome (or apical ballooning syndrome) secondary to Zolmitriptan.
Tamoxifen (TAM), the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of breast cancer, induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and hemolytic anemia. This work evaluates the effects of TAM on isolated human erythrocytes, attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on TAM-induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms. TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration. The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples, but 12.5 microM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions. Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis, TAM does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes. The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) and alpha-tocopherol acetate (alpha-TAc) (inactivated functional hydroxyl) indicating that TAM-induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage. This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM-induced hemolysis. Furthermore, it was observed that TAM inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH, thus ruling out TAM-induced cell oxidative stress. Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K(+) from the cells, also excluding a colloid-osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis, according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves. However, TAM induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane-cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3. Either alpha-T or alpha-TAc increases membrane packing and prevents TAM partition into model membranes. These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided. Therefore, TAM-induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane, leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane. These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by TAM, resulting in hemolytic anemia. Additionally, since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity, the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by TAM may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action.
Tankyrase 1, a human telomeric poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, was originally identified through its interaction with TRF1, a negative regulator of telomere length. Tankyrase 1 ADP-ribosylates TRF1 in vitro, and its overexpression induces telomere elongation in human cancer cells. In addition to its telomeric localization, tankyrase 1 resides at multiple subcellular sites, suggesting additional functions for this protein. Here we identify TAB182, a novel tankyrase 1-binding protein of 182 kDa. TAB182 displays a complex pattern of subcellular localization. TAB182 localizes to the nucleus in a heterochromatic staining pattern and to the cytoplasm, where it co-stains with the cortical actin network. TAB182 coimmunoprecipitates with tankyrase 1 from human cells and serves as an acceptor of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by tankyrase 1 in vitro. Like TRF1, TAB182 binds to the ankyrin domain (comprising 24 ankyrin repeats) of tankyrase 1. Surprisingly, dissection of this domain reveals multiple discrete and overlapping binding sites for TRF1 and TAB182. Thus, we demonstrate five well conserved ankyrin repeat clusters in tankyrase 1. Although each of the five ankyrin repeat clusters independently binds to TRF1, only three of the five bind toTAB182. These findings suggest that tankyrase 1 may act as a scaffold for large molecular mass complexes made up of multiple binding proteins. We discuss potential roles for tankyrase 1-mediated higher order complexes at telomeres and at other subcellular sites.
Targeted disruption of ATM leads to growth retardation, chromosomal fragmentation during meiosis, immune defects, and thymic lymphoma.
Targeted modification of the apolipoprotein B gene results in hypobetalipoproteinemia and developmental abnormalities in mice.
Targeted mutagenesis was used to produce two mutations in the murine hemochromatosis gene (Hfe) locus. The first mutation deletes a large portion of the coding sequence, generating a null allele. The second mutation introduces a missense mutation (C282Y) into the Hfe locus, but otherwise leaves the gene intact. This mutation is identical to the disease-causing mutation in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. Mice carrying each of the two mutations were bred and analyzed. Homozygosity for either mutation results in postnatal iron loading. The effects of the null mutation are more severe than the effects of the C282Y mutation. Mice heterozygous for either mutation accumulate more iron than normal controls. Interestingly, although liver iron stores are greatly increased, splenic iron is decreased. We conclude that the C282Y mutation does not result in a null allele..
Taxins are a family of centrosomal proteins important for the regulation of mitosis and microtubule dynamics. Cytokinesis, the last step of M phase, is essential for chromosomal integrity and cell division. It is highly regulated and involves a reorganization of microtubules and actin filaments. We show here that TACC1 localizes diffusely to the midzone spindle in anaphase and strongly to the midbody during cytokinesis, indicating a possible involvement of this protein in the exit of M phase. TACC1 also relocalizes to the nucleolus in interphase. We demonstrate that TACC1 and the mitotic kinase Aurora B belong to the same complex during cytokinesis. We further show that Aurora B knocked down by RNA-mediated interference prevents the formation of the midbody - and consequently affects TACC1 localization at this site - and leads to abnormal cell division and multinucleated cells.
Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation of the HEXA gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (Hex A). We have discovered that a Tay-Sachs mutation, IVS-9 + 1 G-- > A, first detected by Akli et al. (Genomics 11 124-134, 1991), is a common disease allele in non-Jewish Caucasians (10/58 alleles examined). A PCR-based diagnostic test, which detects an NlaIII site generated by the mutation, revealed a frequency among enzyme-defined carriers of 9/64 (14%). Most of those carrying the allele trace their origins to the United Kingdom, Ireland, or Western Europe. It was not identified among 12 Black American TSD alleles or in any of 18 Ashkenazi Jewish, enzyme-defined carriers who did not carry any of the mutations common to this population. No normally spliced RNA was detected in PCR products generated from reverse transcription of RNA carrying the IVS-9 mutation. Instead, the low levels of mRNA from this allele were comprised of aberrant species resulting from the use of either of two cryptic donor sites, one truncating exon 9 and the other within IVS-9, spliced to exon 10. Numerous additional splice products were detected, most involving skipping of one or more surrounding exons. Together with a recently identified allele responsible for Hex A pseudodeficiency (Triggs-Raine et al. Am J Hum Genet, 1992), these two alleles accounted for almost 50% (29/64) of TSD or carrier alleles ascertained by enzyme screening tests in non-Jewish Caucasians..
Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation of the HEXA gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (ref. 1). A relatively high frequency of carriers (1/27) of a lethal, infantile form of the disease is found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but it is not yet evident whether this has resulted from a founder effect and random genetic drift or from a selective advantage of heterozygotes. We have identified a single-base mutation in a cloned fragment of the HEXA gene from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient. This change, the substitution of a C for G in the first nucleotide of intron 12 is expected to result in defective splicing of the messenger RNA. A test for the mutant allele based on amplification of DNA by the polymerase chain rection and cleavage of a DdeI restriction site generated by the mutation revealed that this case and two other cases of the Ashkenazi, infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease are heterozygous for two different mutations. The occurrence of multiple mutant alleles warrants further examination of the selective advantage hypothesis..

Temporal and parental-specific expression of imprinted genes in a newly derived Chinese human embryonic stem cell line and embryoid bodies.
Ten patients who had Parkinson's disease with disabling dyskinesia were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental (mental calculation) and motor (flexion/extension of right fingers, flexion/extension of left fingers, flexion/extension of the neck, speaking aloud) tasks on the worsening of peak-dose dyskinesia following administration of an effective single dose of apomorphine. Compared with the score at rest (1.3+/-0.3), a significant aggravation of the dyskinesia score was observed during speaking aloud (5.2+/-1.1, p<0.05), movements of right (4.5+/-1.0, p<0.05) and left (3.7+/-0.8, p<0.05) fingers, movements of the neck (5.1+/-1.0, p<0.05), and mental calculation (3.1+/-1.0, p<0.05). These results suggest that activation tasks such as "speaking aloud" could be used for objective assessment of dyskinesia severity.
Ten variants of erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were identified in 22 patients with G6PD deficiency from three districts of Bulgaria. Corinth-like and Fayoum-like variants were the most frequent; Mediterranean, Ohut II, Kilgore, Boston, Poznan, and Panay variants and two new variants, Petrich and Gotze Delchev, were each found in one or two carriers. No correlation was revealed between clinical and biochemical polymorphism..
Terminal complement component deficiency predisposes to meningococcal infection and is inherited in an autosomal co-dominant manner. An Irish family is described, in which 2 of 3 brothers had recurrent meningococcal infection. A novel screening assay was used to investigate for terminal complement deficiency and the 2 affected brothers were found to be completely deficient in the seventh component of complement (C7). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for C7 revealed lower than normal levels in the remaining brother and parents. C7 M/N protein polymorphism allotyping, used to investigate the segregation of the C7 deficiency genes, showed that the apparently complement sufficient brother was heterozygous C7 deficient and a carrier of one of the deficiency genes. Complement screening should be carried out in any individual suffering recurrent meningococcal infection or infection with an uncommon meningococcal serogroup. Identification of complement deficient patients allows the implementation of strategies to prevent recurrent infection..

Tetany and rhabdomyolysis due to surreptitious furosemide--importance of magnesium supplementation.
Tetrandrine (TET) and fangchinoline (FAN) are two naturally occurring analogues with a bisbenzylisoquinoline structure. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of TET and FAN on the experimental thrombosis induced by collagen plus epinephrine (EP) in mice, and platelet aggregation and blood coagulation in vitro. In the in vivo study, the administration (50 mg/kg, i.p.) of TET and FAN in mice showed the inhibition of thrombosis by 55% and 35%, respectively, while acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 50 mg/kg, i.p.), a positive control, showed only 30% inhibition. In the vitro human platelet aggregations induced by the agonists used in tests, TET and FAN showed the inhibitions dose dependently. In addition, neither TET nor FAN showed any anticoagulation activities in the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT) using human-citrated plasma. These results suggest that antithrombosis of TET and FAN in mice may be mainly related to the antiplatelet aggregation activities.
Thalidomide and sensory neurotoxicity: a neurophysiological study.
Thalidomide has limited single-agent activity in relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas: a phase II trial of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B.
Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with demonstrated activity in multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Its activity is believed to be due modulation of the tumour milieu, including downregulation of angiogenesis and inflammatory cytokines. Between July 2001 and April 2004, 24 patients with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphomas received thalidomide 200 mg daily with escalation by 100 mg daily every 1-2 weeks as tolerated, up to a maximum of 800 mg daily. Patients had received a median of 2 (range, 1-4) prior regimens. Of 24 evaluable patients, two achieved a complete remission and one achieved a partial remission for an overall response rate of 12.5% (95% confidence interval: 2.6-32.4%). Eleven patients progressed during therapy. Grade 3-4 adverse effects included myelosuppression, fatigue, somnolence/depressed mood, neuropathy and dyspnea. Of concern was the occurrence of four thromboembolic events. Our results failed to demonstrate an important response rate to single agent thalidomide in indolent lymphomas and contrast with the higher activity level reported with the second generation immunomodulatory agent, lenalidomide.

The "Osteopetroses" are genetic diseases whose clinical picture is caused by a defect in bone resorption by osteoclasts. Three main forms can be distinguished on the basis of severity, age of onset and means of inheritance: the dominant benign, the intermediate and the recessive severe form. While several genes have been involved in the pathogenesis of the different types of osteopetroses, the CLCN7 gene has drawn the attention of many researchers, as mutations within this gene are associated with very different phenotypes. We report here the characterization of 25 unpublished patients which has resulted in the identification of 20 novel mutations, including 11 missense mutations, 6 causing premature termination, 1 small deletion and 2 putative splice site defects. Careful analysis of clinical and molecular data led us to several conclusions. First, intermediate osteopetrosis is not homogeneous, since it can comprise both severe dominant forms with an early onset and recessive ones without central nervous system involvement. Second, the appropriateness of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in CLCN7-dependent ARO patients has to be carefully evaluated and exhaustive CNS examination is strongly suggested, as transplantation can almost completely cure the disease in situations where no primary neurological symptoms are present. Finally, the analysis of this largest cohort of CLCN7-dependent ARO patients together with some ADO II families allowed us to draw preliminary genotype-phenotype correlations suggesting that haploinsufficiency is not the mechanism causing ADO II. The availability of biochemical assays to characterize ClC-7 function will help to confirm this hypothesis.
The 14 exons of the PAX6 gene have been analysed exon-by-exon using SSCP in 6 aniridia families. In each family band shifts were observed on the SSCP gels for only one exon and direct PCR-sequencing revealed mutations in each case. Two mutations involved C-- > T transitions in CGAarg codons in exons 9 and 11. Another C-- > T transition converted a CAG-glutamine to a TAG-stop in exon 7. Small insertions created frameshifts which produced downstream stop codons in another two patients and an A-- > T mutation disrupted the splice donor site of exon 5 in the remaining family. Thus, complete inactivation of the PAX6 gene is predicted in all cases. Analysis of other affected members of the families showed that, in each case, all affected individuals carried the same family-specific mutation. One polymorphism was found in exon 7. This data strongly supports the candidature of PAX6 as the gene responsible for hereditary aniridia..
The 185delAG BRCA1 mutation originated before the dispersion of Jews in the diaspora and is not limited to Ashkenazim.
The 185delAG mutation in BRCA1 is detected in Ashkenazi Jews both in familial breast and ovarian cancer and in the general population. All tested Ashkenazi mutation carriers share the same allelic pattern at the BRCA1 locus. Our previous study showed that this Ashkenazi mutation also occurs in Iraqi Jews with a similar allelic pattern. We extended our analysis to other non-Ashkenazi subsets 354 of Moroccan origin, 200 Yemenites and 150 Iranian Jews. Heteroduplex analysis complemented by direct DNA sequencing of abnormally migrating bands were employed. Four of Moroccan origin (1. 1%) and none of the Yemenites or Iranians was a carrier of the 185delAG mutation. BRCA1 allelic patterns were determined for four of these individuals and for 12 additional non-Ashkenazi 185delAG mutation carriers who had breast/ovarian cancer. Six non-Ashkenazi individuals shared the common Ashkenazi haplotype, four had a closely related pattern, and the rest (n = 6) displayed a distinct BRCA1 allelic pattern. We conclude that the 185delAG BRCA1 mutation occurs in some non-Ashkenazi populations at rates comparable with that of Ashkenazim. The majority of Jewish 185delAG mutation carriers have a common allelic pattern, supporting the founder effect notion, but dating the mutations origin to an earlier date than currently estimated. However, the different allelic pattern at the BRCA1 locus even in some Jewish mutation carriers, might suggest that the mutation arose independently..
The 3' poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNAs plays an important role in the regulation of translation. The poly(A) binding protein (PABP) interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), a component of the eIF4F complex, which binds to the 5' cap structure. The PABP-eIF4G interaction brings about the circularization of the mRNA by joining its 5' and 3' termini, thereby stimulating mRNA translation. The activity of PABP is regulated by two interacting proteins, Paip1 and Paip2. To study the mechanism of the Paip1-PABP interaction, far-Western, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, and surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed. Paip1 contains two binding sites for PABP, PAM1 and PAM2 (for PABP-interacting motifs 1 and 2). PAM2 consists of a 15-amino-acid stretch residing in the N terminus, and PAM1 encompasses a larger C-terminal acidic-amino-acid-rich region. PABP also contains two Paip1 binding sites, one located in RNA recognition motifs 1 and 2 and the other located in the C-terminal domain. Paip1 binds to PABP with a 1:1 stoichiometry and an apparent K(d) of 1.9 nM.

The 620W allele of PTPN22 has been associated with susceptibility to several different forms of chronic inflammatory disease, including Type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). We set out to explore its possible role in two other inflammatory diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS) and Crohn's disease (CD). In our cohort of 496 MS trios from the United Kingdom, we observed reduced transmission of the PTPN22 620W allele. The CD sample consisted of 169 trios as well as 249 cases of CD with their 207 matched control subjects collected in the province of Quebec, Canada; there was also no evidence of association between the PTPN22 620W allele and susceptibility for CD. Pooled analyses combining our data with published data assessed a total of 1496 cases of MS and 1019 cases of CD but demonstrated no evidence of association with either disease. Given the modest odds ratios of known risk alleles for inflammatory diseases, these analyses do not exclude a role for the PTPN22 allele in susceptibility to CD or MS, but they do suggest that such a putative role would probably be more modest than that reported so far in T1D, RA, SLE, and AIT.
The 999del5 mutation is the single, strong BRCA2 founder mutation in Iceland and the most common BRCA1/2 founder mutation in Finland. To evaluate the origin and time since spreading of the 999del5 mutation in Iceland and in Finland, we constructed haplotypes with polymorphic markers within and flanking the BRCA2 gene in a set of 18 Icelandic and 10 Finnish 999del5 breast cancer families. All Icelandic families analysed shared a common core haplotype of about 1.7 cM. The common ancestors for the Icelandic families studied were estimated to trace back to 340-1000 years, not excluding the possibility that the mutation was brought to Iceland during the settlement of the country. Analysis of the Finnish families revealed two distinct haplotypes. A rare one, found in three families in the old settlement region in southwestern Finland, shared a four-marker (0.5 cM) core haplotype with the Icelandic 999del5 haplotype. A distinct approximately 6 cM haplotype was shared by seven 999del5 Finnish families estimated to have a common ancestry 140-300 years ago. These families cluster in two geographical regions in Finland, in the very same area as those with the rare haplotype and also in the most eastern, late settlement region of Finland. The results may indicate a common ancient origin for the 999del5 mutation in Iceland and in Finland, but distinct mutational events cannot be ruled out. The surprising finding of the same mutation in two completely different haplotypes in a sparsely populated area in Finland may suggest gene conversion.
The AMELX gene located at Xp22. 1-p22. 3 encodes for the enamel protein amelogenin and has been implicated as the gene responsible for the inherited dental abnormality X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta (XAI). Three families with XAI have been investigated using polymorphic DNA markers flanking the position of AMELX. Using two-point linkage analysis, linkage was established between XAI and several of these markers in two families, with a combined lod score of 6. 05 for DXS16 at theta = 0. 04 04. This supports the involvement of AMELX, located close to DXS16, in the XAI disease process (AIH1) in those families. Using multipoint linkage analysis, the combined maximum lod score for these two families was 7. 30 for a location of AIH1 at 2 cM distal to DXS16. The support interval around this location extended about 8 cM proximal to DXS92, and the AIH1 location could not be precisely defined by multipoint mapping. Study of recombination events indicated that AIH1 lies in the interval between DXS143 and DXS85. There was significant evidence against linkage to this region in the third family, indicating locus heterogeneity in XAI. Further analysis with markers on the long arm of the X chromosome showed evidence of linkage to DXS144E and F9 with no recombination with either of these markers. Two-point analysis gave a peak lod score at DXS144E with a maximum lod score of 2. 83 at theta = 0, with a peak lod score in multipoint linkage analysis of 2. 84 at theta = 0. The support interval extended 9 cM proximal to DXS144E and 14 cM distal to F9. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).

The ARP gene encodes a highly conserved arginine-rich protein from chromosomal band 3p21. 1 1. At the cytogenetic level this region is frequently deleted in a variety of different solid tumors, although not in pancreatic cancer. We have reported the presence of a specific mutation (ATG50-- > AGG) or deletion of codon 50 of the ARP gene in different tumor types (Shridhar et al., 1996, 1996a). In the present study, we have observed mutations involving codon 50 in 11 of 37 pancreatic tumors. The frequency of codon 50 mutation is roughly the same in pancreatic tumors as in the other types of tumors previously examined. In addition, we have detected mutations at codon 51 in multiple PCR subclones in two other pancreatic tumors. Mutations in the ARP gene are thus commonly observed in pancreatic cancer, as well as many other cancers.
The ATM (A-T, mutated) gene on human chromosome 11q22. 3 has recently been identified as the gene responsible for the human recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). In order to define the types of disease-causing ATM mutations in Japanese A-T patients as well as to look for possible mutational hotspots, reverse-transcribed RNA derived from ten patients belonging to eight unrelated Japanese A-T families was analyzed for mutations by the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting method. As has been reported by others, mutations that lead to exon skipping or premature protein truncation were also predominant in our mutants. Six different mutations were identified on 12 of the 16 alleles examined. Four were deletions involving a loss of a single exon exon 7, exon 16, exon 33 or exon 35. The others were minute deletions, 4649delA in exon 33 and 7883del5 in exon 55. The mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5 were found in more than two unrelated families; 44% (7 of 16) of the mutant alleles had one of the two mutations. The 4612del165 mutations in three different families were all ascribed to the same T-- > A substitution at the splice donor site in intron 33. Microsatellite genotyping around the ATM locus also indicated that a common haplotype was shared by the mutant alleles in both mutations. This suggests that these two founder mutations may be predominant among Japanese ATM mutant alleles.
The ATM gene is responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), characterized by cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition. A-T carriers were reported to be moderately cancer-prone. A wide variety of A-T mutations, most of which are unique to single families, were identified in various ethnic groups, precluding carrier screening with mutation-specific assays. However, a single mutation was observed in 32/33 defective ATM alleles in Jewish A-T families of North African origin, coming from various regions of Morocco and Tunisia. This mutation, 103C-- > T, results in a stop codon at position 35 of the ATM protein. In keeping with the nature of this mutation, various antibodies directed against the ATM protein failed to defect this protein in patient cells. A rapid carrier detection assay detected this mutation in three out of 488 ATM alleles of Jewish Moroccan or Tunisian origin. This founder effect provides a unique opportunity for population-based screening for A-T carriers in a large Jewish community..
The AVIT protein family. Secreted cysteine-rich vertebrate proteins with diverse functions.
The Ah (dioxin) receptor binds a number of widely disseminated environmental pollutants, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and mediates their carcinogenic effects. The ligand-bound receptor activates Cyp 1a1 gene transcription through interaction with specific DNA sequences, termed xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs). The Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein (Arnt) is required for Ah receptor function. Arnt is now shown to be a structural component of the XRE binding form of the Ah receptor. Furthermore, Arnt and the ligand-binding subunit of the receptor were extracted as a complex from the nuclei of cells treated with ligand. Arnt contains a basic helix-loop-helix motif, which may be responsible for interacting with both the XRE and the ligand-binding subunit.
The Atp7b protein is a copper-transporting ATPase expressed predominantly in the liver and to a lesser extent in most other tissues. Mutations in the ATP7B gene lead to Wilson disease, a copper toxicity disorder characterized by dramatic build-up of intracellular hepatic copper with subsequent hepatic and neuro-logical abnormalities. Using homologous recombination to disrupt the normal translation of ATP7B, we have generated a strain of mice that are homozygous mutants (null) for the Wilson disease gene. The ATP7B null mice display a gradual accumulation of hepatic copper that increases to a level 60-fold greater than normal by 5 months of age. An increase in copper concentration was also observed in the kidney, brain, placenta and lactating mammary glands of homo-zygous mutants, although milk from the mutant glands was copper deficient. Morphological abnormalities resembling cirrhosis developed in the majority of the livers from homozygous mutants older than 7 months of age. Progeny of the homozygous mutant females demonstrated neurological abnormalities and growth retardation characteristic of copper deficiency. Copper concentration in the livers of the newborn homozygous null mutants was decreased dramatically. In summary, inactivation of the murine ATP7B gene produces a form of cirrhotic liver disease that resembles Wilson disease in humans and the toxic milk phenotype in the mouse..
The BRCA1 gene is in large part responsible for hereditary human breast and ovarian cancer. Here we report the isolation of the murine Brca1 homologue cDNA clones. In addition, we identified genomic P1 clones that contain most, if not all, of the mouse Brca1 locus. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the mouse and human coding regions are 75% identical at the nucleotide level while the predicted amino acid identity is only 58%. A DNA sequence variant in the Brca1 locus was identified and used to map this gene on a (Mus m. musculus Czech II x C57BL/KsJ) F1 x C57BL/KsJ intersubspecific backcross to distal mouse chromosome 11. The mapping of this gene to a region highly syntenic with human chromosome 17, coupled with Southern and Northern analyses, confirms that we isolated the murine Brca1 homologue rather than a related RING finger gene. The isolation of the mouse Brca1 homologue will facilitate the creation of mouse models for germline BRCA1 defects..
The BRCA1 gene on chromosome 17q21 is responsible for an autosomal dominant syndrome of increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer but no somatic mutations in tumours have yet been described. To study the potential role of BRCA1 in sporadic carcinogenesis, we analysed the genomic DNA of tumour and normal fractions of 47 ovarian cancers for mutations in BRCA1 using the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. We now describe somatic mutations in the DNA of four tumours which also had loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at a BRCA1 intragenic marker. Our data support a tumour suppressor mechanism for BRCA1; somatic mutations and LOH may result in inactivation of BRCA1 in at least a small number of ovarian cancers..
The BRCA1 gene product was identified as a 220-kilodalton nuclear phosphoprotein in normal cells, including breast ductal epithelial cells, and in 18 of 20 tumor cell lines derived from tissues other than breast and ovary. In 16 of 17 breast and ovarian cancer lines and 17 of 17 samples of cells obtained from malignant effusions, however, BRCA1 localized mainly in cytoplasm. Absence of BRCA1 or aberrant subcellular location was also observed to a variable extent in histological sections of many breast cancer biopsies. These findings suggest that BRCA1 abnormalities may be involved in the pathogenesis of many breast cancers, sporadic as well as familial..
The Bmx sequence was identified and cloned during our search for novel tyrosine kinase genes expressed in human bone marrow cells. Bmx cDNA comprises a long open reading frame of 675 amino acids, containing one SH3, one SH2 and one tyrosine kinase domain, which are about 70% identical with Btk, Itk and Tec and somewhat less with Txk tyrosine kinase sequences. The amino terminal sequences of these four tyrosine kinases are about 40% identical and each contains a so-called pleckstrin homology domain. The 2.7 kb Bmx mRNA was expressed in endothelial cells and several human tissues by Northern blotting and an 80 kD Bmx polypeptide was detected in human endothelial cells. Immunoprecipitates of COS cells transfected with a Bmx expression vector and NIH3T3 cells expressing a Bmx retrovirus contained a tyrosyl phosphorylated Bmx polypeptide of similar molecular weight. The BMX gene was located in chromosomal band Xp22.2 between the DXS197 and DXS207 loci. Interestingly, chromosome X also contains the closest relative of BMX, the BTK gene, implicated in X-linked agammaglobulinemia. The BMX gene thus encodes a novel nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, which may play a role in the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells.

The CFTR mutations in cystic fibrosis (CF) lead to ion transport anomalities which predispose to chronic infection and inflammation of CF airways as the major determinants for morbidity and mortality in CF. Discordant clinical phenotypes of siblings with identical CFTR mutations and the large variability of clinical manifestations of patients who are homozygous for the most common mutation F508del suggest that both environment and genes other than CFTR contribute substantially to CF disease. The prime candidates for genetic modifiers in CF are elements of host defence such as the TNFalpha receptor and of ion transport such as the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel ENaC, both of which are encoded side by side on 12p13 (TNFRSF1A, SCNN1A) and 16p12 (SCNN1B, SCNN1G). Thirty-seven families with F508del-CFTR homozygous siblings exhibiting extreme clinical phenotypes that had been selected from the 467 pairs of the European CF Twin and Sibling Study were genotyped at 12p13 and 16p12 markers. The ENaC was identified as a modulator of CF by transmission disequilibrium at SCNN1G and association with CF phenotype intrapair discordance at SCNN1B. Family-based and case-control analyses and sequencing of SCNN1A and TNFRSF1A uncovered an association of the TNFRSF1A intron 1 haplotype with disease severity. Carriers of risk haplotypes were underrepresented suggesting a strong impact of both loci on survival. The finding that TNFRSF1A, SCNN1B and SCNN1G are clinically relevant modulators of CF disease supports current concepts that the depletion of airway surface liquid and inadequate host inflammatory responses trigger pulmonary disease in CF.
The COL3A1 Alu insertion is a member of the AluY subfamily. It has been found to be absent in non-human primates and polymorphic in worldwide human populations. The integration of the element into the human genome seems to have preceded the initial migration(s) of anatomically modern humans out of the African continent. Although the insertion has been detected in populations from all the continents, its highest frequency values are located within sub-Saharan Africa. The sequence alignment of the COL3A1 insertion from several African individuals revealed a bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the downstream terminus of the element's poly-A tract. Once discovered, a selective PCR procedure was designed to determine the frequency of both alleles in 19 worldwide populations. The A-allele in this binary SNP experiences a clinal increase in the eastward direction from Africa to Southeast Asia and Mongolia, reaching fixation in the two latter regions. The T variant, on the other hand, exhibits a westward clinal increase outside of Africa, with its lowest frequency in Asia and achieving fixation in northern Europe. The presence of this internal SNP extends the usefulness provided by the polymorphic Alu insertion (PAI). It is possible that superimposing polymorphisms like this one found in the COL3A1 locus may accentuate signals from genetic drift events allowing for visualization of recent dispersal patterns.
The COUP (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter) transcription factor (COUP-TF) exists in a number of different tissues and is essential for expression of the chicken ovalbumin gene. It binds to the ovalbumin promoter and, in conjunction with a second protein (S300-II), stimulates initiation of transcription in vitro. COUP-TF also binds specifically to the rat insulin promoter element, although the two binding sites share little sequence similarity. Here we report the isolation of a human complementary DNA clone encoding COUP-TF. Comparison of the amino-acid sequence of COUP-TF with known sequences reveals that it is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone/vitamin receptor superfamily. Consequently, it is the first member of this family that has been shown to function in a cell-free transcription system. We conclude that this superfamily of gene regulators contains proteins which bind and activate distal promoter elements of eukaryotic genes.

The Denys-Drash syndrome is characterised by a typical nephropathy, genital abnormalities and also predisposes to the development of Wilms tumor. These patients eventually go into end stage renal failure. A candidate Wilms tumor gene, WT1, from the 11p13 chromosome region has recently been cloned. We have analysed the DNA sequence in constitutional cells from eight patients and have shown heterozygous mutations in six of them. Four of the mutations were in exon 9, all resulting in missense mutations. Three were at nucleotide position 1180 resulting in an arg > trp amino acid change. The other was at position 1186 converting an asp > asn in the predicted resultant protein. One patient had a missense mutation in exon 8, converting an arg > his. A single base pair insertion at nucleotide position 821 in exon 6 resulted in the generation of a premature stop codon in the last patient. We were unable to find a mutation in one patient despite complete sequencing of the genomic sequence of the gene. The last patient carried a constitutional deletion of the 11p13 region and no additional mutation was found. There was no obvious correlation between the type of mutation and phenotypic expression. These results further demonstrate that the WT1 gene is important in both the development of the kidney and the genito-urinary system..
The Dhm1 gene is the mouse homologue of the dhp1(+) gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is involved in homologous recombination and RNA metabolism, such as RNA synthesis and RNA trafficking, in S. pombe. Complementation analysis showed the Dhm1 gene on a multicopy plasmid can rescue the temperature-sensitivity mutation of dhp1(ts) and the lethality of the dhp1 null mutation. This finding suggests that Dhm1 has a function in mouse similar to that of dhp1(+). The human homologue of this gene, XRN2, has been identified. A 3.6-kb transcript of XRN2 was detected in 16 tissues examined and was more abundant in testis. By radiation hybrid panel mapping, the XRN2 gene was localized to chromosome 20p11.1-p11.2 between markers D20S180 and D20S871. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.
The Drosophila melanogaster protein sprouty is induced upon fibroblast growth factor (FGF)- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor tyrosine kinase activation and acts as an inhibitor of the ras/MAP kinase pathway downstream of these receptors. By differential display RT-PCR of activated vs. resting umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs) we detected a new human sprouty gene, which we designated human sprouty 4 (hspry4) based on its homology with murine sprouty 4. Hspry4 is widely expressed and Northern blots indicate that different isoforms of hspry4 are induced upon cellular activation. The hspry4 gene maps to 5q31.3. It encodes a protein of 322 amino acids, which, in support of a modulating role in signal transduction, contains a prototypic cysteine-rich region, three, potentially Src homology 3 (SH3) binding, proline-rich regions and a PEST sequence. This new sprouty orthologue can suppress the insulin- and EGF-receptor transduced MAP kinase signaling pathway, but fails to inhibit MAP kinase activation by constitutively active V12 ras. Hspry4 appears to impair the formation of active GTP-ras and exert its activity at the level of wild-type ras or upstream thereof. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, using hspry4 as bait, testicular protein kinase 1 (TESK1) was identified from a human fetal liver cDNA library as a partner of hspry4. The hspry4-TESK1 interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments and increases by growth factor stimulation. The two proteins colocalize in apparent cytoplasmic vesicles and do not show substantial translocation to the plasma membrane upon receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation.
The Drosophila retinal-specific protein, TRP (transient receptor potential), is the founding member of a family of store-operated channels (SOCs) conserved from C. elegans to humans. In vitro studies indicate that TRP is a SOC, but that the related retinal protein, TRPL, is constitutively active. In the current work, we report that coexpression of TRP and TRPL leads to a store-operated, outwardly rectifying current distinct from that owing to either TRP or TRPL alone. TRP and TRPL interact directly, indicating that the TRP-TRPL-dependent current is mediated by heteromultimeric association between the two subunits. We propose that the light-activated current in photoreceptor cells is produced by a combination of TRP homo- and TRP-TRPL heteromultimers.
The E48 antigen, a putative human homologue of the 20-kD protein present in desmosomal preparations of bovine muzzle, and formerly called desmoglein III (dg4), is a promising target antigen for antibody-based therapy of squamous cell carcinoma in man. To anticipate the effect of high antibody dose treatment, and to evaluate the possible biological involvement of the antigen in carcinogenesis, we set out to molecularly characterize the antigen. A cDNA clone encoding the E48 antigen was isolated by expression cloning in COS cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the clone contained an open reading frame of 128 amino acids, encoding a core protein of 13,286 kD. Database searching showed that the E48 antigen has a high level of sequence similarity with the mouse ThB antigen, a member of the Ly-6 antigen family. Phosphatidylinositol-specific (PI-specific) phospholipase-C treatment indicated that the E48 antigen is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPI-anchored) to the plasma membrane. The gene encoding the E48 antigen is a single copy gene, located on human chromosome 8 in the 8q24-qter region. The expression of the gene is confined to keratinocytes and squamous tumor cells. The putative mouse homologue, the ThB antigen, originally identified as an antigen on cells of the lymphocyte lineage, was shown to be highly expressed in squamous mouse epithelia. Moreover, the ThB expression level is in keratinocytes, in contrast to that in lymphocytes, not mouse strain related. Transfection of mouse SV40-polyoma transformed mouse NIH/3T3 cells with the E48 cDNA confirmed that the antigen is likely to be involved in cell-cell adhesion.
The ETS family of proteins is a large group of transcription factors implicated in many aspects of normal hematopoietic development, as well as oncogenesis. For example, the TEL1/ETV6 (TEL1) gene is required for normal yolk sac angiogenesis, adult bone marrow hematopoiesis, and is rearranged or deleted in numerous leukemias. This report describes the cloning and characterization of a novel ETS gene that is highly related to TEL1 and is therefore called TEL2. The TEL2 gene consists of 8 exons spanning approximately 21 kilobases (kb) in human chromosome 6p21. Unlike the ubiquitously expressed TEL1 gene, however, TEL2 appears to be expressed predominantly in hematopoietic tissues. Antibodies raised against the C-terminus of the TEL2 protein were used to show that TEL2 localizes to the nucleus. All ETS proteins can bind DNA via the highly conserved ETS domain, which recognizes a purine-rich DNA sequence with a GGAA core motif. DNA binding assays show that TEL2 can bind the same consensus DNA binding sequence recognized by TEL1/ETV6. Additionally, the TEL2 protein is capable of associating with itself and with TEL1 in doubly transfected Hela cells, and this interaction is mediated through the pointed (PNT) domain of TEL1. The striking similarities of TEL2 to the oncogenic TEL1, its expression in hematopoietic tissues, and its ability to associate with TEL1 suggest that TEL2 may be an important hematopoietic regulatory protein.
The EVI1 gene, located at chromosome band 3q26, is overexpressed in some myeloid leukemia patients with breakpoints either 5' of the gene in the t(3;3)(q21;q26) or 3' of the gene in the inv(3)(q21q26). EVI1 is also expressed as part of a fusion transcript with the transcription factor AML1 in the t(3;21)(q26;q22), associated with myeloid leukemia. In cells with t(3;21), additional fusion transcripts are AML1-MDS1 and AML1-MDS1-EVI1. MDS1 is located at 3q26 170-400 kb upstream (telomeric) of EVI1 in the chromosomal region in which some of the breakpoints 5' of EVI1 have been mapped. MDS1 has been identified as a single gene as well as a previously unreported exon(s) of EVI1 We have analyzed the relationship between MDS1 and EVI1 to determine whether they are two separate genes. In this report, we present evidence indicating that MDS1 exists in normal tissues both as a unique transcript and as a normal fusion transcript with EVI1, with an additional 188 codons at the 5' end of the previously reported EVI1 open reading frame. This additional region has about 40% homology at the amino acid level with the PR domain of the retinoblastoma-interacting zinc-finger protein RIZ. These results are important in view of the fact that EVI1 and MDS1 are involved in leukemia associated with chromosomal translocation breakpoints in the region between these genes.
The EWS gene has been identified based on its location at the chromosome 22 breakpoint of the t (11; 22) (q24; q12) translocation that characterizes Ewing sarcoma and related neuroectodermal tumors. The EWS gene spans about 40 kb of DNA and is encoded by 17 exons. The nucleotide sequence of the exons is identical to that of the previously described cDNA. The first 7 exons encode the N-terminal domain of EWS, which consists of a repeated degenerated polypeptide of 7 to 12 residues rich in tyrosine, serine, threonine, glycine, and glutamine. Exons 11, 12, and 13 encode the putative RNA binding domain. The three glycine- and arginine-rich motifs of the gene are mainly encoded by exons 8-9, 14, and 16. The DNA sequence in the 5 region of the gene has features of a CpG-rich island and lacks canonical promoter elements, such as TATA and CCAAT consensus sequences. Positions of the chromosome 22 breakpoints were determined for 19 Ewing tumors. They were localized in introns 7 or 8 in 18 cases and in intron 10 in 1 case..
The EWS gene, involved in Ewing family of tumors, malignant melanoma of soft parts and desmoplastic small round cell tumors, codes for an RNA binding protein with novel regulatory domains.
The EWS gene, which maps to band q12 of human chromosome 22, is involved in a wide variety of human solid tumors including Ewing sarcoma, related primitive neuroectodermal tumors, malignant melanoma of soft parts and desmoplastic small round cell tumors. In these tumors, the EWS is fused to genes encoding transcriptional activators/repressors, like Fli-1 or erg or ATF 1 or wt1. To better understand the function of the EWS protein, we cloned the EWS cDNA. Sequence analysis of this cDNA revealed differential splicing involving two exons encoding 72 amino acids. Both alternatively spliced transcripts, EWS and EWS-b, are expressed in a variety of cells. Because EWS proteins contain putative conserved RNA binding motifs, we studied the RNA binding properties of the EWS protein. The EWS-b protein binds to RNA in vitro and, specifically, to poly G and poly U. The RNA binding activity was localized to the carboxy terminal 86 amino acids, which constitute RGG box. Thus the amino terminal domain of EWS (NTD-EWS), which is involved in chromosome translocation may regulate the specificity of RNA binding activity of EWS. An EWS-erg chimeric protein, which is found in Ewings sarcoma cells, functions as a transcriptional activator. Mutational analysis of EWS-erg chimeric protein revealed that NTD-EWS functions as a regulatory domain for the transcriptional activation properties of EWS-erg chimeric protein..
The Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy protein, emerin, is a nuclear membrane protein.
The Eph family of receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) is the largest family of RPTKs. The signal transduction pathways initiated by this family have only recently begun to be explored. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify molecules that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of Eck, it was previously shown that activated Eck RPTK bound to and stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pandey, A., Lazar, D.F., Saltiel, A. R., and Dixit, V.M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 30154-30157). Also isolated from this same screen was a novel protein containing SH3 and SH2 adapter modules that had striking homology to those found in the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. However, unlike other Src family members, it lacked a catalytic tyrosine kinase domain. Hence, this protein was designated SLAP for Src-like adapter protein. Using glutathione S-transferase fusion Proteins, it was demonstrated that SLAP bound to activated Eck receptor tyrosine kinase. Therefore, SLAP is a novel candidate downstream signaling intermediate and the first member of the Src family that resembles an adapter molecule.
The Escherichia coli AlkB protein is involved in protecting cells against mutation and cell death induced specifically by SN2-type alkylating agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). A human cDNA encoding a polypeptide homologous to E.coli AlkB was discovered by searching a database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from high throughput cDNA sequencing. The full-length human AlkB homolog (hABH) cDNA clone contains a 924 bp open reading frame encoding a 34 kDa protein which is 52% similar and 23% identical to E.coli AlkB. The hABH gene, which maps to chromosome 14q24, was ubiquitously expressed in 16 human tissues examined. When hABH was expressed in E.coli alkB mutant cells partial rescue of the cells from MMS-induced cell death occurred. Under the conditions used expression of hABH in skin fibroblasts was not regulated by treatment with MMS. Our findings show that the AlkB protein is structurally and functionally conserved from bacteria to human, but its regulation may have diverged during evolution.
The Expressed Sequence Tag database has been searched for examples of previously undescribed human Alpha class glutathione transferases. An incomplete transcript of the previously described GSTA3 gene was identified in a cDNA library derived from 8-9 week placenta. This indicates that the GSTA3 gene is functional and is possibly under specific developmental regulation. A second cDNA, termed GSTA4, was identified in a brain cDNA library. The encoded GSTA4-4 enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and was found to be immunologically distinct from GSTA1-1 and to have high activity with alk-2-enals. Although GSTA4-4 appears to be functionally similar to the mouse GST5.7 and rat GST8-8 Alpha class enzymes, sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis suggest that GSTA4-4 may be a member of a distinct Alpha class subgroup.
The FH mutation database: an online database of fumarate hydratase mutations involved in the MCUL (HLRCC) tumor syndrome and congenital fumarase deficiency.
The Fanconi anaemia (FA) nuclear complex (composed of the FA proteins A, C, G and F) is essential for protection against chromosome breakage. It activates the downstream protein FANCD2 by monoubiquitylation; this then forges an association with the BRCA1 protein at sites of DNA damage. Here we show that the recently identified FANCE protein is part of this nuclear complex, binding both FANCC and FANCD2. Indeed, FANCE is required for the nuclear accumulation of FANCC and provides a critical bridge between the FA complex and FANCD2. Disease-associated FANCC mutants do not bind to FANCE, cannot accumulate in the nucleus and are unable to prevent chromosome breakage.
The Fanconi anemia protein FANCF forms a nuclear complex with FANCA, FANCC and FANCG.
The G protein-coupled CXC-chemokine receptor CXCR-2 mediates activation of neutrophil effector functions in response to multiple ligands, including IL-8 and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2). Although CXCR-2 has been successfully cloned and expressed in several cell lines, the molecular properties of the native neutrophil-expressed receptor have remained largely undefined. Here we report on the identification and characterization of distinct CXCR-2 glycoforms and their subcellular distribution in neutrophils. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of surface-expressed receptors covalently linked to IL-8 or NAP-2 as well as in their unloaded state revealed the occurrence of a single CXCR-2 variant with an apparent size of 56 kDa. According to deglycosylation experiments surface-expressed CXCR-2 carries two N-linked 9-kDa carbohydrate moieties that are both of complex structure. In addition, two other CXCR-2 variants of 38 and 40 kDa were found to occur exclusively intracellular and to carry N-glycosylations of high mannose or hybrid type. These receptors did not participate in ligand-induced receptor trafficking, while surface-expressed CXCR-2 was internalized and re-expressed following stimulation with NAP-2. By enzymatic removal of one 9-kDa carbohydrate moiety in surface-expressed CXCR-2 we can show that neither NAP-2-induced trafficking nor signaling of the receptor is dependent on its full glycosylation. Instead, glycosylation was found to protect CXCR-2 from proteolytic attack, as even partial deglycosylation is associated with serine protease-mediated disappearance of the receptor from the neutrophil surface. Thus, although not directly involved in signaling, glycosylation appears to be required to maintain neutrophil responsiveness to CXC-chemokines during inflammation.
The H2-histamine receptor antagonists ranitidine and cimetidine were compared for their abilities to control gastric acid hypersecretion on a short- and long-term basis in 22 patients with gastric acid hypersecretory states. Nineteen patients had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, one patient had systemic mastocytosis, and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion. The rates of onset of the action of cimetidine and ranitidine were the same. The actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents, and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion. However, ranitidine was threefold more potent than cimetidine both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed (1.2 g per day for ranitidine and 3.6 g per day for cimetidine). Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or impotence while taking cimetidine and in all cases these changes disappeared when cimetidine was replaced by ranitidine. Treatment with high doses of cimetidine (one to 60 months; median, 11 months) or ranitidine (two to 31 months; median, 14 months) was not associated with hepatic or hematologic toxicity or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations, but ranitidine therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum creatinine level than seen with cimetidine therapy. The results show that both drugs can adequately inhibit acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states. Both are safe at high doses, but ranitidine is threefold more potent and does not cause the antiandrogen side effects frequently seen with high doses of cimetidine.
The HMGI family of proteins consists of three members, HMGIC, HMGI and HMGI (Y), that function as architectural factors and are essential components of the enhancesome. HMGIC is predominantly expressed in proliferating, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and is not detected in adult tissues. It is disrupted and misexpressed in a number of mesenchymal tumour cell types, including fat-cell tumours (lipomas). In addition Hmgic-/- mice have a deficiency in fat tissue. To study its role in adipogenesis and obesity, we examined Hmgic expression in the adipose tissue of adult, obese mice. Mice with a partial or complete deficiency of Hmgic resisted diet-induced obesity. Disruption of Hmgic caused a reduction in the obesity induced by leptin deficiency (Lepob/Lepob) in a gene-dose-dependent manner. Our studies implicate a role for HMGIC in fat-cell proliferation, indicating that it may be an adipose-specific target for the treatment of obesity..
The Huntington disease (HD) phenotype is associated with expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene, which is predicted to encode a 348-kDa protein named huntington. We used polyclonal and monoclonal anti-fusion protein antibodies to identify native huntingtin in rat, monkey, and human. Western blots revealed a protein with the expected molecular weight which is present in the soluble fraction of rat and monkey brain tissues and lymphoblastoid cells from control cases. In lymphoblastoid cell lines from juvenile-onset heterozygote HD cases, both normal and mutant huntingtin are expressed, and increasing repeat expansion leads to lower levels of the mutant protein. Immunocytochemistry indicates that huntingtin is located in neurons throughout the brain, with the highest levels evident in larger neurons. In the human striatum, huntingtin is enriched in a patch-like distribution, potentially corresponding to the first areas affected in HD. Subcellular localization of huntingtin is consistent with a cytosolic protein primarily found in somatodendritic regions. Huntingtin appears to particularly associate with microtubules, although some is also associated with synaptic vesicles. On the basis of the localization of huntingtin in association with microtubules, we speculate that the mutation impairs the cytoskeletal anchoring or transport of mitochondria, vesicles, or other organelles or molecules..
The IARC TP53 database: new online mutation analysis and recommendations to users.
The IFN-inducible nucleoprotein IFI 16 is expressed in cells of the monocyte lineage, but is rapidly and markedly down-regulated in other myeloid precursor populations.
The ING1 gene encodes p33(ING1), a putative tumor suppressor for neuroblastomas and breast cancers, which has been shown to cooperate with p53 in controlling cell proliferation. We have isolated a novel human gene, ING1L, that potentially encodes a PHD-type zinc-finger protein highly homologous to p33(ING1). Fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation-hybrid analyses assigned ING1L to human chromosome 4. Both ING1 and ING1L are expressed in a variety of human tissues, but we found ING1L expression to be significantly more pronounced in tumors from several colon-cancer patients than in normal colon tissues excised at the same surgical sites. Although the significance of this observation with respect to carcinogenesis remains to be established, the data suggest that ING1L might be involved in colon cancers through interference with signal(s) transmitted through p53 and p33(ING1).
The IRF5 polymorphism in type 1 diabetes.
The Jem-1 (JEM-1, HGMW-approved symbol BLZF1) gene mapping to human chromosome 1q24 codes for a ubiquitously expressed 3-kb mRNA, translated in a 45-kDa nuclear protein. Recent studies have shown a deficient expression of this gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, treatment with retinoids was able to upregulate JEM-1 mRNA in maturing NB4 leukemia cells. Here, we report the characterization of the structural organization of JEM-1. By hybridization screening of a human genomic library derived from blood mononuclear cells, five overlapping genomic DNA clones were isolated. These clones extend over 34 kb of the human genome and comprise the complete JEM-1 gene and a 4-kb 5'flanking region. Determination of the exon-intron structure of Jem-1 revealed seven exons whose junctions with introns exhibited typical splice sequences. A shorter transcript (Jem-1s, 1.3 kb) generated by exon 3 extension and polyadenylation was identified. Its translation generated a 23-kDa protein that exhibited a cytoplasmic localization. 5'RACE-PCR identified a major transcription start site (TSS) located at 403 nt upstream of the ATG. Computer analysis of the 1. 8-kb 5'flanking region showed that it lacks a TATA box, Inr motifs or DPE motifs, but it contains a typical CCAAT box located 95 bp upstream of the TSS. Sequencing also revealed potential cis-acting elements for multiple transcription regulators including Sp1, GATA, C/EBP, AP-1, and Pu1. No retinoic acid receptor elements or retinoic X receptor elements were detected. This 1.8-kb DNA sequence showed a strong constitutive promoter activity determined by a luciferase-reporter gene assay in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Retinoids further increased luciferase expression 2.7-fold. We demonstrated that the 1-kb distal sequence contains yet unidentified elements reducing constitutive transcription. Thus, the maximal constitutive promoter activity was assigned to a -432 + 101 region overlapping the TSS. These data support the idea of a constitutive expression of JEM-1, but a negative regulation in APL released by retinoids. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.
The KIT and FMS tyrosine kinase receptors, which are implicated in the control of cell growth and differentiation, stem through duplications from a common ancestor. We have conducted a detailed structural analysis of the two loci containing the KIT and FMS genes. The sequence of the approximately 90-kb KIT locus reveals the position and size of the 21 introns and of the 5' regulatory region of the KIT gene. The introns and the 3'-untranslated parts of KIT and FMS have been analyzed in parallel. Comparison of the two sequences shows that, while introns of both genes have extensively diverged in size and sequence, this divergence is, at least in part, due to intron expansion through internal duplications, as suggested by the discrete extant analogies. Repetitive elements as well as exon predictions obtained using the GRAIL and GENEFINDER programs are described in detail. These programs led us to identify a novel gene, designated SMF, immediately downstream of FMS, in the opposite orientation. This finding emphasizes the gene-rich characteristic of this genomic region.
The LEC rat has a deletion in the copper transporting ATPase gene homologous to the Wilson disease gene.
The LNCaP progression model of human prostate cancer consists of lineage-related sublines that differ in their androgen sensitivity and metastatic potential. A differential display polymerase chain reaction was employed to evaluate mRNA expression differences between the LNCaP sublines in order to define the differences in gene expression between the androgen-sensitive, nontumorigenic LNCaP cell line and the androgen-insensitive, metastatic LNCaP sublines, C4-2 and C4-2B. An amplicon, BG16.21, was isolated that showed increased expression in the androgen-independent and metastatic LNCaP sublines, C4-2 and C4-2B. Hybridization screening of a lambda gt11 expression library with BG16.21 revealed two transcripts, both homologous to BG16.21 at the 3' end. A GenBankTM data base search using the GCG Wisconsin software package revealed the shorter approximately 600-bp transcript (designated GAGE-7) to be a new member of the GAGE family. The second approximately 700-bp transcript was a novel gene (designated PAGE-1, "prostate associated gene") with only 45% homology to GAGE gene family members. RNA blot analysis demonstrated that GAGE-7 mRNA was expressed at equal levels in all lineage related prostate cancer cell sublines, while PAGE-1 mRNA levels were elevated 5-fold in C4-2 and C4-2B as compared with LNCaP cells. Neither GAGE-7 nor PAGE-1 demonstrated any regulation by androgens in the prostate cancer cell lines used in this study. PAGE-1 and GAGE-7 expression was found to be restricted to testes (high) and placenta (low) on human multiple tissue Northern blots. As GAGE/MAGE antigens were reported previously to be targets for tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes in melanoma, these results suggest that PAGE-1 and GAGE-7 may be related to prostate cancer progression and may serve as potential targets for novel therapies.
The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a severe X chromosome-linked human disease caused by a virtual absence of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity. A partial deficiency in the activity of this enzyme can result in gouty arthritis. To determine the genetic basis for reduction or loss of enzyme activity, we have amplified and sequenced the coding region of HPRT cDNA from four patients one with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (HPRTPerth) and three with partial deficiencies of HPRT activity, which have been designated HPRTUrangan, HPRTSwan and HPRTToowong. In all four patients, the only mutation identified was a single base substitution in exons 2 or 3 of the coding region, which in each case predicts a single amino acid substitution in the translated protein. Each base change was confirmed by allele-specific amplification of the patients genomic DNA. It is interesting to note that the mutation found for HPRTPerth is identical to that reported for HPRTFlint. It appears that the two mutations are de novo events..
The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat shows similarity to Wilson disease in many clinical and biochemical features. We have cloned cDNAs for the rat gene (Atp7b) homologous to the human Wilson disease gene (ATP7B) and have used them to identify a partial deletion in the Atp7b gene in the LEC rat. The deletion removes at least 900 bp of the coding region at the 3 end, includes the crucial ATP binding domain and extends downstream of the gene. Our results provide convincing evidence for defining the LEC rat as an animal model for Wilson disease. This model will be important for studying liver pathophysiology, for developing therapy for Wilson disease and for studying the pathway of copper transport and its possible interaction with other heavy metals..
The Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome (OCRL) is characterized by congenital cataract, mental retardation, and defective renal tubular function. A map assignment of OCRL to Xq24-q26 has been made previously by linkage analysis with DXS42 at Xq24-q26 (theta = 0, z = 5. 09) and with DXS10 at Xq26 (theta = 0, z = 6. 45). Two additional families were studied and three additional polymorphisms were identified at DXS42 by using a 35-kb sequence isolated with the probe detecting the original polymorphism at DXS42. With additional OCRL families made informative for DXS42, theta remained 0 with z = 6. 63; and for DXS10 theta = 0. 03 and z = 7. 07. Evidence for placing OCRL at Xq25 also comes from a female with Lowe syndrome and an X; 3 translocation. We have used the Xq25 breakpoint in this patient to determine the position of OCRL relative to the two linked markers. Each derivative chromosome was isolated away from its normal counterpart in somatic cell hybrids. DXS42 was mapped to the derivative chromosome X containing Xpterq25, and DXS10 was mapped to the derivative chromosome 3 containing Xq25-qter. The markers DXS10 and DXS42 therefore show tight linkage with OCRL in six families and flank the Xq25 breakpoint in a female patient with an X; 3 translocation. Linkage analysis with flanking markers was used to assess OCRL carrier status in women at risk. Results, when compared with carrier determination by ophthalmologic examination, indicated that the slit-lamp exam can be a sensitive and specific method of carrier determination in many cases
The MAD-related protein Smad7 associates with the TGFbeta receptor and functions as an antagonist of TGFbeta signaling.
The MDR1 multidrug transporter regulates the traffic of drugs, peptides and xenobiotics into the body as well as sensitive tissues like the brain, germ cells and the developing fetus. Hence, it may influence an individual's response to drugs as well as his/her susceptibility to complex diseases in which environmental factors, especially xenobiotics, play a role. Polymorphisms within this gene, especially single-nucleotide polymorphism e26/3435(C/T), have been variously associated with differences in MDR1 expression, function, drug response and disease susceptibility. Here, we report the detailed characterization of the haplotype and linkage disequilibrium architecture of the entire 200 kb of the MDR1 gene in five world populations, namely, Chinese, Malays, Indians, Caucasians and African-Americans. We observed varied haplotype diversity across the entire gene in the different populations. The major haplotype mh5, which contains the subhaplotype e12/1236T-e21/2677T-e26/3435T, is highly represented among the four non-African populations, while mh7, which contains the subhaplotype e12/1236C-e21/2677G-e26/3435C, accounts for over a third of African-American chromosomes. These observations are inconsistent with a simple population evolution model, but instead are suggestive of recent historical events that have maintained such long range linkage disequilibrium. Using a modified long-range haplotype test, we found statistically significant evidence of recent positive selection for the e21/2677T and e26/3435T alleles in the Chinese population, and for the e26/3435T allele in the Malay population. Interestingly, we also detected evidence for positive selection of the alternative allele e26/3435C in the African-American population. These data suggest that independent mutational events may have occurred on the mh5 and mh7 haplotypes of the MDR1 gene to confer positive selection in the non-African and African-American populations, respectively.
The Na +/glucose cotransporter gene SGLT1 encodes the primary carrier protein responsible for the uptake of the dietary sugars glucose and galactose from the intestinal lumen. SGLT1 transport activity is currently exploited in oral rehydration therapy. The 75-kDa glycoprotein is localized in the brush border of the intestinal epithelium and is predicted to comprise 12 membrane spans. In two patients with the autosomal recessive disease glucose/galactose malabsorption, the underlying cause was found to be a missense mutation in SGLT1, and the Asp28-- > Asn change was demonstrated in vitro to eliminate SGLT1 transport activity. The SGLT1 gene was previously shown to reside on the distal q arm of chromosome 22 (11. 2-- > qter). We have used a cosmid probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization, which refines the localization to 22q13. 1, and provide an example of the utility of the SGLT1 probe as a diagnostic for genetic diseases associated with translocations of chromosome 22.
The Norrie disease gene maps to a 150 kb region on chromosome Xp11.3.
The OGG1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a DNA glycosylase activity that is a functional analog of the Fpg protein from Escherichia coli and excises 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) from damaged DNA. The repair of this ubiquitous kind of oxidative damage is essential to prevent mutations both in bacteria and in yeast. A human cDNA clone carrying an ORF displaying homology to the yeast protein was identified. The predicted protein has 345 amino acids and a molecular mass of 39 kDa. This protein shares a 38% sequence identity with the yeast Ogg1 protein, adding this novel human gene product to the growing family of enzymes that the repair of oxidatively damaged bases and are related to the E. coli endonuclease III. Northern blot analysis indicates that this gene, localized to chromosome 3p25, is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. The cloned coding sequence was expressed in an E. coli strain that carried a disrupted fpg gene, the bacterial functional analog of OGG1. Cell-free extracts from these cultures displayed a specific lyase activity on duplex DNA that carried an 8-oxoG/C base pair. The products of the reaction are consistent with an enzymatic activity like the one displayed by the yeast Ogg1. Analysis of the substrate specificity reveals a very strong preference for DNA fragments harboring 8-oxoG/C base pairs. The pattern of specificity correlates well with the one found for the yeast enzyme. Moreover, when the human coding sequence was expressed in a yeast strain mutant in OGG1 it was able to complement the spontaneous mutator phenotype. These results make this novel gene (hOGG1) a strong candidate for the human homolog of the yeast OGG1 and suggest an important role of its product in the protection of the genome from the mutagenic effects of the oxidatively damaged purines.
The PAX6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis, and PAX6 mutations have been detected in various types of ocular anomalies, including aniridia, Peters anomaly, corneal dystrophy, congenital cataract, and foveal hypoplasia. The gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its paired-type DNA-binding domain. The paired domain is composed of two distinct DNA-binding subdomains, the N-terminal subdomain (NTS) and the C-terminal subdomain (CTS), which bind respective consensus DNA sequences. The human PAX6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain. The insertion, into the NTS, of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the DNA-binding activity of the NTS and unmasks the DNA-binding ability of the CTS. Thus, exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes. We ascertained a novel missense mutation in four pedigrees with Peters anomaly, congenital cataract, Axenfeldt anomaly, and/or foveal hypoplasia, which, to our knowledge, is the first mutation identified in the splice-variant region. A T-- > A transition at the 20th nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a Val-- > Asp (GTC-- > GAC) substitution at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region. Functional analyses demonstrated that the V54D mutation slightly increased NTS binding and decreased CTS transactivation activity to almost half..
The PDS gene encodes a transmembrane protein, known as pendrin, which functions as a transporter of iodide and chloride. Mutations in this gene are responsible for Pendred syndrome and autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss at the DFNB4 locus on chromosome 7q31. A screen of 20 individuals from the midwestern USA with non-syndromic hearing loss and dilated vestibular aqueducts identified three people (15%) with PDS mutations. To determine whether PDS mutations in individuals with Pendred syndrome differ functionally from PDS mutations in individuals with non-syndromic hearing loss, we compared three common Pendred syndrome allele variants (L236P, T416P and E384G), with three PDS mutations reported only in individuals with non-syndromic hearing loss (V480D, V653A and I490L/G497S). The mutations associated with Pendred syndrome have complete loss of pendrin-induced chloride and iodide transport, while alleles unique to people with DFNB4 are able to transport both iodide and chloride, albeit at a much lower level than wild-type pendrin. We hypothesize that this residual level of anion transport is sufficient to eliminate or postpone the onset of goiter in individuals with DFNB4. We propose a model for pendrin function in the thyroid in which pendrin transports iodide across the apical membrane of the thyrocyte into the colloid space..
The Pendred syndrome gene encodes a chloride-iodide transport protein.
The Polycomb-group (PcG) is a diverse set of proteins required for maintenance of gene silencing during development. In a screen for conserved partners of the PcG protein Polycomblike (Pcl), we have identified a new protein, human CHMP1 (CHromatin Modifying Protein; CHarged Multivesicular body Protein), which is encoded by an alternative open reading frame in the PRSM1 gene and is conserved in both complex and simple eukaryotes. CHMP1 contains a predicted bipartite nuclear localization signal and distributes as distinct forms to the cytoplasm and the nuclear matrix in all cell lines tested. We have constructed a stable HEK293 cell line that inducibly overexpresses CHMP1 under ecdysone control. Overexpressed CHMP1 localizes to a punctate subnuclear pattern, encapsulating regions of nuclease-resistant, condensed chromatin. These novel structures are also frequently surrounded by increased histone H3 phosphorylation and acetylation. CHMP1 can recruit a PcG protein, BMI1, to these regions of condensed chromatin and can cooperate with co-expressed vertebrate Pcl in a Xenopus embryo PcG assay; this is consistent with a role in PcG function. In combination, these observations suggest that CHMP1 plays a role in stable gene silencing within the nucleus.
The Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) critical region on 15q11-q13 is subject to imprinting. PWS becomes apparent when genes on the paternally inherited chromosome are not expressed. Familial PWS is rare. We report on a family in which a male and a female paternal first cousin both have PWS with cytogenetically normal karyotypes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis shows a submicroscopic deletion of SNRPN, but not the closely associated loci D15S10, D15S11, D15S63, and GABRB3. The cousins fathers and two paternal aunts have the same deletion and are clinically normal. The grandmother of the cousins is deceased and not available for study, and their grandfather is not deleted for SNRPN. DNA methylation analysis of D15S63 is consistent with an abnormality of the imprinting center associated with PWS. " Grandmatrilineal " inheritance occurs when a woman with deletion of an imprinted, paternally expressed gene is at risk of having affected grandchildren through her sons. In this case, PWS does not become evident as long as the deletion is passed through the matrilineal line. This represents a unique inheritance pattern due to imprinting..
The R496H mutation of arylsulfatase A does not cause metachromatic leukodystrophy.
The RB1 gene from 12 human retinoblastoma tumors has been analyzed exon-by-exon with the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. Mutations were found in all tumors, and one-third of the tumors had independent mutations in both alleles neither of which were found in the germ line, confirming their true sporadic nature. In the remaining two-thirds of the tumors only one mutation was found, consistent with the loss-of-heterozygosity theory of tumorigenesis. Point mutations, the majority of which were C-- > T transitions, were the most common abnormality and usually resulted in the conversion of an arginine codon to a stop codon. Small deletions were the second most common abnormality and most often created a downstream stop codon as the result of a reading frameshift. Deletions and point mutations also affected splice junctions. Direct repeats were present at the breakpoint junctions in the majority of deletions, supporting a slipped-mispairing mechanism. Point mutations generally produced DNA sequences which resulted in perfect homology with endogenous sequences which lay within 14 bp..
The RB1 gene mutation in a child with ectopic intracranial retinoblastoma.
The RB1 gene mutation was investigated in a child with ectopic intracranial retinoblastoma using DNA obtained from both the pineal and retinal tumours of the patient. A nonsense mutation in exon 17 (codon 556) of the RB1 gene was found to be present homozygously in both the retinal and the pineal tumours. The same mutation was present heterozygously in the DNA from the constitutional cells of the patient, proving it to be of germline origin. The initial mutation was shown to have occurred in the paternally derived RB1 allele. The mutation is in an area of the gene that encodes the protein-binding region known as the pocket region and has been detected in other cases of retinoblastoma..
The Rb1 gene has been implicated with retinoblastoma and is located on human Chromosome (Chr) 13q14. 2 2. A unique sequence human Rb1 cosmid DNA probe has been used to localize this region on apes Chr 14 by the FISH technique. The conservation of the Rb1 gene in higher primates at the corresponding equivalent chromosome locus (14q14) of the human may serve as a phylogenetic marker to further trace the evolutionary pathway of human descent.
The Rho family of GTPases control diverse biological processes, including cell morphology and mitogenesis. We have identified WASP, the protein that is defective in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), as a novel effector for CDC42Hs, but not for the other Rho family members, Rac and Rho. This interaction is dependent on the presence of the G protein-binding domain. Cellular expression of epitope-tagged WASP produces clusters of WASP that are highly enriched in polymerized actin. This clustering is not observed with a C-terminally deleted WASP and is inhibited by coexpression with dominant negative CDC42Hs-N17, but not with dominant negative forms of Rac or Rho. Thus, WASP provides a novel link between CDC42Hs and the actin cytoskeleton, which suggests a molecular mechanism for many of the cellular abnormalities in WAS. The WASP sequence contains two novel domains that are homologous to other proteins involved in action organization..
The Rho-family GTPase, Cdc42, can regulate the actin cytoskeleton through activation of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family members. Activation relieves an autoinhibitory contact between the GTPase-binding domain and the carboxy-terminal region of WASP proteins. Here we report the autoinhibited structure of the GTPase-binding domain of WASP, which can be induced by the C-terminal region or by organic co-solvents. In the autoinhibited complex, intramolecular interactions with the GTPase-binding domain occlude residues of the C terminus that regulate the Arp2/3 actin-nucleating complex. Binding of Cdc42 to the GTPase-binding domain causes a dramatic conformational change, resulting in disruption of the hydrophobic core and release of the C terminus, enabling its interaction with the actin regulatory machinery. These data show that intrinsically unstructured peptides such as the GTPase-binding domain of WASP can be induced into distinct structural and functional states depending on context..
The S100 proteins CAPL and CACY are expressed in a tissue- and cell-specific manner and have been reported to be associated with the metastatic phenotype of tumor cells. In order to study the biochemical, cation-binding, and conformational properties, we produced and purified large amounts of the recombinant human proteins in Escherichia coli. Several characteristics of native proteins are shown to correspond to those of the bacterially expressed proteins. Both are able to form homodimers in vitro, probably the biologically active species, but not heterodimers. The Ca(2+)-binding parameters were studied by flow offlysis at physiological ionic strength. Both isotherms show a maximum of two Ca2+ per protein and are insensitive to Mg2+, indicating that the sites are of the Ca(2+)-specific type. The isotherms show slight (CAPL, nH = 1.15) or pronounced (CACY, nH = 1.33) positive cooperativity with K0.5 values of 0.32 mM (CACY) and 0.15 mM (CAPL), indicating that the sites are of the low-affinity type. Conformational changes in the Tyr microenvironment of CACY indicate that Ca2+ binding induces a shift of Tyr to a less polar environment. Mg2+ does not affect the fluorescence properties nor does it induce a difference spectrum, thus suggesting that at physiological ionic conditions it does not interact with the protein. The Ca(2+)-induced difference spectra of CAPL are about 3 times smaller than those of CACY, suggesting that the additional Tyr84 in CACY is much more sensitive to Ca2+ than the two Tyr residues conserved in both proteins.
The SCA8 transcript is an antisense RNA to a brain-specific transcript encoding a novel actin-binding protein (KLHL1).
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MRE11 gene plays an important role in meiotic recombination, mitotic DNA repair and telomere maintenance. We present the isolation of hMRE11B cDNA from a human HeLa cell cDNA library as an MRE11 homolog. Compared to the previously identified hMRE11, hMRE11B contains an additional 84bp sequence that results in a 28 amino-acid insertion close to the C-terminus. The expression pattern of hMRE11B in different tissues shows the presence of two mRNA species of approx. 2.6 and 7.5kb. Overexpression of hMRE11B does not complement the alkylation sensitivity of the mre11 null and temperature-sensitive mutant strains. In this study, we examine factors that may explain this lack of complementation. First, both Northern and Western analyses rule out the lack of hMRE11B transcription and/or translation in yeast. Second, we demonstrate that hMre11B, like the yeast Mre11 protein, dimerizes in vivo in a yeast two-hybrid system. This dimerization requires the C-terminal one-third of hMre11B protein, which includes the 28 amino acids absent in hMre11. However, hMre11B does not interact with Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2. Hence, the lack of protein-protein interaction between hMre11B and the yeast Mre11, Rad50, and Xrs2 may explain the inability of hMRE11B to complement the yeast mre11 mutants. We rule out the hypothesis that the lack of interaction and, in turn of complementation, is due to the absence of sequence homology at the C-terminal domain of hMre11B compared to the yeast Mre11. Instead, we propose that the C-terminus of hMre11B participates in protein-protein interaction and functions in a species-specific manner.
The Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS; chondrodystrophic myotonia; McK 255, 800) is a recessively inherited condition defined by myotonia, short stature, and bone dysplasia. Genetic linkage between SJS and chromosomal region 1q36-34 has been observed in several families, but the gene has not yet been identified. We studied the clinical and radiological features in 81 patients from the literature and 5 own patients trying to identify distinct subgroups. In addition, we tested genetic linkage to the SJS locus on chromosome 1 in one family with two affected sibs. We found that a group of patients have mild skeletal changes which may be secondary consequences of myotonia, while another group of patients appear to have primary bone dysplasia with myotonia. Within this latter group, there are differences in age of manifestation, clinical course and pattern of bone changes. We tentatively isolate three different types of SJS type 1A, usually recognized in childhood, with moderate bone dysplasia, corresponding to the original descriptions of Schwartz, Jampel and Aberfeld; type 1B, similar to type 1A but recognizable at birth, with more pronounced bone dysplasia resembling Kniest dysplasia; and type 2, manifest at birth, with increased mortality and bone dysplasia resembling Pyle disease. Genetic analysis of the family with two sibs affected by SJS type 2 showed evidence against linkage to chromosome 1p36-34. CONCLUSIONS SJS is clinically and radiologically heterogeneous. The causes of heterogeneity are not known yet but are likely to include both different mutations at the SJS locus on chromosome 1 and the presence of a second SJS locus. A tentative clinico-radiological classification can be useful for the characterization of patients and the development of genotype-phenotype correlations..
The TGF-beta superfamily of proteins regulates many different biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation and embryonic pattern formation. TGF-beta-like factors signal across cell membranes through complexes of transmembrane receptors known as type I and type II serine/threonine-kinase receptors, which in turn activate the SMAD signalling pathway. On the inside of the cell membrane, a receptor-regulated class of SMADs are phosphorylated by the type-I-receptor kinase. In this way, receptors for different factors are able to pass on specific signals along the pathway: for example, receptors for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) target SMADs 1, 5 and 8, whereas receptors for activin and TGF-beta target SMADs 2 and 3. Phosphorylation of receptor-regulated SMADs induces their association with Smad4, the 'common-partner' SMAD, and stimulates accumulation of this complex in the nucleus, where it regulates transcriptional responses. Here we describe Smurf1, a new member of the Hect family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Smurf1 selectively interacts with receptor-regulated SMADs specific for the BMP pathway in order to trigger their ubiquitination and degradation, and hence their inactivation. In the amphibian Xenopus laevis, Smurf1 messenger RNA is localized to the animal pole of the egg; in Xenopus embryos, ectopic Smurf1 inhibits the transmission of BMP signals and thereby affects pattern formation. Smurf1 also enhances cellular responsiveness to the Smad2 (activin/TGF-beta) pathway. Thus, targeted ubiquitination of SMADs may serve to control both embryonic development and a wide variety of cellular responses to TGF-beta signals.

The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) family members play important roles in host defense. These receptors signal through TIR domain-containing adapter proteins. In this report, we identified a novel TIR domain-containing adapter protein designated as TIRP. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that TIRP is associated with IL-1 receptors. TIRP also interacts with kinase-inactive mutants of IRAK and IRAK-4, IRAK-2, IRAK-M, and TRAF6. Overexpression of TIRP activates NF-kappaB and potentiates IL-1 receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation. A dominant negative mutant of TIRP inhibits IL-1- but not tumor necrosis factor-triggered NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, TIRP-mediated NF-kappaB activation is inhibited by dominant negative mutants of IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, and IKKbeta. Our findings suggest that TIRP is involved in IL-1-triggered NF-kappaB activation and functions upstream of IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, and IKKbeta
The UBE3A gene encodes the E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase and has recently been shown to be mutated in Angelman syndrome patients who lack 15q11-q13 deletions or chromosome 15 paternal uniparental disomy. Previous UBE3A cDNA analysis has shown a coding region of approximately 2. 6 kb and a 3-untranslated region (UTR) of < 50 bp, whereas Northern analysis has indicated mRNA sizes of 5-8 kb. We have analyzed additional cDNA clones and provide evidence for an additional 0. 5 kb of 5-UTR and > 2 kb of 3-UTR. We have established the genomic organization of UBE3A and the sequence of intron-exon borders. We have also mapped two highly homologous processed pseudogenes, UBE3AP1 and UBE3AP2, to chromosomes 2 and 21, respectively, and determined their genomic organization. These results will form the basis for studies of mutation and imprinting of UBE3A.
The VacA toxin of Helicobacter pylori identifies a new intermediate filament-interacting protein.
The VacA toxin produced by Helicobacter pylori acts inside cells and induces the formation of vacuoles arising from late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Using VacA as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell library, we have identified a novel protein of 54 kDa (VIP54), which interacts specifically with VacA, as indicated by co-immunoprecipitation and binding experiments. VIP54 is expressed in cultured cells and many tissues, with higher expression in the brain, muscle, kidney and liver. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-VIP54 affinity- purified antibodies shows a fibrous pattern typical of intermediate filaments. Double label immunofluorescence performed on various cell lines with antibodies specific to different intermediate filament proteins revealed that VIP54 largely co-distributes with vimentin. In contrast to known intermediate filament proteins, VIP54 is predicted to contain approximately 50% of helical segments, but no extended coiled-coil regions. The possible involvement of this novel protein in interactions between intermediate filaments and late endosomal compartments is discussed.
The WASP gene has been recently cloned from Xp11. 23 and shown to be mutated in three patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). We have developed a screening protocol for identifying WASP gene alterations in genomic DNA and have identified a spectrum of novel mutations in 12 additional unrelated families. These missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations involve eight of the 12 exons of the gene. Two mutations creating premature termination codons were associated with lack of detectable mRNA on Northern blots. Four amino acid substitutions, Leu27Phe, Thr48Ile, Val75Met and Arg477Lys, were found in patients with congenital thrombocytopenia and no clinically evident immune defect indicating that the WASP gene is the site for mutations in X-linked thrombocytopenia as well as in WAS. A T-cell line from a WAS patient contained two independent DNA alterations, a constitutional frameshift mutation, also present in peripheral blood leukocytes from the patient, and compensatory splice site mutation unique to the cell line. The distribution of eight missense mutations provides valuable information on amino acids which are essential for normal protein function, and suggests that sites in the first two exons are hot-spots for mutation.
The WFDC1 gene encoding ps20 localizes to 16q24, a region of LOH in multiple cancers.
The Wilms tumor -suppressor gene, WT1, plays a key role in urogenital development, and WT1 dysfunction is implicated in both neoplastic (Wilms tumor, mesothelioma, leukemias, and breast cancer) and nonneoplastic (glomerulosclerosis) disease. The analysis of diseases linked specifically with WT1 mutations, such as Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), can provide valuable insight concerning the role of WT1 in development and disease. DDS is a rare childhood disease characterized by a nephropathy involving mesangial sclerosis, XY pseudohermaphroditism, and/or Wilms tumor (WT). DDS patients are constitutionally heterozygous for exonic point mutations in WT1, which include mutations predicted to truncate the protein within the C-terminal zinc finger (ZF) region. We report that heterozygosity for a targeted murine Wt1 allele, Wt1 (tmT396), which truncates ZF3 at codon 396, induces mesangial sclerosis characteristic of DDS in adult heterozygous and chimeric mice. Male genital defects also were evident and there was a single case of Wilms tumor in which the transcript of the nontargeted allele showed an exon 9 skipping event, implying a causal link between Wt1 dysfunction and Wilms tumorigenesis in mice. However, the mutant WT1 (tmT396) protein accounted for only 5% of WT1 in both heterozygous embryonic stem cells and the WT. This has implications regarding the mechanism by which the mutant allele exerts its effect.
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) has previously been mapped to the proximal short arm of the X chromosome between the DXS14 and DXS7 loci. In this study, further segregation analysis has been performed using a newly identified WAS family as well as an additional marker probe, HOATL1. The results indicate close linkage between the WAS and OATL1 loci (Z = 6. 08 at theta = 0. 00) and localize the TIMP, OATL1, DXS255, and WAS loci distal to DXS146 and the OATL1 and WAS loci proximal to TIMP. These linkage data narrow the boundaries within which the WAS locus maps to the chromosomal region bracketed by TIMP and DXS146 and support the loci order Xpter-DXS7-TIMP- (OATL1, WAS, DXS255) -DXS146.
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, small platelets, eczema, recurrent infections, and immunodeficiency. Besides the classic WAS phenotype, there is a group of patients with congenital X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) who have small platelets but only transient eczema, if any, and minimal immune deficiency. Because the gene responsible for WAS has been sequenced, it was possible to correlate the WAS phenotypes with WAS gene mutations. Using a fingerprinting screening technique, we determined the approximate location of the mutation in 13 unrelated WAS patients with mild to severe clinical symptoms. Direct sequence analysis of cDNA and genomic DNA obtained from patient-derived cell lines showed 12 unique mutations distributed throughout the WAS gene, including insertions, deletions, and point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions, termination, exon skipping, or splicing defects. Of 4 unrelated patients with the XLT phenotype, 3 had missense mutations affecting exon 2 and 1 had a splice-site mutation affecting exon 9. Patients with classic WAS had more complex mutations, resulting in termination codons, frameshift, and early termination. These findings provide direct evidence that XLT and WAS are caused by mutations of the same gene and suggest that severe clinical phenotypes are associated with complex mutations..
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is caused by defects in the WAS protein (WASP) gene on the X chromosome. Previous study disclosed that flow cytometric analysis of intracellular WASP expression (FCM-WASP analysis) in lymphocytes was useful for the diagnosis of WAS patients. Lymphocytes from all WAS patients showed WASPdim instead of WASPbright. Here we report that FCM-WASP analysis in monocytes could be a useful tool for the WAS carrier diagnosis. Monocytes from all nine WAS carriers showed varied population of WASPdim together with WASPbright. None of control individuals possessed the WASPdim population. In contrast, lymphocytes from all the carriers except two lacked the WASPdim population. The difference of the WASPdim population in monocytes and lymphocytes observed in WAS carriers suggests that WASP plays a more critical role in the development of lymphocytes than in that of monocytes. The present studies suggest that a skewed X-chromosomal inactivation pattern observed in WAS carrier peripheral blood cells is not fixed at the hemopoietic stem cell level but progresses after the lineage commitment..
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), an X-linked immunodeficiency disease caused by mutation in the recently isolated gene encoding WAS protein (WASP), is known to be associated with extensive clinical heterogeneity. Cumulative mutation data have revealed that WASP genotypes are also highly variable among WAS patients, but the relationship of phenotype with genotype in this disease remains unclear. To address this issue we characterized WASP mutations in 24 unrelated WAS patients, including 18 boys with severe classical WAS and 6 boys expressing mild forms of the disease, and then examined the degree of correlation of these as well as all previously published WASP mutations with disease severity. By analysis of these compiled mutation data, we demonstrated clustering of WASP mutations within the four most N-terminal exons of the gene and also identified several sites within this region as hotspots for WASP mutation. These characteristics were observed, however, in both severe and mild cases of the disease. Similarly, while the cumulative data revealed a predominance of missense mutations among the WASP gene lesions observed in boys with isolated thrombocytopenia, missense mutations were not exclusively associated with milder WAS phenotypes, but also comprised a substantial portion (38%) of the WASP gene defects found in patients with severe disease. These findings, as well as the detection of identical WASP mutations in patients with disparate phenotypes, reveal a lack of phenotype concordance with genotype in WAS and thus imply that phenotypic outcome in this disease cannot be reliably predicted solely on the basis of WASP genotypes..
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and X-linked congenital thrombocytopenia are caused by mutations of the same gene.
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) gene was found to be mutated in patients presenting with WAS and in patients showing X-linked thrombocytopenia. Mutation analysis in 19 families of German, Swiss and Turkish descent by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing resulted in the detection of seven novel and 10 known mutations. A striking clustering of missense mutations in the first four exons contrasted with a random distribution of nonsense mutations. More than 85% of all known missense mutations were localized in the amino-terminal stretch of the WASP gene product; this region contained a mutational hot spot at codon 86. No genotype-phenotype correlation emerged after a comparison of the identified mutations with the resulting clinical picture for a classical WAS phenotype. A substitution at codon 86 resulted in an extremely variable expression of the disease in a large Swiss family. An extended homology search revealed a distant relationship of this stretch to the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), which is involved in the maintenance of cyto-architecture by interacting with actin-like filaments..
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: refinement of the localization on Xp and identification of another closely linked marker locus, OATL1.
The Wnt gene family has a role in development as well as tumourigenesis. One mouse member, Wnt7a, is vital for limb development in vivo and also possesses transforming ability in vitro. This study reports the isolation of a full length of human homologue of mouse Wnt7a gene by library screening. Yeast artificial chromosome-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (YAC-FISH) mapped the WNT7A gene to chromosome 3p25. Human WNT7A had an ORF encoding a deduced protein of 349 aa that exhibited 97% and 92% identity to mouse Wnt7a at the aa and nucleic acid levels, respectively. It possessed the 22 conserved cysteine residues and 3 more at the amino terminus, and a putative poly A tail. This is the fifth human WNT gene in which a complete cDNA sequence had been determined.
The Zellweger spectrum of disease, encompassing Zellweger syndrome and the progressively milder phenotypes of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy and infantile Refsum disease, is due to a failure to form functional peroxisomes. Cell fusion complementation studies demonstrated that these diseases are genetically heterogeneous, with two-thirds of all patients lying within a single complementation group, CG1. Molecular genetic and cell biology studies have shown that PEX1 is deficient in many CG1 patients. However, previous studies have focused on mildly affected patients and there is still no report of two mutant PEX1 alleles in any Zellweger syndrome patient. Furthermore, mutations in the PMP70 gene have also been identified in two Zellweger syndrome patients from CG1, raising the possibility that CG1 patients may represent a mixture of PEX1-deficient and PMP70-deficient individuals. To address the molecular basis of disease in Zellweger syndrome patients from CG1, we examined all 24 PEX1 exons in four patients, including both patients that have mutations in PMP70. PEX1 mutations were detected in all four patients, including a 1-bp insertion (c. 2097insT) in exon 13 that was present in three of the four patients. Subsequent studies demonstrated that this mutation is present in one-half of all CG1 patients and correlates with the Zellweger syndrome phenotype. As this mutation leads to a loss of protein function its frequency makes it the most common cause of Zellweger syndrome, helping to explain the high percentage of patients that belong to CG1.
The ability of cardiomyocytes to synthesize DNA in response to experimentally induced cardiac hypertrophy was assessed in adult mice. Isoproterenol delivered by osmotic minipump implantation in adult C3Heb/FeJ mice resulted in a 46% increase in heart weight and a 19.3% increase in cardiomyocyte area. No DNA synthesis, as assessed by autoradiographic analysis of isolated cardiomyocytes, was observed in control or hypertrophic hearts. A survey of 15 independent inbred strains of mice revealed that ventricular cardiomyocyte nuclear number ranged from 3 to 13% mononucleate, suggesting that cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation is influenced directly or indirectly by genetic background. To determine whether the capacity for reactive DNA synthesis was also subject to genetic regulation, cardiac hypertrophy was induced in the strains of mice comprising the extremes of the nuclear number survey. These data indicate that adult mouse atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes do not synthesize DNA in response to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
The ability of insulin treatment to reverse or prevent the changes in urinary bladder function caused by streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus.
The ability to scan a large gene rapidly and accurately for all possible heterozygous mutations in large numbers of patient samples will be critical for the future of medicine. We have designed high-density arrays consisting of over 96, 600 oligonucleotides 20-nucleotides (nt) in length to screen for a wide range of heterozygous mutations in the 3. 45-kilobases (kb) exon 11 of the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene BRCA1. Reference and test samples were co-hybridized to these arrays and differences in hybridization patterns quantitated by two-colour analysis. Fourteen of fifteen patient samples with known mutations were accurately diagnosed, and no false positive mutations were identified in 20 control samples. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms were also readily detected. DNA chip-based assays may provide a valuable new technology for high-throughput cost-efficient detection of genetic alterations.
The abnormalities seen in Turner syndrome (monosomy X) presumably result from haploinsufficiency of certain genes on the X chromosome. Gene dosage considerations lead to the prediction that the culpable genes escape X inactivation and have functional homologs on the Y chromosome. Among the genes with these characteristics are those residing in the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) of the sex chromosomes. A pseudoautosomal location for a dosage-sensitive locus involved in stature has been suggested based on the analyses of patients with deletions of a specific segment of the short arm PAR; hemizygosity for this putative locus probably also contributes to the short stature in Turner individuals. We have isolated a gene from the critical deleted region that encodes a novel homeodomain-containing transcription factor and is expressed at highest levels in osteogenic cells. We have named the gene PHOG, for pseudoautosomal homeobox-containing osteogenic gene. Its deletion in patients with short stature, the predicted altered dosage in 45,X individuals, along with the nature of the encoded protein and its expression pattern, make PHOG an attractive candidate for involvement in the short stature of Turner syndrome. We have also found that the mouse homolog of PHOG is autosomal, which may help to explain the lack of a growth abnormality in mice with monosomy X.
The activation of spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial morphine after a noninjurious interval of spinal cord ischemia.
The activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene, specifically expressed in germinal center B cells in mice, is a member of the cytidine deaminase family. We herein report mutations in the human counterpart of AID in patients with the autosomal recessive form of hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM2). Three major abnormalities characterize AID deficiency: (1) the absence of immunoglobulin class switch recombination, (2) the lack of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutations, and (3) lymph node hyperplasia caused by the presence of giant germinal centers. The phenotype observed in HIGM2 patients (and in AID-/- mice) demonstrates the absolute requirement for AID in several crucial steps of B cell terminal differentiation necessary for efficient antibody responses.
The activities of the lysosomal enzymes acid and neutral protease, N-acetylglucosaminidase, and acid phosphatase were measured in the serum of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Acid protease (cathepsin D) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose, whereas activities were increased equally in patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to viral hepatitis whether or not they survived. A correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time, and the increase in cathepsin D activity was sustained over several days compared with aspartate aminotransferase, which showed a sharp early peak and then a fall. Circulating lysosomal proteases can damage other organs, and measurement of their activity may therefore be of added value in assessing prognosis in this condition.
The acute effect of insulin treatment on the earlier reported protective effect of streptozotocin diabetes against the cardiotoxic effect of high doses of isoproterenol (ISO) was investigated in rats. Thirty to 135 min after the injection of crystalline insulin, ISO was given subcutaneously and when ISO induced fibrosis in the myocardium was morphometrically analyzed 7 days later, a highly significant correlation (r = 0.83, 2 p = 0.006) to the slope of the fall in blood glucose after insulin treatment appeared. The myocardial content of catecholamines was estimated in these 8 day diabetic rats. The norepinephrine content was significantly increased while epinephrine remained unchanged. An enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity with a consequent down regulation of the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors could, therefore, explain this catecholamine resistance. The rapid reversion after insulin treatment excludes the possibility that streptozotocin in itself causes the ISO resistance and points towards a direct insulin effect on myocardial catecholamine sensitivity in diabetic rats. The phenomenon described might elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms behind toxic myocardial cell degeneration and may possibly have relevance for acute cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients.
The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour-suppressor protein controls the Wnt signalling pathway by forming a complex with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta), axin/conductin and betacatenin. Complex formation induces the rapid degradation of betacatenin. In colon carcinoma cells, loss of APC leads to the accumulation of betacatenin in the nucleus, where it binds to and activates the Tcf-4 transcription factor (reviewed in [1] [2]). Here, we report the identification and genomic structure of APC homologues. Mammalian APC2, which closely resembles APC in overall domain structure, was functionally analyzed and shown to contain two SAMP domains, both of which are required for binding to conductin. Like APC, APC2 regulates the formation of active betacatenin-Tcf complexes, as demonstrated using transient transcriptional activation assays in APC -/- colon carcinoma cells. Human APC2 maps to chromosome 19p13. 3. APC and APC2 may therefore have comparable functions in development and cancer.
The adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis and in sporadic colorectal tumors. Here the APC gene product is shown to bind through its armadillo repeat domain to a Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), termed Asef. Endogenous APC colocalized with Asef in mouse colon epithelial cells and neuronal cells. Furthermore, APC enhanced the GEF activity of Asef and stimulated Asef-mediated cell flattening, membrane ruffling, and lamellipodia formation in MDCK cells. These results suggest that the APC-Asef complex may regulate the actin cytoskeletal network, cell morphology and migration, and neuronal function..
The adipocyte specific transcription factor C/EBPalpha modulates human ob gene expression.
The administration of intermittent intravenous infusions of cimetidine is infrequently associated with the development of bradyarrhythmias. A 40-year-old man with leukemia and no history of cardiac disease developed recurrent, brief episodes of apparent sinus arrest while receiving continuous-infusion cimetidine 50 mg/hour. The arrhythmias were temporally related to cimetidine administration, disappeared after dechallenge, and did not recur during ranitidine treatment. This is the first reported case of sinus arrest associated with continuous-infusion cimetidine.
The aggravated risk on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with drugs used for stroke patients should be estimated carefully. We therefore established sensitive quantification methods and provided a rat ICH model for detection of ICH deterioration. In ICH intrastriatally induced by 0.014-unit, 0.070-unit, and 0.350-unit collagenase, the amount of bleeding was measured using a hemoglobin assay developed in the present study and was compared with the morphologically determined hematoma volume. The blood amounts and hematoma volumes were significantly correlated, and the hematoma induced by 0.014-unit collagenase was adequate to detect ICH deterioration. In ICH induction using 0.014-unit collagenase, heparin enhanced the hematoma volume 3.4-fold over that seen in control ICH animals and the bleeding 7.6-fold. Data suggest that this sensitive hemoglobin assay is useful for ICH detection, and that a model with a small ICH induced with a low-dose collagenase should be used for evaluation of drugs that may affect ICH.
The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone. Muscle tone was examined using a combined mechanoand electromyographic method, which measured simultaneously the muscle resistance (MMG) of the rat's hind foot to passive extension and flexion in the ankle joint and the electromyographic activity (EMG) of the antagonistic muscles of that joint: gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. Muscle rigidity was induced by haloperidol (2.5 mg/kg i.p.). 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (5,7-DCKA), a selective glycine site antagonist, injected in doses of 2.5 and 4.5 microg/0.5 microl bilaterally, into the rostral region of the striatum, decreased both the haloperidol-induced muscle rigidity (MMG) and the enhanced electromyographic activity (EMG). 5,7-DCKA injected bilaterally in a dose of 4.5 microg/0.5 microl into the intermediate-caudal region of the striatum of rats not pretreated with haloperidol had no effect on the muscle tone. The present results suggest that blockade of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in the rostral part of the striatum may be mainly responsible for the antiparkinsonian action of this drug.
The aim of the present study was to find out whether the metabotropic receptor 1 (mGluR1) and group II mGluRs, localized in the striatum, are involved in antiparkinsonian-like effects in rats. Haloperidol (1 mg/kg ip) induced parkinsonian-like muscle rigidity, measured as an increased resistance of a rat's hind foot to passive flexion and extension at the ankle joint. (RS)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA; 0.5-15 microg/0.5 microl), a potent and selective mGluR1 antagonist, or (2R,4R)-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (2R,4R-APDC; 7.5-15 microg/0.5 microl), a selective group II agonist, was injected bilaterally into the striatum of haloperidol-treated animals. AIDA in doses of 7.5-15 microg/0.5 microl diminished the haloperidol-induced muscle rigidity. In contrast, 2R,4R-APDC injections were ineffective. The present results may suggest that the blockade of striatal mGluR1, but not the stimulation of group II mGluRs, may ameliorate parkinsonian muscle rigidity.
The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) concentration and platelet serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine, 5-HT) content during the immediate headache and the delayed genuine migraine attack provoked by nitroglycerin. Fifteen female migraineurs (without aura) and eight controls participated in the study. Sublingual nitroglycerin (0.5 mg) was administered. Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times: 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application, and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack (mean 344 and 404 min; 12 subjects). In those subjects who had no migraine attack (11 subjects) a similar time schedule was used. Plasma CGRP concentration increased significantly (P<0.01) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine. In addition, both change and peak, showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity (P<0.001). However, plasma CGRP concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack. Basal CGRP concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5-HT content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack. Platelet serotonin content decreased significantly (P<0.01) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine attack. In conclusion, the fact that plasma CGRP concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between CGRP and migraine. In contrast, serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine, it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant CGRP release in this model.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role for a selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist in the treatment of urinary stress incontinence. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study design was employed. Half log incremental doses of intravenous methoxamine or placebo (saline) were administered to a group of women with genuine stress incontinence while measuring maximum urethral pressure (MUP), blood pressure, heart rate, and symptomatic side effects. Methoxamine evoked non-significant increases in MUP and diastolic blood pressure but caused a significant rise in systolic blood pressure and significant fall in heart rate at maximum dosage. Systemic side effects including piloerection, headache, and cold extremities were experienced in all subjects. The results indicate that the clinical usefulness of direct, peripherally acting sub-type-selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonists in the medical treatment of stress incontinence may be limited by associated piloerection and cardiovascular side effects.
The aim of the study was to examine the influence of hyperprolactinemia, induced by haloperidol (HAL) on age related morphology and function changes of epithelial cells in rat prostate lateral lobe. The study was performed on sexually mature male rats. Serum concentrations of prolactin (PRL) and testosterone (T) were measured. Tissue sections were evaluated with light and electron microscopy. Immunohistochemical reactions for Anti-Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) were performed. In rats of the experimental group, the mean concentration of: PRL was more than twice higher, whereas T concentration was almost twice lower than that in the control group. Light microscopy visualized the following: hypertrophy and epithelium hyperplasia of the glandular ducts, associated with increased PCNA expression. Electron microscopy revealed changes in columnar epithelial cells, concerning organelles, engaged in protein synthesis and secretion.
The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Ro15-1788 and a placebo in reversing diazepam-induced effects after surgery under epidural block, and to evaluate the local tolerance and general safety of Ro15-1788. Fifty-seven patients were sedated with diazepam for surgery under epidural anaesthesia. Antagonism of diazepam-induced effects by Ro15-1788 was investigated postoperatively in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The patient's subjective assessment of mood rating, an objective test of performance, a test for amnesia, and vital signs were recorded for up to 300 min after administration of the trial drug. No significant differences between the two groups were observed for mood rating, amnesia, or vital signs. The Ro15-1788 group showed a significant improvement in the performance test up to 120 min after administration of the drug. There was no evidence of reaction at the injection site.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between phenytoin medication and cerebellar atrophy in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication. Five females and 6 males, 21-59 years of age, were examined with a 1.5-T whole-body system using a circular polarized head coil. Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation. In addition, we performed a high-resolution 3D gradient echo, T1-weighted sequences at a 1-mm slice thickness. The images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum. Cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67.66 and 131.08 ml (mean 108.9 ml). In addition 3D gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female age-matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes. Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between seizure duration, elevation of phenytoin serum levels and cerebellar volume. However, multiple regression for the daily dosage, duration of phenytoin treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters. We conclude that phenytoin overdosage does not necessarily result in cerebellar atrophy and it is unlikely that phenytoin medication was the only cause of cerebellar atrophy in the remaining patients. Quantitative morphometric studies of the cerebellum provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of cerebellar disorders.
The aim of this study was to examine the impact of anemia prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in solid experimental tumors. Anemia was induced using a single dose of carboplatin (50 mg/kg i.v.) resulting in a long-lasting reduction (30%) of the hemoglobin concentration. In a second group, the development of anemia was prevented by rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) administered s.c. three times/week starting 7 days before carboplatin application. Four days after carboplatin treatment, tumors (DS-sarcoma of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum. Neither carboplatin nor rHuEPO treatment influenced tumor growth rate per se. When tumors were treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days after implantation, a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was observed. In the anemia group, the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls (13.3 days versus 8.6 days). In the group where anemia was prevented by rHuEPO treatment, growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls (13.3 days). These results suggest that chemotherapy-induced anemia reduces cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in tumors, whereas correction of anemia by rHuEPO treatment (epoetin alpha) increases the sensitivity, probably as a result of an improved oxygen supply to tumor tissue.
The aim of this study was to examine the role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in the toxic action of methamphetamine on dopaminergic neurones in rats. Methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc), administered five times, reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in striatal tissue when measured 72 h after the last injection. A selective antagonist of mGluR5, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP; 5 mg/kg ip), when administered five times immediately before each methamphetamine injection reversed the above-mentioned methamphetamine effects. A single MPEP (5 mg/kg ip) injection reduced the basal extracellular dopamine level in the striatum, as well as dopamine release stimulated either by methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc) or by intrastriatally administered veratridine (100 microM). Moreover, it transiently diminished the methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc)-induced hyperthermia and reduced basal body temperature. MPEP administered into the striatum at high concentrations (500 microM) increased extracellular dopamine levels, while lower concentrations (50-100 microM) were devoid of any effect. The results of this study suggest that the blockade of mGluR5 by MPEP may protect dopaminergic neurones against methamphetamine-induced toxicity. Neuroprotection rendered by MPEP may be associated with the reduction of the methamphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in the striatum due to the blockade of extrastriatal mGluR5, and with a decrease in hyperthermia.
The aim of this work was to search for unequal birth prevalence rates (BPRs) of cleft lip +/- cleft palate (CL/P), and cleft palate only (CPO), among different geographic areas in South America, and to analyze phenotypic characteristics and associated risk factors in each identified cluster. Included were 5,128 CL/P cases, 1,745 CPO cases, and 3,712 controls (like-sexed, non-malformed liveborn infant, born immediately after a malformed one, in the same hospital), over 4,199,630 consecutive births. They were ascertained between 1967 and 2004, in 190 maternity hospitals of the ECLAMC (Estudio Colaborativo Latinoamericano de Malformaciones Congenitas) network, in 102 cities of all 10 South American countries. Non-predefined geographical areas with significantly unusual cleft BPRs were identified with Kulldorf and Nagarwalla's spatial scan statistic, employing number of cases and births, and exact location of each hospital. Expected values were cleft BPRs registered for the entire ECLAMC hospital network. Syndromic and non-syndromic clefts were considered for cluster analysis, and phenotypic characterization, while only non-syndromic for risk factor analysis. Seven clusters for CL/P, and four for CPO, with unusual BPRs were identified. CL/P cases in high BPR areas were more severe than elsewhere in the sample, similar to a previous ECLAMC report on microtia. For CL/P, high BPR clusters were associated with high altitude above sea level, Amerindian ancestry, and low socioeconomic strata; low BPR clusters showed association with African Black ancestry. Advanced maternal age, a recognized risk factor for CPO, was also associated with the only identified geographic cluster for CPO.
The aims of this study were to examine vancomycin (VCM)-induced oxidative stress that promotes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to investigate the role of erdosteine, an expectorant agent, which has also antioxidant properties, on kidney tissue against the possible VCM-induced renal impairment in rats. Rats were divided into three groups: sham, VCM and VCM plus erdosteine. VCM was administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 200mgkg(-1) twice daily for 7 days. Erdosteine was administered orally. VCM administration to control rats significantly increased renal malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG, a marker of renal tubular injury) excretion but decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. Erdosteine administration with VCM injections caused significantly decreased renal MDA and urinary NAG excretion, and increased SOD activity, but not CAT activity in renal tissue when compared with VCM alone. Erdosteine showed histopathological protection against VCM-induced nephrotoxicity. There were a significant dilatation of tubular lumens, extensive epithelial cell vacuolization, atrophy, desquamation, and necrosis in VCM-treated rats more than those of the control and the erdosteine groups. Erdosteine caused a marked reduction in the extent of tubular damage. It is concluded that oxidative tubular damage plays an important role in the VCM-induced nephrotoxicity and the modulation of oxidative stress with erdosteine reduces the VCM-induced kidney damage both at the biochemical and histological levels.
The alpha 1-protease inhibitor, or alpha-antitrypsin (AAT), a major plasma inhibitor of leukocyte elastase and bacterial proteases, is encoded at the PI locus on chromosome 14 (14q24. 3-q32. 1). A deficiency of AAT in individuals homozygous for the PI Z allele occurs in about 1 in 2, 000-8, 000 caucasians and is associated with an increased risk of early adult onset emphysema and liver disease in childhood. We have now used DNA polymorphisms associated with the AAT gene to investigate the origin of the PI Z allele. Using two genomic probes extending into the 5 and 3 flanking regions, respectively, we have identified eight polymorphic restriction sites. Extensive linkage disequilibrium occurs throughout the probed region with the PI Z allele, but not with normal PI M alleles. The Z allele occurs mainly with one haplotype, indicating a single, relatively recent, origin in caucasians
The alpha3 and beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits are necessary for nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion in mice.
The alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma PAX3/FKHR fusion protein is a transcriptional activator.
The anaemia induced by 3'-azido-3'dideoxythymidine (AZT) is poorly understood. We have used a murine model of AIDS, infection of female C57BL/6 mice with LP-BM5 murine leukaemia (MuLV) virus, to determine if AZT-induced anaemia is due, in part, to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors (BFU-e) to erythropoietin (EPO). Mice in the early stage of LP-BM5 MuLV disease were given AZT in their drinking water at 1.0 and 2.5 mg/ml. AZT produced anaemia in both groups, in a dose-dependent fashion. Despite the anaemia, the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU-e in AZT treated mice increased up to five-fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treatment. Colony formation by splenic and bone marrow BFUe was stimulated at lower concentrations of EPO in mice receiving AZT for 15 d than for infected, untreated mice. By day 30, sensitivity of both splenic and bone marrow BFU-e of treated animals returned to that observed from cells of infected untreated animals. The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in AZT treated mice were appropriate for the degree of anaemia observed when compared with phenylhydrazine (PHZ) treated mice. The numbers of BFU-e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in AZT and PHZ treated mice with similar degrees of anaemia. However, reticulocytosis was inappropriate for the degree of anaemia observed in AZT treated infected mice. AZT-induced peripheral anaemia in the face of increased numbers of BFU-e and increased levels of plasma EPO suggest a lesion in terminal differentiation.
The anatomical and aetiological diagnoses of peripheral nerve disease excluding its primary benign and malignant disorders, as seen in 358 Nigerians are presented. There is a male preponderance and the peak incidence is in the fourth decade. Sensori-motor neuropathy was the commonest presentation (50%). Guillain-Barr syndrome was the commonest identifiable cause (15.6%), accounting for half of the cases with motor neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy due to nutritional deficiency of thiamine and riboflavin was common (10.1%) and presented mainly as sensory and sensori-motor neuropathy. Diabetes mellitus was the major cause of autonomic neuropathy. Isoniazid was the most frequent agent in drug-induced neuropathy. Migraine (20%) was not an uncommon cause of cranial neuropathy although malignancies arising from the reticuloendothelial system or related structures of the head and neck were more frequent (26%). In 26.5% of all the cases, the aetiology of the neuropathy was undetermined. Heredofamilial and connective tissue disorders were rare. Some of the factors related to the clinical presentation and pathogenesis of the neuropathies are briefly discussed.
The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily that plays an important role in male sexual differentiation and prostate cell proliferation. Mutations or abnormal expression of AR in prostate cancer can play a key role in the process that changes prostate cancer from androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent stage. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we were able to isolate a ligand-dependent AR-associated protein (ARA70), which functions as an activator to enhance AR transcriptional activity 10-fold in the presence of 10(-10) M dihydrotestosterone or 10(-9) M testosterone, but not 10(-6) M hydroxyflutamide in human prostate cancer DU145 cells. Our data further indicated that ARA70 Will only slightly induce the transcriptional activity of other steroid receptors such as estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and progesterone receptor in DU145 cells. Together, these data suggest that AR may need a specific coactivator(s) such as ARA70 for optimal androgen activity.
The annual incidence of warfarin-related bleeding at Brigham and Women's Hospital increased from 0.97/1,000 patient admissions in the first time period (January 1995 to October 1998) to 1.19/1,000 patient admissions in the second time period (November 1998 to August 2002) of this study. The proportion of patients with major and intracranial bleeding increased from 20.2% and 1.9%, respectively, in the first time period, to 33.3% and 7.8%, respectively, in the second.
The anti-dementia effects of s-limonene and s-perillyl alcohol were observed using the passive avoidance test (PA) and the open field habituation test (OFH). These lemon essential oils showed strong ability to improve memory impaired by scopolamine; however, s-perillyl alcohol relieved the deficit of associative memory in PA only, and did not improve non-associative memory significantly in OFH. Analysis of neurotransmitter concentration in some brain regions on the test day showed that dopamine concentration of the vehicle/scopolamine group was significantly lower than that of the vehicle/vehicle group, but this phenomenon was reversed when s-limonene or s-perillyl alcohol were administered before the injection of scopolamine. Simultaneously, we found that these two lemon essential oil components could inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in vitro using the Ellman method.
The antiangiogenic effects of thalidomide have been assessed in clinical trials in patients with various solid and haematological malignancies. Thalidomide blocks the activity of angiogenic agents including bFGF, VEGF and IL-6. We undertook an open-label study using thalidomide 100 mg once daily for up to 6 months in 20 men with androgen-independent prostate cancer. The mean time of study was 109 days (median 107, range 4-184 days). Patients underwent regular measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), urea and electrolytes, serum bFGF and VEGF. Three men (15%) showed a decline in serum PSA of at least 50%, sustained throughout treatment. Of 16 men treated for at least 2 months, six (37.5%) showed a fall in absolute PSA by a median of 48%. Increasing levels of serum bFGF and VEGF were associated with progressive disease; five of six men who demonstrated a fall in PSA also showed a decline in bFGF and VEGF levels, and three of four men with a rising PSA showed an increase in both growth factors. Adverse effects included constipation, morning drowsiness, dizziness and rash, and resulted in withdrawal from the study by three men. Evidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy was found in nine of 13 men before treatment. In the seven men who completed six months on thalidomide, subclinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy was found in four before treatment, but in all seven at repeat testing. The findings indicate that thalidomide may be an option for patients who have failed other forms of therapy, provided close follow-up is maintained for development of peripheral neuropathy.
The antiarrhythmic activity of the compound N-(trans-3-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl)-N-(3-oxo-3-phenyl-2-methylpropyl)-piperazine hydrochloride, referred to as P11, is studied on anaesthesized cats and Wistar albino rats, as well as on non-anaesthesized rabbits. Four types of experimental arrhythmia are used--with BaCl2, with chloroform-adrenaline, with strophantine G and with aconitine. The compound P11 is introduced in doses of 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg intravenously and 10 mg/kg orally. The compound manifests antiarrhythmic activity in all models of experimental arrhythmia used, causing greatest inhibition on the arrhythmia induced by chloroform-adrenaline (in 90 per cent) and with BaCl2 (in 84 per cent). The results obtained are associated with the beta-adrenoblocking and with the membrane-stabilizing action of the compound.
The antiarrhythmic effect and possible ionic mechanisms of pilocarpine on animal models.
The antiarrhythmic effects of the sustained release form of mexiletine (Mexitil-Perlongets) were evaluated in a double-blind placebo trial in 630 patients with recent documented myocardial infarction. The primary response variable was based on central reading of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings and was defined as the occurrence of 30 or more single premature ventricular complexes in any two consecutive 30 minute blocks or one or more runs of two or more premature ventricular complexes in the entire 24 hour electrocardiographic recording. Large differences, regarded as statistically significant, between the mexiletine and placebo groups were noted in that end point at months 1 and 4, but only trends were observed at month 12. These differences were observed even though the serum mexiletine levels obtained in this study were generally lower than those observed in studies that have used the regular form of the drug. There were more deaths in the mexiletine group (7.6%) than in the placebo group (4.8%); the difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of coronary events was similar in both groups. Previously recognized side effects, particularly tremor and gastrointestinal problems, were more frequent in the mexiletine group than in the placebo group.
The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients. Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxicity. Mitochondrial analysis, respiration intensity, levels of reactive oxygen species, permeability transition, and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after gentamicin administration. Metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin-mediated acute renal failure. This was accompanied by a lower activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems. Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration. These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function. We found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components (cytochrome c, NADH), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores. These injuries, partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain, were significantly decreased by metformin. Thus, our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis.
The antiepileptic drugs, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine are well known to cause cognitive impairment on chronic use. The increase in free radical generation has been implicated as one of the important mechanisms of cognitive impairment by antiepileptic drugs. Curcumin has shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective properties. Therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic curcumin administration on phenobarbitone- and carbamazepine-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats. Pharmacokinetic interactions of curcumin with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine were also studied. Vehicle/drugs were administered daily for 21days to male Wistar rats. Passive avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze test were used to assess cognitive function. At the end of study period, serum phenobarbitone and carbamazepine, whole brain malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels were estimated. The administration of phenobarbitone and carbamazepine for 21days caused a significant impairment of learning and memory as well as an increased oxidative stress. Concomitant curcumin administration prevented the cognitive impairment and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic drugs. Curcumin co-administration did not cause any significant alteration in the serum concentrations of both phenobarbitone as well as carbamazepine. These results show that curcumin has beneficial effect in mitigating the deterioration of cognitive functions and oxidative damage in rats treated with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine without significantly altering their serum concentrations. The findings suggest that curcumin can be considered as a potential safe and effective adjuvant to phenobarbitone and carbamazepine therapy in preventing cognitive impairment associated with these drugs.
The antinociceptive effect of 3 alpha-tropyl 2-(p-bromophenyl)propionate [(+/-)-PG-9] (10-40 mg kg-1 s.c.; 30-60 mg kg-1 p.o.; 10-30 mg kg-1 i.v.; 10-30 micrograms/mouse i.c.v.) was examined in mice, rats and guinea pigs by use of the hot-plate, abdominal-constriction, tail-flick and paw-pressure tests. (+/-)-PG-9 antinociception peaked 15 min after injection and then slowly diminished. The antinociception produced by (+/-)-PG-9 was prevented by the unselective muscarinic antagonist atropine, the M1-selective antagonists pirenzepine and dicyclomine and the acetylcholine depletor hemicholinium-3, but not by the opioid antagonist naloxone, the gamma-aminobutyric acidB antagonist 3-aminopropyl-diethoxy-methyl-phosphinic acid, the H3 agonist R-(alpha)-methylhistamine, the D2 antagonist quinpirole, the 5-hydroxytryptamine4 antagonist 2-methoxy-4-amino-5-chlorobenzoic acid 2-(diethylamino)ethyl ester hydrochloride, the 5-hydroxytryptamin1A antagonist 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine hydrobromide and the polyamines depletor reserpine. Based on these data, it can be postulated that (+/-)-PG-9 exerted an antinociceptive effect mediated by a central potentiation of cholinergic transmission. (+/-)-PG-9 (10-40 mg kg-1 i.p.) was able to prevent amnesia induced by scopolamine (1 mg kg-1 i.p.) and dicyclomine (2 mg kg-1 i.p.) in the mouse passive-avoidance test. Affinity profiles of (+/-)-PG-9 for muscarinic receptor subtypes, determined by functional studies (rabbit vas deferens for M1, guinea pig atrium for M2, guinea pig ileum for M3 and immature guinea pig uterus for putative M4), have shown an M4/M1 selectivity ratio of 10.2 that might be responsible for the antinociception and the anti-amnesic effect induced by (+/-)-PG-9 through an increase in acetylcholine extracellular levels. In the antinociceptive and antiamnesic dose range, (+/-)-PG-9 did not impair mouse performance evaluated by the rota-rod test and Animex apparatus.
The antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) has previously been suggested to confer protection against coronary heart disease (CHD), one of the main causes of death in the Western world. Two coding polymorphisms, 55M/L and 192Q/R, and a promoter variant, -107C/T, has been extensively studied with respect to susceptibility to CHD. In this study, we have investigated the impact of these three polymorphisms on mortality using a sample of 1932 Danish individuals aged 47-93 years, previously used in gene-longevity studies. A cross-sectional study comparing the genotype distribution of the three polymorphisms separately as well as the haplotype distribution in different age groups did not reveal any difference. However, a longitudinal follow-up study on survival in the same sample indicated that 192RR homozygotes have a poorer survival compared to QQ homozygotes (hazard rate: 1.38, P = 0.04). We hereafter used an independent sample of 541 Danish individuals from the oldest cohort and confirmed the initial findings (hazard rate: 1.38, P = 0.09). In both samples, the effect was most pronounced in women. Using self-reported data on ischemic heart disease to evaluate the impact of the PON 192Q/R polymorphism on susceptibility to CHD, we found only a nonsignificant trend of 192RR homozygosity in women being a risk factor. Our results thus indicates that PON1 192RR homozygosity is associated with increased mortality in women in the second half of life and that this increased mortality is possibly related to CHD severity and survival after CHD rather than susceptibility to development of CHD.
The antipsychotic agent, remoxipride [(S)-(-)-3-bromo-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-2,6-dimethoxybenz amide] has been associated with acquired aplastic anemia. We have examined the ability of remoxipride, three pyrrolidine ring metabolites and five aromatic ring metabolites of the parent compound to induce apoptosis in HL60 cells and human bone marrow progenitor (HBMP) cells. Cells were treated for 0-24 h with each compound (0-200 microM). Apoptosis was assessed by fluorescence microscopy in Hoechst 33342- and propidium iodide stained cell samples. Results were confirmed by determination of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation using gel electrophoresis for HL60 cell samples and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay in HBMP cells. The catechol and hydroquinone metabolites, NCQ436 and NCQ344, induced apoptosis in HL60 and HBMP cells in a time- and concentration dependent manner, while the phenols, NCR181, FLA873, and FLA797, and the derivatives formed by oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring, FLA838, NCM001, and NCL118, had no effect. No necrosis was observed in cells treated with NCQ436 but NCQ344 had a biphasic effect in both cell types, inducing apoptosis at lower concentrations and necrosis at higher concentrations. These data show that the catechol and hydroquinone metabolites of remoxipride have direct toxic effects in HL60 and HBMP cells, leading to apoptosis, while the phenol metabolites were inactive. Similarly, benzene-derived catechol and hydroquinone, but not phenol, induce apoptosis in HBMP cells [Moran et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 50 (1996) 610-615]. We propose that remoxipride and benzene may induce aplastic anemia via production of similar reactive metabolites and that the ability of NCQ436 and NCQ344 to induce apoptosis in HBMP cells may contribute to the mechanism underlying acquired aplastic anemia that has been associated with remoxipride.
The apical ballooning syndrome (ABS) is a recently described stress-mediated acute cardiac syndrome characterized by transient wall-motion abnormalities involving the apex and midventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular (LV) segments without obstructive epicardial coronary disease. Cardiotoxicity is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents. However, there are no reports of ABS secondary to chemotherapeutic agents. We describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic cancer. A 79-year-old woman presented with typical ischemic chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes with significant ST-segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram. She underwent recent chemotherapy with fluorouracil for metastatic colorectal cancer. Echocardiography revealed a wall-motion abnormality involving the apical and periapical segments which appeared akinetic. Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary lesions. The patient was stabilized with medical therapy. Four weeks later she remained completely asymptomatic. Echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and a resolution of the apical akinesis. Pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiac complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy include coronary vasospasm, endothelial damage and consequent thrombus formation. In our patient, both supraphysiologic levels of plasma catecholamines and stress related neuropeptides caused by cancer diagnosis as well as chemotherapy may have contributed the development of ABS.
The appearance of nephrotic syndromes such as proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia and increase in blood nitrogen urea, induced in rats by injection of puromycin aminonucleoside was markedly inhibited by oral administration of Dup 753 (losartan), a novel angiotensin II receptor antagonist, at a dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg per day. The results suggest a possible involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis.
The aquaporins transport water through membranes of numerous tissues, but the molecular mechanisms for sensing changes in extracellular osmolality and regulating water balance in brain are unknown. We have isolated a brain aquaporin by homology cloning. Like aquaporin 1 (AQP1, also known as CHIP, channel-forming integral membrane protein of 28 kDa), the deduced polypeptide has six putative transmembrane domains but lacks cysteines at the known mercury-sensitive sites. Two initiation sites were identified encoding polypeptides of 301 and 323 amino acids; expression of each in Xenopus oocytes conferred a 20-fold increase in osmotic water permeability not blocked by 1 mM HgCl2, even after substitution of cysteine at the predicted mercury-sensitive site. Northern analysis and RNase protection demonstrated the mRNA to be abundant in mature rat brain but only weakly detectable in eye, kidney, intestine, and lung. In situ hybridization of brain localized the mRNA to ependymal cells lining the aqueduct, glial cells forming the edge of the cerebral cortex and brainstem, vasopressin-secretory neurons in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of hypothalamus, and Purkinje cells of cerebellum. Its distinctive expression pattern implicates this fourth mammalian member of the aquaporin water channel family (designated gene symbol, AQP4) as the osmoreceptor which regulates body water balance and mediates water flow within the central nervous system.
The association between normal alleles at the CTG repeat and two nearby polymorphisms in the myotonin protein kinase gene, the Alu insertion/deletion polymorphism and the myotonic dystrophy kinase (DMK) (G/T) intron 9/HinfI polymorphism, has been analyzed in South African Negroids, a population in which myotonic dystrophy (DM) has not been described. South African Negroids have a CTG allelic distribution that is significantly different from that in Caucasoids and Japanese the CTG repeat lengths of > or = 19 are very rare. The striking linkage disequilibrium between specific alleles at the Alu polymorphism (Alu (ins) and Alu (del)), the HinfI polymorphism (HinfI-1 and HinfI-2), and the CTG repeat polymorphism seen in Caucasoid (Europeans and Canadians) populations was also found in the South African Negroid population. Numerous haplotypes, not previously described in Europeans, were, however, found. It thus seems likely that only a small number of these " African " chromosomes were present in the progenitors of all non-African peoples. These data provide support for the " out of Africa " model for the origin of modern humans and suggest that the rare ancestral DM mutation event may have occurred after the migration from Africa, hence the absence of DM in sub-Saharan Negroid peoples..
The association between tranexamic acid and convulsive seizures after cardiac surgery: a multivariate analysis in 11 529 patients.
The association of cocaine and amphetamine use with hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke is based almost solely on data from case series. The limited number of epidemiologic studies of stroke and use of cocaine and/or amphetamine have been done in settings that serve mostly the poor and/or minorities. This case-control study was conducted in the defined population comprising members of Kaiser Permanente of Northern and Southern California. We attempted to identify all incident strokes in women ages 15-44 years during a 3-year period using hospital admission and discharge records, emergency department logs, and payment requests for out-of-plan hospitalizations. We selected controls, matched on age and facility of usual care, at random from healthy members of the health plan. We obtained information in face-to-face interviews. There were 347 confirmed stroke cases and 1,021 controls. The univariate matched odds ratio for stroke in women who admitted to using cocaine and/or amphetamine was 8.5 (95% confidence interval = 3.6-20.0). After further adjustment for potential confounders, the odds ratio in women who reported using cocaine and/or amphetamine was 7.0 (95% confidence interval = 2.8-17.9). The use of cocaine and/or amphetamine is a strong risk factor for stroke in this socioeconomically heterogeneous, insured urban population.
The asymmetrical breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was studied in female rats. Paw preference was assessed by a food reaching test. Adrenaline-induced hypertension was used to destroy the BBB, which was evaluated using triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) staining of the brain slices just after giving adrenaline for 30 s. In normal rats, the whole brain sections exhibited complete staining with TTC. After adrenaline infusion for 30 s, there were large unstained areas in the left brain in right-pawed animals, and vice versa in left-pawed animals. Similar results were obtained in seizure-induced breakdown of BBB. These results were explained by an asymmetric cerebral blood flow depending upon the paw preference in rats. It was suggested that this new method and the results are consistent with contralateral motor control that may be important in determining the dominant cerebral hemisphere in animals.
The ataxia-telangiectasia gene product, a constitutively expressed nuclear protein that is not up-regulated following genome damage.
The attenuating effect of carteolol hydrochloride, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy in rats.
The authors describe the case of a 56-year-old woman with chronic, severe heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy and absence of significant ventricular arrhythmias who developed QT prolongation and torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia during one cycle of intermittent low dose (2.5 mcg/kg per min) dobutamine. This report of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia during intermittent dobutamine supports the hypothesis that unpredictable fatal arrhythmias may occur even with low doses and in patients with no history of significant rhythm disturbances. The mechanisms of proarrhythmic effects of Dubutamine are discussed.
The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse B-cell gastric lymphoma and myotonic dystrophy, the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, and sudden atrial fibrillation following one cycle of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in the same patient. Atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias are unusual complications in patients treated with chemotherapy. The cardiac toxicity intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy employed could function as a triggering factor for the arrhythmia in the predisposed myocardium of this patient.
The authors present a case of early (within 4 days) development of torsade de pointes (TdP) associated with oral amiodarone therapy. Consistent with other reports this case of TdP occurred in the context of multiple exacerbating factors including hypokalemia and digoxin excess. Transient prolongation of the QT during bladder irrigation prompted the episode of TdP. It is well known that bradycardia exacerbates acquired TdP. The authors speculate that the increased vagal tone during bladder irrigation, a vagal maneuver, in the context of amiodarone therapy resulted in amiodarone-induced proarrhythmia. In the absence of amiodarone therapy, a second bladder irrigation did not induce TdP despite hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
The authors present three patients with de novo absence epilepsy after administration of carbamazepine and vigabatrin. Despite the underlying diseases, the prognosis for drug-induced de novo absence seizure is good because it subsides rapidly after discontinuing the use of the offending drugs. The gamma-aminobutyric acid-transmitted thalamocortical circuitry accounts for a major part of the underlying neurophysiology of the absence epilepsy. Because drug-induced de novo absence seizure is rare, pro-absence drugs can only be considered a promoting factor. The underlying epileptogenecity of the patients or the synergistic effects of the accompanying drugs is required to trigger the de novo absence seizure. The possibility of drug-induced aggravation should be considered whenever an unexpected increase in seizure frequency and/or new seizure types appear following a change in drug treatment. By understanding the underlying mechanism of absence epilepsy, we can avoid the inappropriate use of anticonvulsants in children with epilepsy and prevent drug-induced absence seizures.
The authors report 2 cases of premature neonates who had enterocutaneous fistula complicating necrotizing enterocolitis. Pulmonary hypertension developed after administration of a somatostatin analogue, octreotide, to enhance resolution of the fistula. The authors discuss the mechanism of the occurrence of this complication and recommend caution of its use in high-risk premature neonates.
The authors report a mutation in exon 5 of GCH1 in a patient with adult-onset oromandibular dystonia and no obvious family history of dystonia. The patient responded positively to treatment with L-dopa. These findings demonstrate that GCH1 mutations must be considered even in patients with dystonic symptoms not typical of dopa-responsive dystonia.
The authors reviewed reported cases of antibiotic-induced manic episodes by means of a MEDLINE and PsychLit search for reports of antibiotic-induced mania. Unpublished reports were requested from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Twenty-one reports of antimicrobial-induced mania were found in the literature. There were 6 cases implicating clarithromycin, 13 implicating isoniazid, and 1 case each implicating erythromycin and amoxicillin. The WHO reported 82 cases. Of these, clarithromycin was implicated in 23 (27.6%) cases, ciprofloxacin in 12 (14.4%) cases, and ofloxacin in 10 (12%) cases. Cotrimoxazole, metronidazole, and erythromycin were involved in 15 reported manic episodes. Cases reported by the FDA showed clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin to be the most frequently associated with the development of mania. Statistical analysis of the data would not have demonstrated a significant statistical correlative risk and was therefore not undertaken. Patients have an increased risk of developing mania while being treated with antimicrobials. Although this is not a statistically significant risk, physicians must be aware of the effect and reversibility. Further research clearly is required to determine the incidence of antimicrobial-induced mania, the relative risk factors of developing an antimicrobial-induced manic episode among various demographic populations, and the incidence of patients who continue to have persistent affective disorders once the initial episode, which occurs while the patient is taking antibiotics, subsides. The authors elected to name this syndrome "antibiomania."
The axonal chemoattractant netrin-1 guides spinal commissural axons by activating its receptor DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer ). We have found that chemical inhibitors of metalloproteases potentiate netrin-mediated axon outgrowth in vitro. We have also found that DCC is a substrate for metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding, and that the inhibitors block proteolytic processing of DCC and cause an increase in DCC protein levels on axons within spinal cord explants. Thus, potentiation of netrin activity by inhibitors may result from stabilization of DCC on the axons, and proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration by controlling the number of functional extracellular axon guidance receptors..
The beta adrenergic blocking drug, timolol, tended to correct the hypokalemia of short-term bendrofluazide treatment in 6 healthy male subjects and although the effect was small it was significant. Timolol also reduced the rise in plasma aldosterone and urine potassium excretion following bendrofluazide and increased the urine sodium/potassium ratio. There was no evidence of a shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space.
The beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) are G protein-coupled receptors activated by epinephrine and norepinephrine and are involved in a variety of their physiological functions. Previously, three beta-AR genes (ADRB1, ADRB2 and ADRB3) were resequenced, identifying polymorphisms that were used in genetic association studies of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. These studies have produced intriguing but inconsistent results, potentially because the known functional variants: ADRB1 Arg389Gly and Gly49Ser, ADRB2 Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, and ADRB3 Arg64Trp provided an incomplete picture of the total functional diversity at these genes. Therefore, we created marker panels for each beta-AR gene that included the known functional markers and also other markers evenly spaced and with sufficient density to identify haplotype block structure and to maximize haplotype diversity. A total of 27 markers were genotyped in 96 US Caucasians and 96 African Americans. In both populations and for each gene, a single block with little evidence of historical recombination was observed. For each gene, haplotype captured most of the information content of each functional locus, even if that locus was not genotyped, and presumably haplotype would capture the signal from unknown functional loci whose alleles are of moderate abundance. This study demonstrates the utility of using beta-AR gene haplotype maps and marker panels as tools for linkage studies on beta-AR function.
The beta-catenin signal transduction pathway, which can be activated by secreted Wnt proteins, plays a key role in normal embryonic development and in malignant transformation of the mammary gland and colon. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that Wnt and beta-catenin signaling also function in cells of the vasculature. RT-PCR analysis showed that primary endothelial and smooth muscle cell cultures, of both mouse and human origin, express members of the Wnt and Wnt receptor (Frizzled) gene families. Transfection of an expression vector for Wnt-1 into primary endothelial cells increased both the free pool of beta-catenin and the transcription from a Lef/tcf-dependent reporter gene construct. Expression of Wnt-1, but not Wnt-5a, also stimulated proliferation of primary endothelial cell cultures. These data show that Wnt and Frizzled proteins can regulate signal transduction, via beta-catenin, in endothelial cells. These findings suggest that Wnt signaling may feature in normal differentiation of the vasculature as well as in pathological settings where endothelial and smooth muscle proliferation is disturbed.

The beta-subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI-beta) on chromosome 11 is maternally linked to atopy, the state of enhanced IgE responsiveness underlying allergic asthma and rhinitis. We have identified a common variant of Fc epsilon RI-beta, lle181Leu within the 4th transmembrane domain. Leu181 shows significant association with positive IgE responses in a random patient sample. Amongst 60 unrelated nuclear families with allergic asthmatic probands, Leu181 is identified in 10 (17%), is maternally inherited in each, and shows a strong association with atopy. Our data indicate that Fc epsilon RI-beta, subject to maternal modification, may be the atopy-causing locus on chromosome 11q.
The biological properties of the optical isomers of propranolol and their effects on cardiac arrhythmias.
The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 encodes a zinc finger protein of unknown function. Association of the BRCA1 protein with the DNA repair protein Rad51 and changes in the phosphorylation and cellular localization of the protein after exposure to DNA-damaging agents are consistent with a role for BRCA1 in DNA repair. Here, it is shown that mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in BRCA1 are defective in the ability to carry out transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage, and are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and hydrogen peroxide. These results suggest that BRCA1 participates, directly or indirectly, in transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage..
The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, has been cloned and shown to encode a zinc-finger protein of unknown function. Mutations in BRCA1 account for at least 80% of families with both breast and ovarian cancer, as well as some non-familial sporadic ovarian cancers. The loss of wild-type BRCA1 in tumours of individuals carrying one nonfunctional BRCA1 allele suggests that BRCA1 encodes a tumour suppressor that may inhibit the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. To examine the role of BRCA1 in normal tissue growth and differentiation, and to generate a potential model for the cancer susceptibility associated with loss of BRCA1 function, we have created a mouse line carrying a mutation in one Brca1 allele. Analysis of mice homozygous for the mutant allele indicate that Brca1 is critical for normal development, as these mice died in utero between 10 and 13 days of gestation (E10-E13). Abnormalities in Brca1-deficient embryos were most evident in the neural tube, with 40% of the embryos presenting with varying degrees of spina bifida and anencephaly. In addition, the neuroepithelium in Brca1-deficient embryos appeared disorganized, with signs of both rapid proliferation and excessive cell death..
The breast cancer specific tumour suppressor protein, BRCA1 (refs 1,2), activates transcription when linked with a DNA-binding domain and is a component of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) holoenzyme. We show here that RNA helicase A (RHA) protein links BRCA1 to the holoenzyme complex. The region of BRCA1 which interacts with RHA and, thus, the holoenzyme complex, corresponds to subregions of the BRCT domain of BRCA1 (ref. 9). This interaction was shown to occur in yeast nuclei, and expression in human cells of a truncated RHA molecule which retains binding to BRCA1 inhibited transcriptional activation mediated by the BRCA1 carboxy terminus. These data are the first to identify a specific protein interaction with the BRCA1 C-terminal domain and are consistent with the model that BRCA1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator.
The breast-ovary cancer-family syndrome is a dominant predisposition to cancer of the breast and ovaries which has been mapped to chromosome region 17q12-q21. The majority, but not all, of breast-ovary cancer families show linkage to this susceptibility locus, designated BRCA1. We report here the results of a linkage analysis of 145 families with both breast and ovarian cancer. These families contain either a total of three or more cases of early-onset (before age 60 years) breast cancer or ovarian cancer. All families contained at least one case of ovarian cancer. Overall, an estimated 76% of the 145 families are linked to the BRCA1 locus. None of the 13 families with cases of male breast cancer appear to be linked, but it is estimated that 92% (95% confidence interval 76% -100%) of families with no male breast cancer and with two or more ovarian cancers are linked to BRCA1. These data suggest that the breast-ovarian cancer-family syndrome is genetically heterogeneous. However, the large majority of families with early-onset breast cancer and with two or more cases of ovarian cancer are likely to be due to BRCA1 mutations..
The bronchodilator effects of a single dose of ipratropium bromide aerosol (36 micrograms) and short-acting theophylline tablets (dose titrated to produce serum levels of 10-20 micrograms/mL) were compared in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 21 patients with stable, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mean peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increases over baseline and the proportion of patients attaining at least a 15% increase in the FEV1 (responders) were 31% and 90%, respectively, for ipratropium and 17% and 50%, respectively, for theophylline. The average FEV1 increases during the 6-hour observation period were 18% for ipratropium and 8% for theophylline. The mean duration of action was 3.8 hours with ipratropium and 2.4 hours with theophylline. While side effects were rare, those experienced after theophylline use did involve the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. These results show that ipratropium is a more potent bronchodilator than oral theophylline in patients with chronic airflow obstruction.
The cDNA clone encoding a novel isoform of protein kinase PKN, termed PKNbeta, was isolated from a HeLa cDNA library. PKNbeta had high sequence homology with PKNalpha, originally isolated PKN, especially in the repeats of charged amino acid-rich region with leucine-zipper like sequences (CZ region/HR1), in the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain, and in approximately 130 amino acid stretch (D region/HR2), located between CZ region/HR1 and the catalytic domain. However, the amino acid sequence of PKNbeta differed from that of PKNalpha in the region immediately amino-terminal to the catalytic domain, which contained two distinct proline-rich sequences consistent with the class II consensus sequence, PXXPXR, for binding to SH3 domain. Distribution of PKNbeta differed from that of PKNalpha in the following two respects: (1) Northern blotting indicated that PKNbeta mRNA could not be detected in human adult tissues, but was expressed abundantly in human cancer cell lines; (2) immunochemical analysis indicated that PKNbeta localized in nucleus and perinuclear Golgi apparatus, and was almost absent in cytoplasmic region in NIH3T3 cells. Recombinant PKNbeta expressed in COS7 cells displayed autophosphorylation and peptide kinase activity, but was found to be significantly less responsive to arachidonic acid than PKNalpha. The identification of this novel isoform underscores the diversity of PKN signaling pathway.
The cDNA encoding human ferrochelatase [EC 4.99.1.1] was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library in bacteriophage lambda gt11 by screening with a radiolabeled fragment of mouse ferrochelatase cDNA. The cDNA had an open reading frame of 1269 base pairs (bp) encoding a protein of 423 amino acid residues (Mr. 47,833) with alternative putative polyadenylation signals in the 3' non-coding regions and poly (A) tails. Amino acid sequencing showed that the mature protein consists of 369 amino acid residues (Mr. 42,158) with a putative leader sequence of 54 amino acid residues. The human enzyme showed an 88% identity to mouse enzyme and 46% to yeast enzyme. Northern blot analysis showed two mRNAs of about 2500 and 1600 bp for ferrochelatase in K562 and HepG2 cells. As full-length cDNA for human ferrochelatase is now available, molecular lesions related to erythropoietic protoporphyria can be characterized.
The cDNA encoding the catalytic polypeptide of human DNA polymerase epsilon was cloned. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals that the catalytic polypeptide is 2257 amino acids in length and its calculated molecular mass is 258 kDa. A single RNA message of 7.5 kilobases was recognized by isolated cDNA clones. The identity of the cDNA was verified by direct amino acid sequencing of tryptic fragments derived from the catalytic polypeptide of the HeLa DNA polymerase epsilon. The primary structure comparison with multiple DNA polymerases indicates that human DNA polymerase epsilon catalytic polypeptide is a homolog of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase II catalytic polypeptide. The proteins are 39% identical. In the region containing known DNA polymerase consensus motifs, the identity is 63%. The expression of the mRNA encoding DNA polymerase epsilon is strongly dependent on cell proliferation.
The cDNA for the PSST subunit of human mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH): ubiquinone oxidoreductase was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of human cDNA. The sequence of the mature protein deduced from the cDNA codes for a protein that is closely related to the bovine protein (93% homology). Nine conservative substitutions are found in the mature protein, mainly in the N and C terminal regions. The mature human protein is missing four amino acids (PAAL) close to the N terminus that are present in the bovine protein. The N terminus of the mature protein is preceded by a presequence of 38 amino acids that, although quite different from its bovine counterpart (52% homology), has properties that are characteristic of a mitochondrial import sequence. Southern hybridization analysis predicts an estimated gene size of 3.8 kb. Northern hybridization analysis of mRNA from fibroblasts of complex I-deficient patients revealed no size or transcript level abnormalities. The cDNA of the PSST protein was used to investigate tissue-specific expression and to localize the gene for this subunit to chromosome 19p13.
The cardiomyopathy (CM) produced by the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DXR) (Adriamycin) provides a unique opportunity to analyze dose-effect and structure-function relationships during development of myocardial disease. We measured the degree of morphologic damage by ultrastructural examination of endomyocardial biopsy and the degree of performance abnormally by right heart catheterization in patients receiving DXR. Morphologic damage was variable but was proportional to the total cumulative DXR dose between 100 and 600 mg/m2. Performance abnormalities correlated weakly with dose, exhibited a curvilinear relationship, and had a "threshold" for expression. Catheterization abnormalities correlated well with morphologic damage (r = 0.57 to 0.78) in a subgroup of patients in whom exercise hemodynamics were measured, and this relationship also exhibited a curvilinear, threshold configuration. In DXR-CM myocardial damage is proportional to the degree of cytotoxic insult (DXR dose) while myocardial function is preserved until a critical dose or degree of damage is reached, after which myocardial performance deteriorates rapidly.
The cardioprotective effect of the ethanol extract of Picrorrhiza kurroa rhizomes and roots (PK) on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats with respect to lipid metabolism in serum and heart tissue has been investigated. Oral pre-treatment with PK (80 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 15 days) significantly prevented the isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction and maintained the rats at near normal status.
The cardiotoxic effects of adriamycin were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system. Adriamycin inhibited cell growth and the rhythmic contractions characteristic of myocardial cells in culture. A possible involvement of energy metabolism was suggested previously, and in this study the adenylate energy charge and phosphorylcreatine mole fraction were determined in the adriamycin-treated cells. The adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly decreased, while the phophorylcreatine mole fraction was unchanged. Such disparity suggests an inhibition of creatine phosphokinase. The addition of 1 mM adenosine to the myocardial cell cultures markedly increases the ATP concentration through a pathway reportedly leading to a compartmentalized ATP pool. In the adriamycin-treated cells, the addition of adenosine increased the adenylate charge and, concomitant with this inrcease, the cells' functional integrity, in terms of percentage of beating cells and rate of contractions, was maintained.
The cardiovascular effects of hypoglycaemia, with and without beta-blockade, were compared in fourteen healthy men. Eight received insulin alone, and eight, including two of the original insulin-only group, were given propranolol and insulin. In the insulin-group the period of hypoglycaemia was associated with an increase in heart-rate and a fall in diastolic blood-pressure. In the propranolol-insulin group there was a significant fall in heart-rate in most subjects and an increase in diastolic pressure. Typical S-T/T changes occurred in the insulin-group but in none of the propranolol-insulin group. Hypertension in diabetics prone to hypoglycaemia attacks should not be treated with beta-blockers because these drugs may cause a sharp rise in blood-pressure in such patients.
The cargo that the molecular motor kinesin moves along microtubules has been elusive. We searched for binding partners of the COOH terminus of kinesin light chain, which contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. Three proteins were found, the c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting proteins (JIPs) JIP-1, JIP-2, and JIP-3, which are scaffolding proteins for the JNK signaling pathway. Concentration of JIPs in nerve terminals requires kinesin, as evident from the analysis of JIP COOH-terminal mutants and dominant negative kinesin constructs. Coprecipitation experiments suggest that kinesin carries the JIP scaffolds preloaded with cytoplasmic (dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase) and transmembrane signaling molecules (the Reelin receptor, ApoER2). These results demonstrate a direct interaction between conventional kinesin and a cargo, indicate that motor proteins are linked to their membranous cargo via scaffolding proteins, and support a role for motor proteins in spatial regulation of signal transduction pathways.
The carrier frequency of the BRCA1 185delAG mutation is approximately 1 percent in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals.
The case of a 40-year-old patient who underwent an unsuccessful cadaver kidney transplantation and was treated with ethambutol and isoniazid is reported. A bilateral retrobulbar neuropathy with an unusual central bitemporal hemianopic scotoma was found. Ethambutol was stopped and only small improvement of the visual acuity followed. Isoniazid was discontinued later, followed by a dramatic improvement in the visual acuity. The hazards of optic nerve toxicity due to ethambutol are known. We emphasize the potential danger in the use of ethambutol and isoniazid.
The case of an 11-year-old boy is reported who was known to have Fanconi's anemia for 3 years and was treated with androgens, corticosteroids and transfusions. Two weeks before his death he was readmitted because of aplastic crisis with septicemia and marked abnormalities in liver function and died of hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia. At autopsy peliosis and multiple hepatic tumors were found which histologically proved to be well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. This case contributes to the previous observations that non-metastasizing hepatic neoplasms and peliosis can develop in patients with androgen- and corticosteroid-treated Fanconi's anemia.
The catalytic domain of serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase (SGK) is 54% identical with protein kinase B (PKB) and, like PKB, is activated in vitro by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and in vivo in response to signals that activate phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. Here we identify two novel isoforms of SGK, termed SGK2 and SGK3, whose catalytic domains share 80% amino acid sequence identity with each other and with SGK (renamed SGK1). Like SGK1, the mRNA encoding SGK3 is expressed in all tissues examined, but SGK2 mRNA is only present at significant levels in liver, kidney and pancreas and, at lower levels, in the brain. The levels of SGK2 mRNA in H4IIE cells and SGK3 mRNA in Rat2 fibroblasts are not increased by stimulation with serum or dexamethasone, whereas the level of SGK1 mRNA is increased greatly. SGK2 and SGK3 are activated in vitro by PDK1, albeit more slowly than SGK1, and their activation is accompanied by the phosphorylation of Thr(193) and Thr(253) respectively, the residues equivalent to the Thr in the 'activation loop' of PKB that is targeted by PDK1. The PDK1-catalysed phosphorylation and activation of SGK2 and SGK3, like SGK1, is greatly potentiated by mutating Ser(356) and Ser(419) respectively to Asp, these residues being equivalent to the C-terminal phosphorylation site of PKB. Like SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3 are activated 5-fold via a phosphorylation mechanism when cells are exposed to H(2)O(2) but, in contrast with SGK1, activation is only suppressed partially by inhibitors of PI 3-kinase. SGK2 and SGK3 are activated to a smaller extent by insulin-like growth factor-1 (2-fold) than SGK1 (5-fold). Like PKB and SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3 preferentially phosphorylate Ser and Thr residues that lie in Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Ser/Thr motifs.
The cause of hearing loss after spinal anaesthesia is unknown. Up until now, the only factor studied has been the effect of the diameter of the spinal needle on post-operative sensorineural hearing loss. The aim of this study was to describe this hearing loss and to investigate other factors influencing the degree of hearing loss. Two groups of 22 similar patients were studied: one group received 6 mL prilocaine 2%; and the other received 3 mL bupivacaine 0.5%. Patients given prilocaine were more likely to develop hearing loss (10 out of 22) than those given bupivacaine (4 out of 22) (P < 0.05). The average hearing loss for speech frequencies was about 10 dB after prilocaine and 15 dB after bupivacaine. None of the patients complained of subjective hearing loss. Long-term follow-up of the patients was not possible.
The central nervous system toxicity of high-dose cytosine arabinoside is well recognized, but the toxicity of cytosine arabinoside in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported. A 49-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. After he achieved complete remission, he received high-dose cytosine arabinoside treatment (2 g/m2 twice a day for 5 days; total, 20 g/m2) as consolidation therapy. The first course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside resulted in no unusual symptoms, but on day 21 of the second course of treatment, the patient complained of numbness in his right foot. Electromyogram and nerve-conduction studies showed peripheral neuropathy in both peroneal nerves. This neuropathy was gradually resolving; however, after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the symptoms worsened, with the development of graft-versus-host disease, and the symptoms subsequently responded to methylprednisolone. Although the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy are still unclear, high-dose cytosine arabinoside is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system, and auto/alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms.
The chemokine beta family is comprised of at least six distinct cytokines that regulate trafficking of phagocytes and lymphocytes in mammalian species; at least one of these, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), also regulates the growth of hematopoietic stem cells. We now show that MIP-1 alpha and the related beta chemokine, RANTES, induce transient alterations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in polymorphonuclear leukocytes that can be reciprocally and specifically desensitized, suggesting a common receptor. Moreover, we have now cloned both the cDNA and the gene for this receptor, functionally expressed the receptor in Xenopus oocytes, and mapped the gene to human chromosome 3p21. Transcripts for the receptor were found in mature and immature myeloid cells as well as B cells. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. It has approximately 33% amino acid identity with receptors for the alpha chemokine, interleukin 8, and may be the human homologue of the product of US28, an open reading frame of human cytomegalovirus.
The chitinase 3-like 1 gene (CHI3L1) is abnormally expressed in the hippocampus of subjects with schizophrenia and may be involved in the cellular response to various environmental events that are reported to increase the risk of schizophrenia. Here, we provide evidence that the functional variants at the CHI3L1 locus influence the genetic risk of schizophrenia. First, using case-control and transmission/disequilibrium-test (TDT) methodologies, we detected a significant association between schizophrenia and haplotypes within the promoter region of CHI3L1 in two independent cohorts of Chinese individuals. Second, the at-risk CCC haplotype (P=.00058 and .0018 in case-control and TDT studies, respectively) revealed lower transcriptional activity (P=2.2 x 10(-7)) and was associated with lower expression (P=3.1 x 10(-5)) compared with neutral and protective haplotypes. Third, we found that an allele of SNP4 (rs4950928), the tagging SNP of CCC, impaired the MYC/MAX-regulated transcriptional activation of CHI3L1 by altering the transcriptional-factor consensus sequences, and this may be responsible for the decreased expression of the CCC haplotype. In contrast, the protective TTG haplotype was associated with a high level of CHI3L1 expression. Our findings identify CHI3L1 as a potential schizophrenia-susceptibility gene and suggest that the genes involved in the biological response to adverse environmental conditions are likely to play roles in the predisposition to schizophrenia.
The choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activator, which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of acetylcholine (ACh), is an important factor in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect (46%) on ChAT in vitro. Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana, the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein (4',7-dihydroxy-isoflavone). In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine-induced impairments of learning and memory, we conducted a series of in vivo tests. Administration of daidzein (4.5 mg/kg body weight) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia, according to the results of a Y-maze test. Injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y-maze tests (a 37% decreases in alternation behavior). By way of contrast, mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment (an approximately 12%-21% decrease in alternation behavior). These results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a ChAT activator, and that it also ameliorates scopolamine-induced amnesia.
The chromosomal changes in eight familial BRCAx breast cancers (i.e., negative for BRCA1 or BRCA2) were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to investigate intratumor heterogeneity. This was the first step in a study of most frequent chromosomal aberrations in BRCAx familial breast cancers. Laser microdissection analysis of paraffin tissue samples was followed by whole-genome amplification. CGH was performed on DNA isolated from two to three different cell groups per case to detect any cytogenetic aberrations in important clones that might have been missed when analyzing DNA extracted from large numbers of cells. The results were compared, to evaluate the influence of tumor heterogeneity on CGH, and the heterogeneity was confirmed comparing CGH with fluorescence in situ hybridization results. Different chromosomal aberrations were detected between adjacent clones within the same section, which highlights the utility of microdissection in addressing the problem of heterogeneity in whole-genome studies. Some chromosomal regions were more frequently altered in the eight BRCAx tumors; loss of 2q, 3p, 3q, 8p, 9p, and 15q and gains of 1p, 4p, 4q, 5p, 6q, 12q, and 19p were the most common. Further studies focusing on specific genes and sequences with more sensitive approaches, such as array-CGH, are warranted to confirm these findings.
The chromosomal order of genes controlling the major histocompatibility complex, properdin factor B, and deficiency of the second component of complement.
The chromosomal region 12q24 has been previously implicated by linkage studies of both bipolar disorder and unipolar mood disorder and we have reported two pedigrees segregating both bipolar disorder and Darier's disease that show linkage across this region. The gene P2RX7 is located in this chromosomal region and has been recently reported as a susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder and unipolar depression. The non-synonymous SNP rs2230912 (resulting in amino-acid polymorphism Q460R) showed the strongest association and has been postulated to be pathogenically relevant. We have investigated this gene in a large UK case-control sample (bipolar I disorder N = 687, unipolar recurrent major depression N = 1,036, controls N = 1,204). Neither rs2230912 nor any of 8 other SNPs genotyped across P2RX7 was found to be associated with mood disorder in general, nor specifically with bipolar or unipolar disorder. Further, sequencing of our two chromosome 12-linked bipolar-Darier families showed no evidence of rare variants at P2RX7 that could explain the linkage. Our data do not provide support for rs2230912 or the other polymorphisms studied within the P2RX7 locus, being involved in susceptibility to mood disorders.
The chromosome 22q11 region is susceptible to rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders and malignant tumors. Three congenital anomaly disorders, cat-eye syndrome, der () syndrome and velo-cardio-facial syndrome/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS) are associated with tetrasomy, trisomy or monosomy, respectively, for part of chromosome 22q11. VCFS/DGS is the most common syndrome associated with 22q11 rearrangements. In order to determine whether there are particular regions on 22q11 that are prone to rearrangements, the deletion end-points in a large number of VCFS/DGS patients were defined by haplotype analysis. Most VCFS/DGS patients have a similar 3 Mb deletion, some have a nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting in a 1. 5 Mb deletion and a few rare patients have unique deletions or translocations. The high prevalence of the disorder in the population and the fact that most cases occur sporadically suggest that sequences at or near the breakpoints confer susceptibility to chromosome rearrangements. To investigate this hypothesis, we developed hamster-human somatic hybrid cell lines from VCFS/DGS patients with all three classes of deletions and we now show that the breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeats, termed LCR22s. To support this idea further, we identified a family that carries an interstitial duplication of the same 3 Mb region that is deleted in VCFS/DGS patients. We present models to explain how the LCR22s can mediate different homologous recombination events, thereby generating a number of rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders. We identified five additional copies of the LCR22 on 22q11 that may mediate other rearrangements leading to disease.
The chronic feeding of small amounts (0.3-3% of diet weight) of certain amino derivatives of caproate resulted in hyperglycemia, an elevated glucose tolerance curve and, occasionally, glucosuria. Effective compounds included norleucine, norvaline, glutamate, epsilon-aminocaproate, methionine, and leucine.
The clinical and autopsy findings in a premature baby who died of acute renal failure after therapy with gentamicin (5 mg/kg/day) and penicillin are presented. The serum gentamicin concentration had reached toxic levels when anuria developed. Numerous periodic acid Schiff (PAS) positive, diastase resistant cytoplasmic inclusion bodies which appeared as myelin figures in cytosegresomes under the electron microscope were identified in the proximal convoluted tubules. The pathological changes induced by gentamicin in the human neonatal kidneys have not been previously reported.
The clinical and radiographic features of cerebral deep venous thrombosis in a 21-year-old white woman are presented. This nulliparous patient presented with relatively mild clinical symptoms and progressing mental status changes. The only known risk factor was "low-dose" oral contraceptive pills. The magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed increased signal intensity from the internal cerebral veins, vein of Galen, and straight sinus. The diagnosis was confirmed by arterial angiography.
The clinical manifestation of myotonic dystrophy (DM) is correlated to the extent of expansion of an unstable [CTG] n DNA motif. Recent studies have demonstrated that this trinucleotide motif forms part of the last, 3 untranslated exon of a gene which potentially encodes multiple protein isoforms of a serine/threonine protein kinase (myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, DM-PK). We report here on the development of antisera against synthetic DM-PK peptide antigens and their use in biochemical and histochemical studies. Immunoreactive DM-kinase protein of 53 kD is present at low levels in skeletal and cardiac muscle extracts of DM patients and normal controls. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that DM-PK is localised prominently at sites of neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions (NMJs and MTJs) of human and rodent skeletal muscles. Furthermore, very low levels of immunoreactive DM-PK protein are present in the sarcoplasm of predominantly type I fibres in various muscles. Strikingly, presence of the protein can also be demonstrated for NMJs of muscular tissues of adult and congenital cases of DM, with no gross changes in structural organisation. Our findings provide a basis for further characterisation of the role of the kinase in protein assembly processes or signal mediation at synaptic sites and ultimately for the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of DM..
The clinical use of molecular analyses in recessive disorders relies on the exact characterization of both mutant alleles in the affected patient. This can be problematic when only part of the gene is examined or when relevant DNA alterations are not recognized by standard methods. We present a child in whom phenylketonuria was apparently caused by homozygosity for the mutation E390G in exon 11 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. However, the clinical severity of the disease was not quite as mild as expected, the mutation was not identified in the father despite confirmed paternity, and the paternal allele showed a highly unusual pattern of polymorphic markers in the PAH gene. Presence of a large deletion involving exons 9, 10 and 11 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene was confirmed by long-range PCR. Diagnostic DNA analyses should include a comprehensive examination of the whole relevant gene in the patient and confirmation of carrier status in both parents..
The clinical utility of dopamine (DA) D1 receptor agonists in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still unclear. The therapeutic use of selective DA D1 receptor agonists such as SKF-82958 (6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzaze pine hydrobromide) and A-77636 ([1R, 3S] 3-[1'-admantyl]-1-aminomethyl-3,4-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-1H-2-benzo pyran hydrochloride) seems limited because of their duration of action, which is too short for SKF-82958 (< 1 hr) and too long for A-77636 (> 20 hr, leading to behavioral tolerance). We therefore conducted the present acute dose-response study in four 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit levodopa-induced dyskinesias to evaluate the locomotor and dyskinetic effects on challenge with four doses (from 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg) of A-86929 ([-]-[5aR,11bS]-4,5,5a,6,7,11b-hexahydro-2-propyl-3-thia-5-+ ++azacyclopent-1- ena[c]phenathrene-9-10-diol), a selective and full DA D1-like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action. Levodopa and the DA D2-like receptor agonist, LY-171555 ([4aR-trans]-4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9-o-dihydro-5n-propyl-2H-pyrazo lo-3-4-quinoline hydrochloride) were also used for comparison. Acute administration of A-86929 was as efficacious in alleviating MPTP-induced parkinsonism as levodopa and LY-171555, but was less likely to reproduce the levodopa-induced dyskinesias in these animals than with either LY-171555 or subsequent challenge of levodopa. Selective stimulation of the DA D1 receptor may provide better integration of neural inputs transmitted to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (referred to as the basal ganglia output) compared with levodopa and selective DA D2 receptor agonist. Potent DA D1 receptor agents with an intermediate duration of efficacy such as A-86929 (approximately 4 hr at higher doses tested) are potential therapeutic tools in PD and merit further attention.
The co-administration of aspirin with N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide (FANFT) to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of FANFT-induced bladder carcinomas but a concomitant induction of forestomach tumors. An autoradiographic study was performed on male F-344 rats fed diet containing FANFT at a level of 0.2% and/or aspirin at a level of 0.5% to evaluate the effect of aspirin on the increased cell proliferation induced by FANFT in the forestomach and bladder. FANFT-induced cell proliferation in the bladder was significantly suppressed by aspirin co-administration after 4 weeks but not after 12 weeks. In the forestomach, and also in the liver, aspirin did not affect the FANFT-induced increase in labeling index. The present results are consistent with the carcinogenicity experiment suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in FANFT carcinogenesis in the bladder and forestomach, and that aspirin's effect on FANFT in the forestomach is not due to an irritant effect associated with increased cell proliferation. Also, there appears to be an adaptation by the rats to the chronic ingestion of aspirin.
The common hereditary forms of breast cancer have been largely attributed to the inheritance of mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. However, it is not yet clear what proportion of hereditary breast cancer is explained by BRCA1 and BRCA2 or by some other unidentified susceptibility gene (s). We describe the proportion of hereditary breast cancer explained by BRCA1 or BRCA2 in a sample of North American hereditary breast cancers and assess the evidence for additional susceptibility genes that may confer hereditary breast or ovarian cancer risk. Twenty-three families were identified through two high-risk breast cancer research programs. Genetic analysis was undertaken to establish linkage between the breast or ovarian cancer cases and markers on chromosomes 17q (BRCA1) and 13q (BRCA2). Mutation analysis in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was also undertaken in all families. The pattern of hereditary cancer in 14 (61%) of the 23 families studied was attributed to BRCA1 by a combination of linkage and mutation analyses. No families were attributed to BRCA2. Five families (22%) provided evidence against linkage to both BRCA1 and BRCA2. No BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were detected in these five families. The BRCA1 or BRCA2 status of four families (17%) could not be determined. BRCA1 and BRCA2 probably explain the majority of hereditary breast cancer that exists in the North American population. However, one or more additional genes may yet be found that explain some proportion of hereditary breast cancer..
The complement protein C1q, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and pulmonary surfactant protein A (SPA) are structurally similar molecules that enhance phagocytic function in vitro. Monoclonal antibodies R3 and R139, which inhibit the enhancement triggered by these three ligands, were used to purify a 126,000 M(r) cell surface protein designated C1qR(P). Amino acid sequence was obtained and the corresponding cDNA was cloned. C1qR(P) is a novel type I membrane protein with the following putative structural elements: a C-type carbohydrate recognition domain, five EGF-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. All peptides identified by amino acid sequencing are encoded by the cDNA. Additionally, an anti-peptide antiserum was generated, which is reactive with C1qR(P). The data indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes the receptor that plays a role in C1q/MBL/SPA-mediated removal or destruction of pathogens and immune complexes by phagocytosis.
The compound GYKI-41 099, as a beta-adrenergic antagonist, is 3-8 times more potent than propranolol in vitro and in vivo. Its antiarrhythmic effectiveness surpasses that of propranolol and pindolol inhibiting the ouabain arrhythmia in dogs and cats. GYKI-41 900 has a negligible cardiodepressant activity; it is not cardioselective. The compound shows a rapid and long lasting effect. There was a prolonged elimination of the radioactivity after the injection of 14C-41 099 to rats and dogs. The half life of the unlabeled substance in humans was more than 10 hours.
The contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to inherited breast cancer was assessed by linkage and mutation analysis in 237 families, each with at least four cases of breast cancer, collected by the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium. Families were included without regard to the occurrence of ovarian or other cancers. Overall, disease was linked to BRCA1 in an estimated 52% of families, to BRCA2 in 32% of families, and to neither gene in 16% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6% -28%), suggesting other predisposition genes. The majority (81%) of the breast-ovarian cancer families were due to BRCA1, with most others (14%) due to BRCA2. Conversely, the majority of families with male and female breast cancer were due to BRCA2 (76%). The largest proportion (67%) of families due to other genes was found in families with four or five cases of female breast cancer only. These estimates were not substantially affected either by changing the assumed penetrance model for BRCA1 or by including or excluding BRCA1 mutation data. Among those families with disease due to BRCA1 that were tested by one of the standard screening methods, mutations were detected in the coding sequence or splice sites in an estimated 63% (95% CI 51% -77%). The estimated sensitivity was identical for direct sequencing and other techniques. The penetrance of BRCA2 was estimated by maximizing the LOD score in BRCA2-mutation families, over all possible penetrance functions. The estimated cumulative risk of breast cancer reached 28% (95% CI 9% -44%) by age 50 years and 84% (95% CI 43% -95%) by age 70 years. The corresponding ovarian cancer risks were 0. 4% (95% CI 0% -1%) by age 50 years and 27% (95% CI 0% -47%) by age 70 years. The lifetime risk of breast cancer appears similar to the risk in BRCA1 carriers, but there was some suggestion of a lower risk in BRCA2 carriers < 50 years of age.
The correlation between high serum tricyclic antidepressant concentrations and central nervous system side effects has been well established. Only a few reports exist, however, on the relationship between the serum concentrations of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and their toxic effects. In some cases, a high serum concentration of citalopram (> 600 nmol/L) in elderly patients has been associated with increased somnolence and movement difficulties. Widespread cognitive disorders, such as delirium, have not been previously linked with high blood levels of SSRIs. In this report, we describe a patient with acute hyperkinetic delirium connected with a high serum total fluoxetine (fluoxetine plus desmethylfluoxetine) concentration.
The correlation between neuropathic damage and inhibition of neurotoxic esterase or neuropathy target enzyme (NTE) was examined in rats acutely exposed to Mipafox (N, N'-diisopropylphosphorodiamidofluoridate), a neurotoxic organophosphate. Brain and spinal cord NTE activities were measured in Long-Evans male rats 1 hr post-exposure to various dosages of Mipafox (ip, 1-15 mg/kg). These data were correlated with histologically scored cervical cord damage in a separate group of similarly dosed rats sampled 14-21 days post-exposure. Those dosages (greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg) that inhibited mean NTE activity in the spinal cord greater than or equal to 73% and brain greater than or equal to 67% of control values produced severe (greater than or equal to 3) cervical cord pathology in 85% of the rats. In contrast, dosages of Mipafox (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61% and brain less than or equal to 60% produced this degree of cord damage in only 9% of the animals. These data indicate that a critical percentage of NTE inhibition in brain and spinal cord sampled shortly after Mipafox exposure can predict neuropathic damage in rats several weeks later.
The correlation between neurotoxic esterase inhibition and mipafox-induced neuropathic damage in rats.
The cure rate of infections in cancer patients is adversely affected by neutropenia (less than 1,000/mm3). In particular, patients with severe neutropenia (less than 100/mm3) have shown a poor response to antibiotics. To overcome the adverse effects of neutropenia, tobramycin was given by continuous infusion and combined with intermittent carbenicillin. Tobramycin was given to a total daily dose of 300 mg/m2 and carbenicillin was given at a dose of 5 gm every four hours. There were 125 infectious episodes in 116 cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The overall cure rate was 70%. Pneumonia was the most common infection and 61% of 59 episodes were cured. Gram-negative bacilli were the most common causative organisms and 69% of these infections were cured. The most common pathogen was Klebsiella pneumoniae and this, together with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, accounted for 74% of all gram-negative bacillary infections. Response was not influenced by the initial neutrophil count, with a 62% cure rate for 39 episodes associated with severe neutropenia. However, failure of the neutrophil count to increase during therapy adversely affected response. Azotemia was the major side effect recognized, and it occurred in 11% of episodes. Major azotemia (serum creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl or BUN greater than 50 mg/dl) occurred in only 2%. Azotemia was not related to duration of therapy or serum tobramycin concentration. This antibiotic regimen showed both therapeutic efficacy and acceptable renal toxicity for these patients.
The current study dealt with the protective role of mangiferin, a polyphenol from Mangifera indica Linn. (Anacardiaceae), on isoproterenol (ISPH)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats through its antioxidative mechanism. Subcutaneous injection of ISPH (200 mg/kg body weight in 1 ml saline) to rats for 2 consecutive days caused myocardial damage in rat heart, which was determined by the increased activity of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), increased uric acid level and reduced plasma iron binding capacity. The protective role of mangiferin was analyzed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) test used for macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of the ischemic myocardium. The heart tissue antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase activities, non-enzymic antioxidants such as cerruloplasmin, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and glutathione levels were altered in MI rats. Upon pretreatment with mangiferin (100 mg/kg body weight suspended in 2 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide) given intraperitoneally for 28 days to MI rats protected the above-mentioned parameters to fall from the normal levels. Activities of heart tissue enzymic antioxidants and serum non-enzymic antioxidants levels rose significantly upon mangiferin administration as compared to ISPH-induced MI rats. From the present study it is concluded that mangiferin exerts a beneficial effect against ISPH-induced MI due to its antioxidant potential, which regulated the tissues defense system against cardiac damage.

The dark-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) of patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) shows a marked reduction in b-wave amplitude. Genotype-phenotype studies of mouse models for DMD show position-specific effects of the mutations upon the phenotype mice with 5 defects of dystrophin have normal ERGs, those with defects in the central region have a normal b-wave amplitude associated with prolonged implicit times for both the b-wave and oscillatory potentials, and mice with 3 defects have a phenotype similar to that seen in DMD/BMD patients. The mouse studies suggest a key role for the carboxyl terminal dystrophin isoform, Dp260, in retinal electrophysiology. We have undertaken a systematic evaluation of DMD/BMD patients through clinical examination and review of the literature in order to determine whether the position-specific effects of mutations noted in the mouse are present in man. We have found that, in man, a wider variation of DMD defects correlate with reductions in the b-wave amplitude. Individuals with normal ERGs have mutations predominantly located 5 of the transcript initiation site of Dp260. Our results suggest that the most important determinant in the ERG b-wave phenotype is the mutation position, rather than muscle disease severity. Forty-six per cent of patients with mutations 5 of the Dp260 transcript start site have abnormal ERGs, as opposed to 94% with more distal mutations. The human genotype-phenotype correlations are consistent with a role for Dp260 in normal retinal electrophysiology and may also reflect the expression of other C-terminal dystrophin isoforms and their contributions to retinal signal transmission..
The degradation of mRNA is an important regulatory step in the control of gene expression. However, mammalian RNA decay pathways remain poorly characterized. To provide a framework for studying mammalian RNA decay, a two-hybrid protein interaction map was generated using 54 constructs from 38 human proteins predicted to function in mRNA decay. The results provide evidence for interactions between many different proteins required for mRNA decay. Of particular interest are interactions between the poly(A) ribonuclease and the exosome and between the Lsm complex, decapping factors, and 5'-->3' exonucleases. Moreover, multiple interactions connect 5'-->3' and 3'-->5' decay proteins to each other and to nonsense-mediated decay factors, providing the opportunity for coordination between decay pathways. The interaction network also predicts the internal organization of the exosome and Lsm complexes. Additional interactions connect mRNA decay factors to many novel proteins and to proteins required for other steps in gene expression. These results provide an experimental insight into the organization of proteins required for mRNA decay and their coupling to other cellular processes, and the physiological relevance of many of these interactions are supported by their evolutionary conservation. The interactions also provide a wealth of hypotheses to guide future research on mRNA degradation and demonstrate the power of exhaustive protein interaction mapping in aiding understanding of uncharacterized protein complexes and pathways.
The deletion 18p syndrome is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities. The medical problems are mental and postnatal growth retardation, and sometimes malformations of the heart and brain. The individuals have some typical features, which might be easy to overlook and which are: ptosis, strabismus, hypertelorism, broad flat nose, micrognathia, big and low set ears. The aims of present study were to clinically and molecularly characterize the syndrome further in seven subjects with de novo 18p deletions and to perform genotype-phenotype correlation. All seven subjects had terminal deletions and no interstitial deletion was observed with subtelomeric FISH analyses. To define the extent of the 18p deletions and the parental origin of the deletion microsatellite- and FISH analyses were performed on genomic DNA and on lymphoblastoid cell lines of the study participants. Totally 19 chromosomes, 18 specific polymorphic microsatellite markers, and 5 BAC clones were used. The results revealed that the deletions were located in the centromeric region at 18p11.1 in four of the seven subjects. In the remaining three the breakpoints were located distal to 18p11.1 (18p11.21-p11.22). Four of the individuals had a paternal and three a maternal origin of the deletion. Genotype-phenotype correlation of the seven subjects suggests a correlation between the extent of the deleted region and the mental development. All the four children with a deletion in the centromeric region at 18p11.1 had a mental retardation (MR). Two of the three children with a more distal breakpoint (distal 18p11.21) had a normal mental development and one had a border-line mental retardation. There might be a critical region for the mental retardation located between 18p11.1 and 18p11.21. The children with a breakpoint at 18p11.1 had all a broad face, which was observed in only one of those with a more distal breakpoint, otherwise no genotype-phenotype correlation of the features was observed.
The deposition of extracellular beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) in the brain is a pathologic feature of Alzheimer's disease. The beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), an integral membrane aspartyl protease responsible for cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the beta-site, promotes A beta production. A second integral membrane aspartyl protease related to BACE1, referred to as beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2) has also been demonstrated to cleave APP at the beta-cleavage site in transfected cells. The role of endogenous BACE2 in A beta production remains unresolved. We investigated the role of endogenous BACE2 in A beta production in cells by selective inactivation of its transcripts using RNA interference. We are able to reduce steady state levels for mRNA for each enzyme by >85%, and protein amounts by 88-94% in cells. Selective inactivation of BACE1 by RNA interference results in decreased beta-cleaved secreted APP and A beta peptide secretion from cells, as expected. Selective inactivation of BACE2 by RNAi results in increased beta-cleaved secreted APP and A beta peptide secretion from cells. Simultaneous targeting of both enzymes by RNA interference does not have any net effect on A beta released from cells. Our observations of changes in APP metabolism and A beta are consistent with a role of BACE2 in suppressing A beta production in cells that co-express both enzymes.
The dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-associated collagen type Ialpha1/platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain fusion gene generates a transforming protein that is processed to functional PDGF-BB.
The development of apomorphine-induced (1.0 mg/kg s.c. once daily) aggressive behavior of adult male and female Wistar rats obtained from the same breeder was studied in two consecutive sets. In male animals, repeated apomorphine treatment induced a gradual development of aggressive behavior as evidenced by the increased intensity of aggressiveness and shortened latency before the first attack toward the opponent. In female rats, only a weak tendency toward aggressiveness was found. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates gender differences in the development of the apomorphine-induced aggressive behavior and indicates that the female rats do not fill the validation criteria for use in this method.
The development of cardiac hypertrophy was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of isoproterenol (ISO) (0.3 mg/kg body weight). A time course was established for the change in tissue mass, RNA and DNA content, as well as hydroxyproline content. Heart weight increased 44% after 8 days of treatment with a half time of 3.4 days. Ventricular RNA content was elevated 26% after 24 h of a single injection and reached a maximal level following 8 days of therapy. The half time for RNA accumulation was 2.0 days. The total content of hydroxyproline remained stable during the first 2 days of treatment but increased 46% after 4 days of therapy. Ventricular DNA content was unchanged during the early stage (1-4 days) of hypertrophic growth but increased to a new steady-state level 19% above the controls after 8 days of treatment. Intraventricular pressures and coronary flow measures were similar for control and experimental animals following 4 days of developed hypertrophy. However, dP/dt in the ISO-treated hearts was slightly but significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated. These data indicate that the adaptive response to ISO shows an early hypertrophic phase (1-4 days) characterized by a substantial increase in RNA content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in DNA. However, prolonged stimulation (8-12 days) appears to represent a complex integration of both cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia within the heart.
The development of psychosis related to antiepileptic drug treatment is usually attributed to the interaction between the epileptic brain substratum and the antiepileptic drugs. The case of a nonepileptic patient who developed psychosis following phenytoin treatment for trigeminal neuralgia is described. This case suggests that the psychotic symptoms that occur following phenytoin treatment in some epileptic patients may be the direct result of medication, unrelated to seizures.
The development of schizophrenia may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events, in combination leading to overt disease. We investigated the effect of an early stress, in the form of maternal deprivation, combined with a later stress, simulated by chronic periadolescent corticosterone treatment, on behaviour in rats. Acute treatment with apomorphine caused disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or corticosterone treatment, but was surprisingly absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress. Amphetamine treatment significantly disrupted PPI in both non-deprived groups, but was absent in both maternally deprived groups. The serotonin-1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, induced a significant disruption of PPI in all groups. Amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity was similar in all groups. These results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress, caused by maternal deprivation, combined with 'adolescent' stress, simulated by corticosterone treatment, on dopaminergic regulation of PPI. The altered effects of apomorphine and amphetamine could indicate differential changes in dopamine receptor signalling leading to functional desensitisation, or altered modulation of sensory gating in the nucleus accumbens by limbic structures such as the hippocampus.
The development of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) associated with the use of cyclosporine has been well documented. Treatments have included discontinuation or reduction of cyclosporine dose with or without concurrent plasma exchange, plasma infusion, anticoagulation, and intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion. However, for recipients of organ transplantation, removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss. The last decade has seen the emergence of tacrolimus as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of cyclosporine. As a result, switching to tacrolimus has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of cyclosporine-induced TMA. With the more widespread application of tacrolimus in organ transplantation, tacrolimus-associated TMA has also been recognized. However, literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of TMA in patients exposed sequentially to cyclosporine and tacrolimus is limited. We report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed cyclosporine-induced TMA that responded to the withdrawal of cyclosporine in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma replacement therapy. Introduction of tacrolimus as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of TMA and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft. Patients who are switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus or vice versa should be closely monitored for the signs and symptoms of recurrent TMA.
The development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine was studied in rats. Saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of morphine (20 mg/kg i.p.) showed a pronounced rigidity recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram. Rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a rigidity after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic (A group). The other rats showed a strong decrease in the rigidity and the occurrence of stereotyped (S) licking and/or gnawing in presence of akinetic or hyperkinetic (K) behaviour (AS/KS group), suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation. The rigidity was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days' treatment. In a further series of experiments, haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the rigidity without any dopaminergic interference. Haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the A group. However, the level in the AS/KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group. The results suggest that rigidity, which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum, can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum. Nevertheless, there occurs some real tolerance to this effect. The rapid alternations of rigidity and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the AS/KS group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various DA-innervated structures.
The differential diagnosis of the genetic bleeding disorders, hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease, is occasionally confounded by the close molecular relationship of coagulation factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (vWF). This report describes the autosomal inheritance of a hemophilia A phenotype due to a mutation of vWF that results in defective factor VIII binding. The proband was a female patient with low levels of factor VIII activity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing were employed to examine exons encoding the putative factor VIII binding domain of vWF. The patient was found to be homozygous for a single point mutation causing a Thr-- > Met substitution at amino acid position 28 in the mature vWF subunit. The phenotypic expression of the mutation was determined to be recessive because heterozygous family members were clinically unaffected. Recombinant vWF containing the observed amino acid substitution was expressed in COS-1 cells. The mutant vWF was processed and secreted normally, and was functionally equivalent to wild-type vWF in its ability to bind to platelets. However, the mutant failed to bind factor VIII, demonstrating that the mutation was functionally related to the observed hemophilia phenotype. The family we describe demonstrates the recessive inheritance of a recently recognized class of genetic bleeding disorders, we call " autosomal hemophilia. " We conclude that vWF mutation may be an under recognized cause of hemophilia, especially in cases where the inheritance pattern is not consistent with X-linked transmission.
The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release, cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model.
The discovery of a large kindred with a heritable deficiency of the fifth component of complement (C5) has permitted the accumulation of new clinical, genetic and immunologic data concerning the role of C5 in human subjects. The proband, who has had nine episodes of disseminated gonococcal infection, has a hemolytic C5 level of approximately 0. 5 per cent of normal. No C5 protein was detectable, but low levels of functional C5 activity could be found using a sensitive bactericidal assay. The probands twin as well as another sister also had extremely low levels of hemolytic C5 (approximately 0. 5 per cent normal), but both these subjects have been healthy. Hemolytic complement and bacteriolytic activity could be restored by the addition of purified C5. No chemotactic activity for polymorphonuclear leukocytes could be generated in the C5-deficient serums upon activation of either the classic or alternative pathways, again demonstrating the importance of C5 in human subjects for the production of chemotactic factors. The chemotactic responsiveness of the patients polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes to preformed chemotactic factors was not depressed. Twenty-two of 32 other family members from three generations had depressed whole hemolytic complement levels. In 19 of 30 family members, levels of hemolytic C5 ranged from 13 to 64 per cent of normal. No linkage for C5 deficiency and the A or B loci of the major histocompatibility complex could be found. These data suggest an autosomal codominant mode of inheritance of C5 deficiency. Deficiency of C5 is compatible with good health, but it can be associated with repeated disseminated gonococcal infection
The dose-dependent effect of misoprostol on indomethacin-induced renal dysfunction in well compensated cirrhosis.
The early growth response 2 gene (EGR2) is a Cys2His2zinc finger transcription factor which is thought to play a role in the regulation of peripheral nervous system myelination. This idea is based partly on the phenotype of homozygous Krox20 (Egr2) knockout mice, which display hypomyelination of the PNS and a block of Schwann cells at an early stage of differentiation. Mutations in the human EGR2 gene have recently been associated with the inherited peripheral neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy. Three of the four EGR2 mutations are dominant and occur within the zinc finger DNA-binding domain. The fourth mutation is recessive and affects the inhibitory domain (R1) that binds the NAB transcriptional co-repressors. A combination of DNA-binding assays and transcriptional analysis was used to determine the functional consequences of these mutations. The zinc finger mutations affect DNA binding and the amount of residual binding directly correlates with disease severity. The R1 domain mutation prevents interaction of EGR2 with the NAB co-repressors and thereby increases transcriptional activity. These data provide insight into the possible disease mechanisms underlying EGR2 mutations and the reason for varying severity and differences in inheritance patterns..
The effect of a 6-week treatment with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure, albuminuria, renal hemodynamics, and morphology of the nonclipped kidney was studied in rats with two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertension. Six weeks after clipping of one renal artery, hypertensive rats (178 +/- 4 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to three groups: untreated hypertensive controls (n = 8), enalapril-treated (n = 8), or nitrendipine-treated (n = 10). Sham-operated rats served as normotensive controls (128 +/- 3 mm Hg, n = 8). After 6 weeks of treatment, renal hemodynamics (glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow) were measured in the anesthetized rats. Renal tissue was obtained for determination of glomerular size and sclerosis. Enalapril but not nitrendipine reduced blood pressure significantly. After 6 weeks of therapy, glomerular filtration rate was not different among the studied groups. Renal plasma flow increased, but albumin excretion and glomerulosclerosis did not change after enalapril treatment. In contrast, in the nitrendipine-treated group albuminuria increased from 12.8 +/- 2 progressively to 163 +/- 55 compared with 19.2 +/- 9 mg/24 hr in the hypertensive controls. Furthermore, glomerulosclerosis index was significantly increased in the nitrendipine-treated group compared with the hypertensive controls (0.38 +/- 0.1 versus 0.13 +/- 0.04). In addition, glomerular size was higher in the nitrendipine-treated group (14.9 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2) but lower in the enalapril-treated group (11.5 +/- 0.15 10(-3) mm2) compared with the hypertensive controls (12.1 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The effect of a widely used organic solvent, polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400), on the toxic action of an acute or chronic treatment with adriamycin (ADR) was evaluated in mice. PEG 400 impressively decreased both acute high-dose and chronic low-dose-ADR-associated lethality. Light microscopic analysis showed a significant protection against ADR-induced cardiac morphological alterations. Such treatment did not diminish the ADR antitumor activity in L1210 leukemia and in Ehrlich ascites tumor.
The effect of amantadine hydrochloride, injected i.p. in 6 increments of 100 mg/kg each over 30 hr, on mouse motility and whole brain content of selected biogenic amines and major metabolites was studied in 4 strains of mice. These were the albino Sprague-Dawley ICR and BALB/C, the black C57BL/6 and the brown CDF-I mouse strains. Amantadine treatment produced a biphasic effect on mouse motility. The initial dose of amantadine depressed locomotor activity in all mouse strains studied with the BALB/C mice being the most sensitive. Subsequent amantadine treatments produced enhancement of motility from corresponding control in all mouse strains with the BALB/C mice being the least sensitive. The locomotor activity was decreased from corresponding controls in all strains studied, except for the ICR mice, during an overnight drug-free period following the fourth amantadine treatment. Readministration of amantadine, after a drug-free overnight period, increased motility from respective saline control in all strains with exception of the BALB/C mice where suppression of motility occurred. Treatment with amantadine did not alter whole brain dopamine levels but decreased the amounts of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the BALB/C mice compared to saline control. Conversely, brain normetanephrine concentration was increased from saline control by amantadine in the BALB/C mice. The results suggest a strain-dependent effect of amantadine on motility and indicate a differential response to the acute and multiple dose regimens used. The BALB/C mouse was the most sensitive strain and could serve as the strain of choice for evaluating the side effects of amantadine. The biochemical results of brain biogenic amines of BALB/C mouse strain suggest a probable decrease of catecholamine turnover rate and/or metabolism by monoamine oxidase and a resulting increase in O-methylation of norepinephrine which may account for a behavioral depression caused by amantadine in the BALB/C mice.
The effect of amiloride on lithium-induced polydipsia and polyuria and on the lithium concentration in the plasma, brain, kidney, thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats, chronically treated with LiCl. Amiloride reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute (6 or 12 h) and a subacute (3 days) experiment. 6 h after the administration of amiloride, a reduction was observed in the lithium content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied. At 12 h, all the tissues showed a slight increase in lithium levels. After 3 days of combined treatment, a marked elevation in plasma and tissue lithium levels accompanied a reduction in water intake. In all the experiments, the attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium level. It is concluded that acute amiloride administration to lithium-treated patients suffering from polydipsia and polyuria might relieve these patients but prolonged amiloride supplementation would result in elevated lithium levels and might be hazardous.
The effect of aniracetam (Ro 13-5057, 1-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone) was studied on various forms of experimentally impaired cognitive functions (learning and memory) in rodents and produced the following effects: (1) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal hypercapnia immediately before the acquisition session; (2) partial (rats) or complete (mice) prevention of the scopolamine-induced short-term amnesia for a passive avoidance task; (3) complete protection against amnesia for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition; (4) prevention of the long-term retention- or retrieval-deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by chloramphenicol or cycloheximide administered immediately after acquisition; (5) reversal, when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test, of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive avoidance task induced by cycloheximide injected 2 days previously; (6) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant electroshock or hypercapnia applied immediately before retrieval testing (24 h after acquisition). These improvements or normalizations of impaired cognitive functions were seen at oral aniracetam doses of 10-100 mg/kg. Generally, the dose-response curves were bell-shaped. The mechanisms underlying the activity of aniracetam and its 'therapeutic window' are unknown. Piracetam, another pyrrolidinone derivative was used for comparison. It was active only in six of nine tests and had about one-tenth the potency of aniracetam. The results indicate that aniracetam improves cognitive functions which are impaired by different procedure and in different phases of the learning and memory process.
The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can "dissociate" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system.
The effect of clonidine, naphazoline and xylometazoline on analgesia induced by morphine, codeine, fentanyl and pentazocine, and on cataleptic effect of morphine, codine and fentanyl was studied in rats. The biochemical assays on the influence of four analgesics on the brain concentration and turnover of noradrenaline (NA) were also performed. It was found that three drugs stimulating central NA receptors failed to affect the analgesic ED50 of all antinociceptive agents and they enhanced catalepsy induced by morphine and fentanyl. Codeine catalepsy was increased by clonidine and decreased by naphazoline and xylometazoline. The brain concentration of NA was not changed by morphine and fentanyl, but one of the doses of codeine (45 mg/kg) slightly enhanced it. Pentazocine dose-dependently decreased the brain level of NA. The rate of NA turnover was not altered by analgesics except for the higher dose of fentanyl (0.2 mg/kg) following which the disappearance of NA from the brain was diminished. The results are discussed in the light of various and non-uniform data from the literature. It is suggested that in rats the brain NA plays a less important function than the other monoamines in the behavioural activity of potent analgesics.
The effect of deliberate hypotension on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients. Twenty-four patients were anaesthetized for middle-ear surgery with deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane (hypotensive group). Seventeen patients without hypotension served as a control group. The mean arterial pressure was 77 +/- 2 mmHg (10.3 +/- 0.3 kPa) before hypotension and 50 +/- 0 mmHg (6.7 +/- 0.0 kPa) during hypotension in the hypotensive group, and 86 +/- 2 mmHg (11.5 +/- 0.3 kPa) during anaesthesia in the control group. The following psychological tests were performed: four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (similarities, digit span, vocabulary and digit symbol), Trail-Making tests A and B, Zung tests (self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale) and two-part memory test battery with immediate and delayed recall. The tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value. The results indicate that hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia.
The effect of different anaesthetic agents in hearing loss following spinal anaesthesia.
The effect of exercise on the severity of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction was studied in male rats. Ninety-three rats were randomly divided into three groups. The exercise-isoproterenol (E-1) and exercise control (EC) groups exercised daily for thirty days on a treadmill at 1 mph, 2% grade while animals of the sedentary-isoproterenol (S-I) group remained sedentary. Eight animals were assigned to the sedentary control (SC) group which remained sedentary throughout the experimental period. Forty-eight hours after the final exercise period, S-I and E-I animals received a single subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (250 mg/kg body weight). Animals of the S-I group exhibited significantly (Pp less than 0.05) greater mortality from the effects of isoproterenol than animals of the E-I group. Serum CPK activity for E-I animals was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than for animals in the S-I and EC groups twenty hours following isoproterenol injection. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two isoproterenol treated groups for severity of the induced lesions, changes in heart weight, or heart weight to body weight ratios. The results indicated that exercise reduced the mortality associated with the effects of large dosages of isoproterenol but had little on the severity of the infarction.
The effect of exogenous estradiol treatment on the mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors in cultured human oviduct mucosal cells.
The effect of haloperidol in cocaine and amphetamine intoxication.
The effect of humoral modulators on the morphine-induced increase in locomotor activity of mice was studied. The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg of morphine-HC1 produced a marked increase in locomotor activity in mice. The morphine-induced hyperactivity was potentiated by scopolamine and attenuated by physostigmine. In contrast, both methscopolamine and neostigmine, which do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, had no effect on the hyperactivity produced by morphine. Pretreatment of mice with alpha-methyltyrosine (20 mg/kg i.p., one hour), an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, significantly decreased the activity-increasing effects of morphine. On the other hand, pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalamine (3 X 320 mg/kg i.p., 24 hr), a serotonin depletor, caused no significant change in the hyperactivity. The study suggests that the activity-increasing effects of morphine are mediated by the release of catecholamines from adrenergic neurons in the brain. And the results are consistent with the hypothesis that morphine acts by retarding the release of acetylcholine at some central cholinergic synapses. It is also suggested from collected evidence that the activity-increasing effects of morphine in mice are mediated by mechanisms different from those which mediate the activity-increasing effects of morphine in rats.
The effect of induced hypertension instituted after a 2-h delay following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on brain edema formation and histochemical injury was studied. Under isoflurane anesthesia, the MCA of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded. In the control group (n = 7), the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the hypertensive group (n = 7), the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after MCAO. Four hours after MCAO, the rats were killed and the brains harvested. The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by MCAO. Specific gravity (SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex (core and periphery of the ischemic territory). The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining. In the ischemic core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups. In the periphery of the ischemic territory, SG in the cortex was greater (less edema accumulation) in the hypertensive group (1.041 +/- 0.001 vs 1.039 +/- 0.001, P less than 0.05). The area of histochemical injury (as a percent of the cross-sectional area of the hemisphere) was less in the hypertensive group (33 +/- 3% vs 21 +/- 2%, P less than 0.05). The data indicate that phenylephrine-induced hypertension instituted 2 h after MCAO does not aggravate edema in the ischemic core, that it improves edema in the periphery of the ischemic territory, and that it reduces the area of histochemical neuronal dysfunction.
The effect of isoflurane-induced hypotension on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance, respectively. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and isoflurane. Hypotension was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the isoflurane inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg. GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during hypotension. Postoperatively, ERPF returned to preoperative values, whereas GFR was higher than preoperative values. Renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when hypotension was induced, allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow. We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during isoflurane-induced hypotension and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed.
The effect of long-term timolol treatment on heart size after myocardial infarction was evaluated by X-ray in a double-blind study including 241 patients (placebo 126, timolol 115). The follow-up period was 12 months. The timolol-treated patients showed a small but significant increase in heart size from baseline in contrast to a decrease in the placebo group. These differences may be caused by timolol-induced bradycardia and a compensatory increase in end-diastolic volume. The timolol-related increase in heart size was observed only in patients with normal and borderline heart size. In patients with cardiomegaly, the increase in heart size was similar in both groups. After re-infarction, heart size increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the timolol group.
The effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients who were receiving tacrolimus was evaluated between January 1992 and January 1996. Two groups of patients receiving tacrolimus were compared over a period of 1 year, one group comprising hypertensive patients who were receiving nifedipine, and the other comprising nonhypertensive patients not receiving nifedipine. The time from transplant to baseline was similar in all patients. Nifedipine significantly improved kidney function as indicated by a significant lowering of serum creatinine levels at 6 and 12 months. The observed positive impact of nifedipine on reducing the nephrotoxicity associated with tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients should be an important factor in selecting an agent to treat hypertension in this population.
The effect of nitroglycerin on heart rate and systolic blood pressure was compared in 5 normal subjects, 12 diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy, and 5 diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy. The magnitude and time course of the increase in heart rate and the decrease in systolic blood pressure after nitroglycerin were similar in the normal and diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy, whereas a lesser increase in heart rate and a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred in the diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy. It is therefore suggested that caution should be exercised when prescribing vasodilator drugs in diabetic patients, particularly those with autonomic neuropathy.
The effect of pupil dilation with tropicamide on vision and driving simulator performance.
The effect of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I on chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy in rats.
The effect of ritanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) on scopolamine (muscarinic cholinergic antagonist)-induced amnesia in Morris water maze (MWM) was investigated. Rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into CA1 region of the hippocampus. One week later, they received repeatedly vehicles (saline, DMSO, saline+DMSO), scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl saline/side; 30 min before training), ritanserin (2, 4 and 8 microg/0.5 microl DMSO/side; 20 min before training) and scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl; 30 min before ritanserin injection)+ritanserin (4 microg/0.5 microl DMSO) through cannulae each day. Animals were tested for four consecutive days (4 trial/day) in MWM during which the position of hidden platform was unchanged. In the fifth day, the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor, motivational and visual systems. The results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and traveled distances to find platform in scopolamine-treated group as compared to saline group. Ritanserin-treated rats (4 microg/0.5 microl/side) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to DMSO-treated group. However, scopolamine and ritanserin co-administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and traveled distances as compared to the scopolamine-treated rats. Our findings show that microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of the hippocampus improves the scopolamine-induced amnesia.
The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) enalapril was assessed in Munich-Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis. Rats were given a single dose of adriamycin and one month later divided into four groups matched for albuminuria, blood pressure, and plasma albumin concentration. Groups 1 and 3 remained untreated while groups 2 and 4 received enalapril. Groups 1 and 2 underwent micropuncture studies after 10 days. These short-term studies showed that enalapril reduced arterial blood pressure (101 +/- 2 vs. 124 +/- 3 mm Hg, group 2 vs. 1, P less than 0.05) and glomerular capillary pressure (54 +/- 1 vs. 61 +/- 2 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) without reducing albuminuria (617 +/- 50 vs. 570 +/- 47 mg/day) or GFR (1.03 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.11 ml/min). Groups 3 and 4 were studied at four and at six months to assess the effect of enalapril on progression of renal injury in adriamycin nephrosis. Chronic enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure without reducing albuminuria in group 4. Untreated group 3 rats exhibited a progressive reduction in GFR (0.35 +/- 0.08 ml/min at 4 months, 0.27 +/- 0.07 ml/min at 6 months). Enalapril treatment blunted but did not prevent reduction in GFR in group 4 (0.86 +/- 0.15 ml/min at 4 months, 0.69 +/- 0.13 ml/min at 6 months, both P less than 0.05 vs. group 3). Reduction in GFR was associated with the development of glomerular sclerosis in both treated and untreated rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The effect of treatment with gum Arabic on gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats: a preliminary study.
The effectiveness of administration of glycopyrrolate 5 and 10 micrograms kg-1 and atropine 10 and 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v. immediately before the induction of anaesthesia, to prevent arrhythmia and bradycardia following repeated doses of suxamethonium in children, was studied. A control group was included for comparison with the lower dose range of glycopyrrolate and atropine. A frequency of bradycardia of 50% was noted in the control group, but this was not significantly different from the frequency with the active drugs. Bradycardia (defined as a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beat min-1) was prevented when the larger dose of either active drug was used. It is recommended that either glycopyrrolate 10 micrograms kg-1 or atropine 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v. should immediately precede induction of anaesthesia, in children, if the repeated administration of suxamethonium is anticipated.
The effectiveness of haloperidol pretreatment in preventing the toxic effects of high doses of amphetamine and cocaine was studied in rats. In this model, toxic effects were induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of amphetamine 75 mg/kg (100% death rate) or cocaine 70 mg/kg (82% death rate). Haloperidol failed to prevent amphetamine-induced seizures, but did lower the mortality rate at most doses tested. Haloperidol decreased the incidence of cocaine-induced seizures at the two highest doses, but the lowering of the mortality rate did not reach statistical significance at any dose. These data suggest a protective role for the central dopamine blocker haloperidol against death from high-dose amphetamine exposure without reducing the incidence of seizures. In contrast, haloperidol demonstrated an ability to reduce cocaine-induced seizures without significantly reducing mortality.
The effects of N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor and L-arginine, a NO precursor, were investigated on lidocaine-induced convulsions. In the first experiment, four groups of mice received physiological saline (0.9%), L-arginine (300 mg/kg, i.p.), L-NAME (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (2 mg/kg), respectively. Thirty minutes after these injections, all mice received lidocaine (50 mg/kg, i.p.). In the second experiment, four groups of mice received similar treatment in the first experiment, and 30 min after these injections, all mice received a higher dose of lidocaine (80 mg/kg). L-NAME (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (2 mg/kg) significantly decreased the incidence of lidocaine (50 mg/kg)-induced convulsions. In contrast, the L-arginine treatment increased the incidence of lidocaine (80 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced convulsions significantly. These results may suggest that NO is a proconvulsant mediator in lidocaine-induced convulsions.
The effects of NIK-247 on cholinesterase, scopolamine-induced amnesia and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well-known cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine and E-2020. NIK-247, tacrine and E-2020 all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in human red blood cells (IC50s = 1.0 x 10(-6), 2.9 x 10(-7) and 3.7 x 10(-8) M, respectively). In addition, NIK-247 and tacrine, but not E-2020, strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase (BuChE) in human serum. All three drugs produced mixed inhibition of AChE activity. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of NIK-247 on AChE was reversible. All compounds at 0.1-1 mg/kg p.o. significantly improved the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) in rats performing a passive avoidance task. The three compounds at 1 and 3 mg/kg p.o. did not significantly decrease spontaneous movement by rats. These findings suggest that NIK-247 at a low dose (0.1-1 mg/kg p.o.) improves scopolamine-induced amnesia but does not affect spontaneous movement. The findings suggest that NIK-247 may be a useful drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
The effects of PG-9 (3alpha-tropyl 2-(p-bromophenyl)propionate), the acetylcholine releaser, on memory processes and nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis were evaluated. In the mouse passive-avoidance test, PG-9 (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 20 min before the training session, prevented amnesia induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug scopolamine and the M1-selective antagonist S-(-)-ET-126. In the same experimental conditions, PG-9 (5-20 microg per mouse, i.c.v.) was also able to prevent antimuscarine-induced amnesia, demonstrating a central localization of the activity. At the highest effective doses, PG-9 did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the Irwin test, and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity, as revealed by the hole-board test. PG-9 was also able to increase the amount of NGF secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal NGF contents obtained by PG-9 were 17.6-fold of the control value. During culture, no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of PG-9. The current work indicates the ability of PG-9 to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of NGF synthesis in astroglial cells. Therefore, PG-9 could represent a potential useful drug able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes.
The effects of REM sleep deprivation (REMD) on apomorphine-induced aggressiveness and quipazine-induced head twitches in rats were determined. Forty-eight hr of REMD increased apomorphine-induced aggressiveness, and reduced (immediately after completing of REMD) or increased (96 hr after completing of REMD) quipazine-induced head twitches. Results are discussed in terms of similarity to pharmacological effects of other antidepressive treatments.
The effects of a 6-hour infusion with haloperidol on serum prolactin and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels was studied in a group of male subjects. Five hours after starting the infusions, a study of the pituitary responses to LH-releasing hormone (LH-RH) was carried out. Control patients received infusions of 0.9% NaCl solution. During the course of haloperidol infusions, significant hyperprolactinemia was found, together with an abolished pituitary response to LH-RH, as compared with responses of control subjects.
The effects of a new inhaled antimuscarinic drug, oxitropium bromide, and of a slow-release theophylline preparation upon nocturnal asthma were compared in a placebo-controlled double-blind study. Two samples were studied: 12 patients received oxitropium at 600 micrograms (6 subjects) or at 400 micrograms t.i.d. (6 subjects) whereas 11 received theophylline at 300 mg b.i.d. Morning dipping, assessed by the fall in peak flow overnight, was significantly reduced in the periods when either active drug was taken, whereas no difference was noticed during the placebo administration. No significant difference was noticed between results obtained with either active drug, as well as with either dosage of oxitropium. No subject reported side effects of oxitropium, as compared to three subjects reporting nausea, vomiting and tremors after theophylline. Oxitropium proves to be a valuable alternative to theophylline in nocturnal asthma, since it is equally potent, safer and does not require the titration of dosage.
The effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) treatment on local anesthetic-kindled seizures and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of CBZ administration. Chronic oral CBZ inhibited the development of both lidocaine- and cocaine-induced seizures, but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic seizures. Chronic CBZ also decreased the incidence of seizure-related mortality in the cocaine-injected rats. Acute CBZ over a range of doses (15-50 mg/kg) had no effect on completed lidocaine-kindled or acute cocaine-induced seizures. Repeated i.p. injection of CBZ (15 mg/kg) also was without effect on the development of lidocaine- or cocaine-kindled seizures. The differential effects of CBZ depending upon stage of seizure development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic-kindled seizures. The effectiveness of chronic but not repeated, intermittent injections of CBZ suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens. The possible utility of chronic CBZ in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human cocaine users is suggested by these data, but remains to be directly evaluated.
The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt (QS/QT) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during sodium nitroprusside infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40-50 per cent. Before nitroprusside infusion, 5 cm H2O CPAP significantly, P less than .05, decreased arterial blood pressure, but did not significantly alter heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, or QS/QT. Ten cm H2O CPAP before nitroprusside infusion produced a further decrease in arterial blood pressure and significantly increased heart rate and decreased cardiac output and QS/QT. Nitroprusside caused significant decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate, but did not change cardiac output or QS/QT. Five cm H2O CPAP during nitroprusside did not further alter any of the above-mentioned variables. However, 10 cm H2O CPAP decreased arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and QS/QT. These data indicate that nitroprusside infusion rates that decrease mean arterial blood pressure by 40-50 per cent do not change cardiac output or QS/QT. During nitroprusside infusion low levels of CPAP do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics, but high levels of CPAP (10 cm H2O), while decreasing QS/QT, produce marked decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output.
The effects of diazepam on cardiovascular function were assessed in conscious rats. Intravenous administration of diazepam (1-30 mg kg-1) produced a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate. Also, reflex bradycardia was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of adrenaline (1.25-2.5 micrograms kg-1). Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with diazepam, although causing no change in the adrenaline-induced pressor effect, did enhance the adrenaline-induced reflex bradycardia. However, the diazepam enhancement of adrenaline-induced reflex bradycardia was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of picrotoxin (an agent blocks chloride channels by binding to sites associated with the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride channel macromolecular complex). The data indicate that diazepam acts through the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex bradycardia mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in response to an acute increase in arterial pressure.
The effects of digitalis glycosides on myocardial oxygen supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease, but have not been measured previously in man. We assessed the effects of ouabain (0.015 mg/kg body weight) on hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart failure. Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations, we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that ouabain administration was omitted. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell in each patient given ouabain, even though they were initially elevated in only two patients. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 11.5+/-1.4 (mean+/-SE) to 5.6+/-0.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell from 100+/-17 to 82+/-12 ml/m2 (P less than 0.01) 1 h after ouabain infusion was completed. The maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1.68+/-0.11 ml/s to 2.18+/-0.21 muscle-lengths/s (P less than 0.05) and is consistent with an increase in contractility. No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients. No significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in the control patients. We conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end-diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when it is initially normal. Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension, and, therefore, of myocardial oxygen consumption, it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen consumption. Nevertheless, compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism.
The effects of dizocilpine (MK-801), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, were studied on dopamine-related behaviors induced by reserpine treatments. This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for Parkinson's disease, or tardive dyskinesia, and its response after glutamatergic blockage. Reserpine (1 mg/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia. Reserpine also produced tremor and catalepsy, which are signs suggestive of Parkinson's disease. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by reserpine. However, MK-801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in reserpine-treated mice. Reserpine (1 mg/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection (0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice. On the other hand, reserpine induced increases in tremor and catalepsy compared to control mice. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) administration attenuated the catalepsy and tremor induced by reserpine. Pretreatment with reserpine (1 mg/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in tremor and catalepsy, whereas MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of reserpine. These results show that reserpine produces different and abnormal movements, which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as parkinsonian-like and tardive dsykinesia signs. The glutamatergic blockage produced by NMDA can restore these signs, such as vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions, catalepsy and tremor according to the employed model.
The effects of dystrophin gene mutations on the ERG in mice and humans.
The effects of exercise on the severity of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction were studied in female albino rats of 20,40,60 and 80 weeks of age. The rats were trained to swim for a specific duration and for a particular period. The occurrence of infarcts were confirmed by histological methods. Elevations in the serum GOT and GPT were maximum in the sedentary-isoproterenols and minimum in the exercise-controls. These changes in the serum transaminases were associated with corresponding depletions in the cardiac GOT and GPT. However, age was seen to interfere with the responses exhibited by the young and old rats. Studies dealing with myocardial infarction are more informative when dealt with age.
The effects of helodermin, a basic 35-amino acid peptide isolated from the venom of a lizard salivary gland, on arterial blood pressure and heart rate were examined in the rat, focusing on the possibility that activation of ATP sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels is involved in the responses. The results were also compared with those of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Helodermin produced hypotension in a dose-dependent manner with approximately similar potency and duration to VIP. Hypotension induced by both peptides was significantly attenuated by glibenclamide, which abolished a levcromakalim-produced decrease in arterial blood pressure. Oxyhemoglobin did not affect helodermin-induced hypotension, whereas it shortened the duration of acetylcholine (ACh)-produced hypotension. These findings suggest that helodermin-produced hypotension is partly attributable to the activation of glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channels (K(ATP) channels), which presumably exist on arterial smooth muscle cells. EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor)/nitric oxide does not seem to play an important role in the peptide-produced hypotension.
The effects of i.v. bolus administration of cromakalim (1-10 micrograms/kg) and pinacidil (3-100 micrograms/kg) on large (circumflex artery) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of nitroglycerin (0.03-10 micrograms/kg). Nitroglycerin, up to 0.3 micrograms/kg, selectively increased circumflex artery diameter (CxAD) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter. In contrast, cromakalim and pinacidil at all doses and nitroglycerin at doses higher than 0.3 micrograms/kg simultaneously and dose-dependently increased CxAD, coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure. Cromakalim was approximately 8- to 9.5-fold more potent than pinacidil in increasing CxAD. Vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and hypotension induced by cromakalim and pinacidil were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug-induced tachycardia was abolished. When circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant, the increases in CxAD induced by cromakalim (10 micrograms/kg), pinacidil (30 micrograms/kg) and nitroglycerin (10 micrograms/kg) were reduced by 68 +/- 7, 54 +/- 9 and 1 +/- 1%, respectively. Thus, whereas nitroglycerin preferentially and flow-independently dilates large coronary arteries, cromakalim and pinacidil dilate both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors-mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand. Finally, two mechanisms at least, direct vasodilation and flow dependency, are involved in the cromakalim- and pinacidil-induced increase in CxAD.
The effects of i.v.c. injection of human and salmon calcitonin on biochemical and behavioral parameters related to the extrapyramidal motor system, were investigated in male rats. Calcitonin injection resulted in a potentiation of haloperidol-induced catalepsy and a partial prevention of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity. Moreover calcitonin induced a significant decrease in nigral GAD activity but no change in striatal DA and DOPAC concentration or GAD activity. The results are discussed in view of a primary action of calcitonin on the striatonigral GABAergic pathway mediating the DA-related behavioral messages of striatal origin.
The effects of intracoronary administration of methylergonovine were studied in 21 patients with variant angina and 22 patients with atypical chest pain and in others without angina pectoris (control group). Methylergonovine was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms/min up to 50 micrograms. In all patients with variant angina, coronary spasm was provoked at a mean dose of 28 +/- 13 micrograms (mean +/- SD). In the control group neither ischemic ST change nor localized spasm occurred. The basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery. The percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery. These results suggest that spasm provocation tests, which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of methylergonovine, have a high sensitivity in variant angina and the vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries.
The effects of intrathecal administration of prostaglandins on pain responses in conscious mice were evaluated by using hot plate and acetic acid writhing tests. Prostaglandin D2 (0.5-3 ng/mouse) had a hyperalgesic action on the response to a hot plate during a 3-60 min period after injection. Prostaglandin E2 showed a hyperalgesic effect at doses of 1 pg to 10 ng/mouse, but the effect lasted shorter (3-30 min) than that of prostaglandin D2. Similar results were obtained by acetic acid writhing tests. The hyperalgesic effect of prostaglandin D2 was blocked by simultaneous injection of a substance P antagonist (greater than or equal to 100 ng) but not by AH6809, a prostanoid EP1-receptor antagonist. Conversely, prostaglandin E2-induced hyperalgesia was blocked by AH6809 (greater than or equal to 500 ng) but not by the substance P antagonist. Prostaglandin F2 alpha had little effect on pain responses. These results demonstrate that both prostaglandin D2 and prostaglandin E2 exert hyperalgesia in the spinal cord, but in different ways.
The effects of microinjection of clonidine (1-10 micrograms in 1 microliter) into a region adjacent to the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata on cardiovascular function were assessed in urethane-anesthetized rats. Intramedullary administration of clonidine, but not saline vehicle, caused a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate. The clonidine-induced hypotension was antagonized by prior spinal transection, but not bilateral vagotomy. On the other hand, the clonidine-induced bradycardia was antagonized by prior bilateral vagotomy, but not spinal transection. Furthermore, selective destruction of the spinal 5-HT nerves, produced by bilateral spinal injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, reduced the magnitude of the vasodepressor or the bradycardiac responses to clonidine microinjected into the area near the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata in rats. The data indicate that a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway is involved in development of clonidine-induced hypotension and bradycardia. The induced hypotension is brought about by a decrease in sympathetic efferent activity, whereas the induced bradycardia was due to an increase in vagal efferent activity.
The effects of oral administration of caffeine (10 mg/kg) on behavioral ratings, somatic symptoms, blood pressure and plasma levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol (MHPG) and cortisol were determined in 17 healthy subjects and 21 patients meeting DSM-III criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder. Caffeine produced significantly greater increases in subject-rated anxiety, nervousness, fear, nausea, palpitations, restlessness, and tremors in the patients compared with healthy subjects. In the patients, but not the healthy subjects, these symptoms were significantly correlated with plasma caffeine levels. Seventy-one percent of the patients reported that the behavioral effects of caffeine were similar to those experienced during panic attacks. Caffeine did not alter plasma MHPG levels in either the healthy subjects or patients. Caffeine increased plasma cortisol levels equally in the patient and healthy groups. Because caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist, these results suggest that some panic disorder patients may have abnormalities in neuronal systems involving adenosine. Patients with anxiety disorders may benefit by avoiding caffeine-containing foods and beverages.
The effects of oral doses of diazepam (single dose of 10 mg and a median dose of 30 mg/day for 2 weeks) and propranolol (single dose of 80 mg and a median dose of 240 mg/day for 2 weeks) on psychological performance of patients with panic disorders and agoraphobia were investigated in a double-blind, randomized and crossover design. Both drugs impaired immediate free recall but the decrease was greater for diazepam than propranolol. Delayed free recall was also impaired but the two drugs did not differ. Patients tapped faster after propranolol than diazepam and they were more sedated after diazepam than propranolol. After 2 weeks of treatment, patients tested 5-8 h after the last dose of medication did not show any decrement of performance. These results are similar to those previously found in healthy subjects. Accumulation of drugs was not reflected in prolonged behavioral impairment.
The effects of progesterone treatment on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in beating rat heart myocyte cultures and on anesthetized rats were determined. After determining the bupivacaine AD50 (the concentration of bupivacaine that caused 50% of all beating rat heart myocyte cultures to become arrhythmic), we determined the effect of 1-hour progesterone HCl exposure on myocyte contractile rhythm. Each concentration of progesterone (6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 micrograms/ml) caused a significant and concentration-dependent reduction in the AD50 for bupivacaine. Estradiol treatment also increased the arrhythmogenicity of bupivacaine in myocyte cultures, but was only one fourth as potent as progesterone. Neither progesterone nor estradiol effects on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity were potentiated by epinephrine. Chronic progesterone pretreatment (5 mg/kg/day for 21 days) caused a significant increase in bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in intact pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. There was a significant decrease in the time to onset of arrhythmia as compared with control nonprogesterone-treated rats (6.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 30.8 +/- 2.5 min, mean +/- SE). The results of this study indicate that progesterone can potentiate bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity both in vivo and in vitro. Potentiation of bupivacaine arrhythmia in myocyte cultures suggests that this effect is at least partly mediated at the myocyte level.
The effects of quinine and 4-aminopyridine on conditioned place preference and changes in motor activity induced by morphine in rats.
The effects of serial treatment with doxorubicin on dynamic myocardial scintigraphy with [omega-I-131]heptadecanoic acid (I-131 HA), and on global left-ventricular function determined echocardiographically, were studied in a group of nine mongrel dogs. Total extractable myocardial lipid was compared postmortem between a group of control dogs and doxorubicin-treated dogs. A significant and then progressive fall in global LV function was observed at a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 4 mg/kg. A significant increase in the myocardial t1/2 of the I-131 HA was observed only at a higher cumulative dose, 10 mg/kg. No significant alteration in total extractable myocardial lipids was observed between control dogs and those treated with doxorubicin. Our findings suggest that the changes leading to an alteration of myocardial dynamic imaging with I-131 HA are not the initiating factor in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.

The effects of the adjunctive bupropion on male sexual dysfunction induced by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor: a double-blind placebo-controlled and randomized study.
The effects of varying the extracellular concentrations of Na and Ca ([Na]o and [Ca]o) on both, the spontaneous beating and the negative chronotropic action of verapamil, were studied in the isolated rat atria. Basal frequency (BF) evaluated by surface electrogram was 223 +/- 4 beats/min. in control Krebs-Ringer containing 137 mM Na and 1.35 mM Ca (N). It decreased by 16 +/- 3% by lowering [Na]o to 78 mM (LNa), 23 +/- 2% by lowering simultaneously [Na]o to 78 mM and [Ca]o to 0.675 mM (LNa+LCa) and 31 +/- 5% by lowering [Na]o to 78 mM plus increasing [Ca]o to 3.6 mM (LNa+HCa). At normal [Na]o, decrease (0.675 mM) or increase (3.6 mM) of [Ca]o did not modify BF; a reduction of ten times (0.135 mM of normal [Ca]o was effective to reduce BF by 40 +/- 13%. All negative chronotropic effects were BF-dependent. Dose-dependent bradycardia induced by verapamil was potentiated by LNa, LCa, and HCa. Independent but not additive effects of Na and Ca are shown by decreases in the values of [verapamil]o needed to reduce BF by 30% (IC30) with the following order of inhibitory potency: LNa > LCa > HCa > N, resulting LNa+HCa similar to LNa. The [verapamil]o that arrested atrial beating (AC) was also potentiated with the order LNa = LNa+LCa = LNa+HCa = LCa > HCa = N. The results indicate that rat atrial spontaneous beating is more dependent on [Na]o than on [Ca]o in a range of +/- 50% of their normal concentration. Also the enhancement of verapamil effects on atrial beating was more pronounced at LNa than at LCa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The effects on renal function on two different immunosuppressive protocols were evaluated retrospectively in two subsequent groups of heart transplant recipients. In group I, cyclosporine was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17.5 mg/kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a whole blood level about 1000 ng/ml. In group II, cyclosporine was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by azathioprine, which was used for the first postoperative week. Group II showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic nephrotoxicity secondary to long-term therapy with cyclosporine. Despite this improvement in late renal function, group II still shows a slow rise in serum creatinine. We think that even these lower dosages of cyclosporine can cause chronic nephrotoxicity and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect.
The efficacy and safety of a new benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, were assessed in a double-blind multicenter study. Flumazenil (mean dose, 0.76 mg) or placebo (mean dose, 8.9 ml) was administered intravenously to 130 and 67 patients, respectively, who had been given diazepam in conjunction with an opioid (fentanyl, meperidine, or morphine) for the induction and maintenance of intravenous conscious sedation for diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedures. The group assessable for efficacy comprised 122 patients treated with flumazenil and 64 patients given placebo. After 5 minutes, 80/115 (70%) flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 21/63 (33%) placebo-treated patients, were completely awake and alert, as indicated by a score of 5 on the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale. Ninety-five percent of patients in each group who attained a score of 5 at the 5-minute assessment showed no loss of alertness throughout the 180-minute assessment period. Flumazenil-treated patients also performed significantly better on the Finger-to-Nose Test and the recall of pictures shown at the 5-minute assessment. Flumazenil was well tolerated, with no serious adverse effects reported. Thirty-nine (30%) of flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 17 (25%) of placebo-treated patients had one or more drug-related adverse experiences. The most common adverse effects were nausea and vomiting in the flumazenil group and nausea and injection-site pain in the placebo group. Flumazenil was found to promptly reverse sedation induced by diazepam in the presence of opioids.
The efficacy of denopamine, an orally active beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, in improving cardiac failure was assessed in dog heart-lung preparations. Cardiac functions depressed by pentobarbital (118 +/- 28 mg; mean value +/- SD) such that cardiac output and maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt max) had been reduced by about 35% and 26% of the respective controls were improved by denopamine (10-300 micrograms) in a dose-dependent manner. With 100 micrograms denopamine, almost complete restoration of cardiac performance was attained, associated with a slight increase in heart rate. No arrhythmias were induced by these doses of denopamine. The results warrant clinical trials of denopamine in the treatment of cardiac failure.
The electrocardiograms (ECG) of 99 cocaine-abusing patients were compared with the ECGs of 50 schizophrenic controls. Eleven of the cocaine abusers and none of the controls had ECG evidence of significant myocardial injury defined as myocardial infarction, ischemia, and bundle branch block.
The enhancement of aminonucleoside nephrosis by the co-administration of protamine.
The epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with newer oral contraceptives (OC) did not distinguish between patterns of OC use, namely first-time users, repeaters and switchers. Data from a Transnational case-control study were used to assess the risk of VTE for the latter patterns of use, while accounting for duration of use. Over the period 1993-1996, 551 cases of VTE were identified in Germany and the UK along with 2066 controls. Totals of 128 cases and 650 controls were analysed for repeat use and 135 cases and 622 controls for switching patterns. The adjusted rate ratio of VTE for repeat users of third generation OC was 0.6 (95% CI:0.3-1.2) relative to repeat users of second generation pills, whereas it was 1.3 (95% CI:0.7-2.4) for switchers from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills. We conclude that second and third generation agents are associated with equivalent risks of VTE when the same agent is used repeatedly after interruption periods or when users are switched between the two generations of pills. These analyses suggest that the higher risk observed for the newer OC in other studies may be the result of inadequate comparisons of pill users with different patterns of pill use.
The epidemiology of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity is not fully understood. Experimental studies in healthy human volunteers indicate aminoglycosides cause proximal tubular damage in most patients, but rarely, if ever, cause glomerular or tubular dysfunction. Clinical trials of aminoglycosides in seriously ill patients indicate that the relative risk for developing acute renal failure during therapy ranges from 8 to 10 and that the attributable risk is 70% to 80%. Further analysis of these data suggests that the duration of therapy, plasma aminoglycoside levels, liver disease, advanced age, high initial estimated creatinine clearance and, possibly, female gender all increase the risk for nephrotoxicity. Other causes of acute renal failure, such as shock, appear to have an additive effect. Predictive models have been developed from these analyses that should be useful for identifying patients at high risk. These models may also be useful in developing insights into the pathophysiology of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity.
The epidemiology of the acute flank pain syndrome from suprofen.
The estimated incidence of angioedema during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment is between 1 and 7 per thousand patients. This potentially serious adverse effect is often preceded by minor manifestations that may serve as a warning.
The etiology of pyeloureteritis cystica has long been attributed to chronic infection and inflammation. A case is presented that is unique in that the acute onset and the rapid resolution of pyeloureteral filling defects in this patient were documented by radiography. There is no evidence of antecedent or concurrent infection in this patient. The disease occurred subsequent to the initiation of heparin therapy for suspected pelvic thrombophlebitis and cleared rapidly subsequent to its discontinuation. The rate of resolution of the radiographic findings may be helpful in distinguishing between true pyeloureteritis cystica and submucosal hemorrhage.
The eukaryotic UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylases. Gene cloning, protein expression, and catalytic mechanism.
The eukaryotic ribonuclease for mitochondrial RNA processing (RNase MRP) is mainly located in the nucleoli and belongs to the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) particles. RNase MRP is involved in the processing of pre-rRNA and the generation of RNA primers for mitochondrial DNA replication. A closely related snoRNP, which shares protein subunits with RNase MRP and contains a structurally related RNA subunit, is the pre-tRNA processing factor RNase P. Up to now, 10 protein subunits of these complexes have been described, designated hPop1, hPop4, hPop5, Rpp14, Rpp20, Rpp21, Rpp25, Rpp30, Rpp38 and Rpp40. To get more insight into the assembly of the human RNase MRP complex we studied protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions by means of GST pull-down experiments. A total of 19 direct protein-protein and six direct protein-RNA interactions were observed. The analysis of mutant RNase MRP RNAs showed that distinct regions are involved in the direct interaction with protein subunits. The results provide insight into the way the protein and RNA subunits assemble into a ribonucleoprotein particle. Based upon these data a new model for the architecture of the human RNase MRP complex was generated.
The event triggering malignant proliferation in 70% of retinoblastoma tumours is loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 13q14, whereby the normal retinoblastoma gene (RB1) allele is lost and an already mutated RB1 allele remains in the tumour. The first allele suffers a mutational event--deletion, duplication or point mutation (manuscript in preparation) --either in the germ line (all bilateral patients) or in a somatic retinal cell (most unilateral patients). Most bilateral patients have no family history of retinoblastoma and are presumed to have new germline mutations which arose in the egg, sperm or early embryo. We have determined the parental origin of the retained allele in nine retinoblastoma tumours from eight unrelated non-familial cases by using RB1-linked genetic markers. Six tumours retained the paternal allele and three retained the maternal allele. Of the three unilateral tumours, only one retained the paternal RB1 allele. Thus, there is no evidence that the paternal RB1 allele is preferentially retained in retinoblastoma, as has been suggested to be the case in osteosarcoma. By contrast, tumours from four of the five bilateral patients retained the paternal RB1 allele. This suggests either that new germline RB1 mutations arise more frequently during spermatogenesis than during oogenesis, or that imprinting in the early embryo affects chromosomal susceptibility to mutation..
The exon 13 duplication in the BRCA1 gene is a founder mutation present in geographically diverse populations. The BRCA1 Exon 13 Duplication Screening Group.
The expression cloning of a cDNA for globotriaosylceramide (Gb3)/CD77 synthase (alpha1,4-galactosyltransferase) was achieved using an anti-Gb3 antibody and mouse L cells as a recipient cell line for the transfection. The isolated cDNA clone designated pVTR1 predicted a type II membrane protein with 19 amino acids of cytoplasmic domain, 26 amino acids of transmembrane region, and a catalytic domain with 308 amino acids. Introduction of the cDNA clone into L cells resulted in the neosynthesis of Gb3/CD77, and the extracts of the transfectant cells showed alpha1, 4-galactosyltransferase activity only on lactosylceramide and galactosylceramide. In Northern blotting, a 2.3-kilobase mRNA was strongly expressed in heart, kidney, spleen, and placenta and weakly in colon, small intestine, and brain. Transfection of the cDNA into L cells resulted in the constitution of sensitivity to the apoptosis with Shiga-like toxins (verotoxins). Since Gb3/CD77 synthase initiates the synthesis of globo series glycolipids, the isolation of this cDNA will make possible further investigations into the function of its important series of glycolipids.
The expression level of the neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 (SLC12A5) is a major determinant of whether neurons will respond to GABA with a depolarizing, excitatory response or a hyperpolarizing, inhibitory response. In view of the potential role in human neuronal excitability we have characterized the hKCC2 cDNA and gene. The 5.9 kb hKCC2 transcript is specific to brain, and is induced during in vitro differentiation of NT2 teratocarcinoma cells into neuronal NT2-N cells. The 24-exon SLC12A5 gene is on human chromosome 20q13, and contains a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat within intron 1 near a potential binding site for neuron-restrictive silencing factor. Expression of hKCC2 cRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes results in significant Cl(-)-dependent (86)Rb(+) uptake under isotonic conditions; cell swelling under hypotonic conditions causes a 20-fold activation, which is blocked by the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin-A. In contrast, oocytes expressing mouse KCC4 do not mediate isotonic K-Cl cotransport but express much higher absolute transport activity than KCC2 oocytes under hypotonic conditions. Initial and steady state kinetics of hKCC2-injected oocytes were performed in both isotonic and hypotonic conditions, revealing K(m)s for K(+) and Cl(-) of 9.3+/-1.8 mM and 6.8+/-0.9 mM, respectively; both affinities are significantly higher than KCC1 and KCC4. The K(m) for Cl(-) is close to the intracellular Cl(-) activity of mature neurons, as befits a neuronal efflux mechanism. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
The expression of arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) was investigated in rats with lithium (Li)-induced polyuria, using in situ hybridization histochemistry and radioimmunoassay. The male Wistar rats consuming a diet that contained LiCl (60 mmol/kg) for 4 weeks developed marked polyuria. The Li-treated rats produced a large volume of hypotonic urine with low ionic concentrations. Plasma sodium concentrations were found to be slightly increased in the Li-treated rats compared with those in controls. Plasma concentration of AVP and transcripts of AVP gene in the PVN and SON were significantly increased in the Li-treated rats compared with controls. These results suggest that dehydration and/or the activation of visceral afferent inputs may contribute to the elevation of plasma AVP and the upregulation of AVP gene expression in the PVN and the SON of the Li-induced diabetes insipidus rat.
The feasibility of using labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent, as a hypotensive agent in combination with inhalation anaesthetics (halothane, enflurane or isoflurane) was studied in 23 adult patients undergoing middle-ear surgery. The mean arterial pressure was decreased from 86 +/- 5 (s.e. mean) mmHg to 52 +/- 1 mmHg (11.5 +/- 0.7 to 6.9 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 98 +/- 10 min in the halothane (H) group, from 79 +/- 5 to 53 +/- 1 mmHg (10.5 +/- 0.7 to 7.1 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 129 +/- 11 min in the enflurane (E) group, and from 80 +/- 4 to 49 +/- 1 mmHg (10.7 +/- 0.5 to 6.5 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 135 +/- 15 min in the isoflurane (I) group. The mean H concentration during hypotension in the inspiratory gas was 0.7 +/- 0.1 vol%, the mean E concentration 1.6 +/- 0.2 vol%, and the mean I concentration 1.0 +/- 0.1 vol%. In addition, the patients received fentanyl and d-tubocurarine. The initial dose of labetalol for lowering blood pressure was similar, 0.52-0.59 mg/kg, in all the groups. During hypotension, the heart rate was stable without tachy- or bradycardia. The operating conditions regarding bleeding were estimated in a double-blind manner, and did not differ significantly between the groups. During hypotension, the serum creatinine concentration rose significantly in all groups from the values before hypotension and returned postoperatively to the initial level in the other groups, except the isoflurane group. After hypotension there was no rebound phenomenon in either blood pressure or heart rate. These results indicate that labetalol induces easily adjustable hypotension without compensatory tachycardia and rebound hypertension.
The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play important roles in morphogenesis, angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and carcinogenesis. Human FGF-20 has been cloned and characterized in this study. FGF-20 encodes a 211-amino-acid polypeptide with the FGF-core domain. A strong hydrophobic region was found in the FGF-core domain of FGF-20; however, no typical N-terminal signal sequence was found in FGF-20, just as in FGF-9 and FGF-16. Total amino acid identities are as follows: FGF-20 vs FGF-9, 71.6%; FGF-20 vs FGF-16, 66.2%; FGF-9 vs FGF-16, 72.4%. Phylogenic analysis indicated that FGF-20, FGF-9, and FGF-16 constitute a subfamily among the FGF family. FGF-20 mRNA of 2.4 kb in size was detected in colon cancer cell line SW480 by Northern blot analysis. Lower levels of FGF-20 mRNA were detected in human fetal tissues and primary cancers by cDNA-PCR. The nucleotide sequence of FGF-20 cDNA is split into three parts in the human genome sequence of the chromosome 8p21.3-p22 region (Accession No. AB020858). These results indicate that the FGF-20 gene, located on human chromosome 8p21.3-p22, consists of three exons. Compared with the nucleotide sequence of FGF-20 cDNA determined in this study, one nucleotide deletion and one nucleotide substitution in the putative coding region were identified in human genome sequence AB020858.

The first known human kindred with hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement (C5) was documented in the accompanying report. This study examines several biological properties of C5-deficient (C5D) human serum, particularly sera obtained from two C5D homozygotes. The proband, who has inactive systemic lupus erythematosus is completely lacking C5, while her healthy half-sister has 1-2% of normal levels. Both sera were severely impaired in their ability to generate chemotactic activity for normal human neutrophils upon incubation with aggregated human gamma-globulin or Escherichia coli endotoxin. This function was fully restored in the siblings serum, and substantially improved in the probands serum, by addition of highly purified human C5 to normal serum concentrations. Sera from eight family members who were apparently heterozygous for C5 deficiency gave normal chemotactic scores. The ability of C5D serum to opsonize Saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers yeast) or Candida albicans for ingestion by normal neutrophils was completely normal. In addition, C5D serum was capable of promoting normal phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus. The probands serum was incapable of mediating lysis of erythrocytes from a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in both the sucrose hemolysia and acid hemolysis tests, and also lacked bactericidal activity against sensitized or unsensitized Salmonella typhi. The siblings serum, containing only 1-2% of normal C5, effectively lysed S. typhi, but only at eightfold lower serum dilutions as compared to normals. These findings underscore the critical role of C5 in the generation of chemotactic activity and in cytolytic reactions, as opposed to a nonobligatory or minimal role in opsonization, at least for the organisms under study..
The first predictive testing for Huntington disease (HD) was based on analysis of linked polymorphic DNA markers to estimate the likelihood of inheriting the mutation for HD. Limits to accuracy included recombination between the DNA markers and the mutation, pedigree structure, and whether DNA samples were available from family members. With direct tests for the HD mutation, we have assessed the accuracy of results obtained by linkage approaches when requested to do so by the test individuals. For six such individuals, there was significant disparity between the tests. Three went from a decreased risk to an increased risk, while in another three the risk was decreased. Knowledge of the potential reasons for these changes in results and impact of these risk reversals on both patients and the counseling team can assist in the development of strategies for the prevention and, where necessary, management of a risk reversal in any predictive testing program..
The first recognized human kindred with hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement (C5) is described. The proband, a 20-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus since age 11, lacked serum hemolytic complement activity, even during remission. C5 was undetectable in her serum by both immunodiffusion and hemolytic assays. Other complement components were normal during remission of lupus, but C1, C4, C2, and C3 levels fell during exacerbations. A younger half-sister, who had no underlying disease, was also found to lack immunochemically detectable C5. By hemolytic assay, she exhibited 1-2% of the normal serum C5 level and normal concentrations of other complement components. C5 levels of other family members were either normal or approximately half-normal, consistent with autosomal codominant inheritance of the gene determining C5 deficiency. Normal hemolytic titers were restored to both homozygous C5-deficient (C5D) sera by addition of highly purified human C5. In specific C5 titrations, however, it was noted that when limited amounts of C5 were assayed in the presence of low dilutions of either C5D serum, curving rather than linear dose-response plots were consistently obtained, suggesting some inhibitory effect. Further studies suggested that low dilutions of C5D serum contain a factor (or factors) interfering at some step in the hemolytic assay of C5, rather than a true C5 inhibitor or inactivator. Of clinical interest are (a) the documentation of membranous glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, and arthritis in an individual lacking C5 (and its biologic functions), and (b) a remarkable propensity to bacterial infections in the proband, even during periods of low-dose or alternate-day corticosteroid therapy. Other observations indicate that the C5D state is compatible with normal coagulation function and the capacity to mount a neutrophilic leukocytosis during pyogenic infection..
The first step in the splicing of an intron from nuclear precursors of mRNA results in the formation of a lariat structure. A distinct intronic nucleotide sequence, known as the branchpoint region, plays a central role in this process. We here describe a point mutation in such a sequence. Three sisters were shown to suffer from fish-eye disease (FED), a disorder which is caused by mutations in the gene coding for lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Sequencing of the LCAT gene of all three probands revealed compound heterozygosity for a missense mutation in exon 4 which is reported to underlie the FED phenotype, and a point mutation located in intron 4 (IVS4 T-22C). By performing in vitro expression of LCAT minigenes and reverse transcriptase PCR on mRNA isolated from leukocytes of the patient, this gene defect was shown to cause a null allele as the result of complete intron retention. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a point mutation in a lariat branchpoint consensus sequence causes a null allele in a patient with FED. In addition, our finding illustrates the importance of this sequence for normal human mRNA processing. Finally, this report provides a widely applicable strategy which ensures fast and effective screening for intronic defects that underlie differential gene expression..
The flavonoid apigenin delays forgetting of passive avoidance conditioning in rats.
The forkhead domain is a monomeric DNA binding motif that defines a rapidly growing family of eukaryotic transcriptional regulators. Genetic and biochemical data suggest a central role in embryonic development for genes encoding forkhead proteins. We have used PCR and low stringency hybridization to isolate clones from human cDNA and genomic libraries that represent seven novel forkhead genes, freac-1 to freac-7. The spatial patterns of expression for the seven freac genes range from specific for a single tissue to nearly ubiquitous. The DNA binding specificities of four of the FREAC proteins were determined by selection of binding sites from random sequence oligonucleotides. The binding sites for all four FREAC proteins share a core sequence, RTAAAYA, but differ in the positions flanking the core. Domain swaps between two FREAC proteins identified two subregions within the forkhead domain as responsible for creating differences in DNA binding specificity. Applying a circular permutation assay, we show that binding of FREAC proteins to their cognate sites results in bending of the DNA at an angle of 80-90 degrees.
The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is a selective RNA-binding protein whose function is implicated in regulating protein synthesis of its mRNA targets. The lack of FMRP leads to abnormal synapse development in the brain and impaired learning/memory. Although FMRP is predominantly expressed in neurons of the adult brain, whether FMRP also functions in glia during early development remains elusive, since expression of FMRP in glia has not been rigorously examined. This is an important question because recent studies revealed important roles of glia in synaptic development. Here we report that in addition to the observed neuronal expression, FMRP expression is detected in oligodendroglia progenitor cells (OPCs), immature oligodendrocytes and oligodendroglia cell lines, where it interacts with a subgroup of oligodendrocyte-specific mRNAs, including the myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNA. FMRP expression gradually declines as oligodendrocytes differentiate in vitro and in the developing brain. The decline of FMRP expression during oligodendrocyte differentiation is associated with a vigorous up-regulation of the MBP protein. In addition, we show that the MBP 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) is necessary and sufficient for binding FMRP, and mediates translation inhibition of a reporter gene by FMRP specifically in oligodendrocytes. These results support the hypothesis that FMRP may participate in regulating translation of its bound mRNAs in oligodendroglia during early brain development.
The frequency, origin, and phenotypic expression of a germline MSH2 gene mutation previously identified in seven kindreds with hereditary non-polyposis cancer syndrome (HNPCC) was investigated. The mutation (A-- > T at nt943 + 3) disrupts the 3 splice site of exon 5 leading to the deletion of this exon from MSH2 mRNA and represents the only frequent MSH2 mutation so far reported. Although this mutation was initially detected in four of 33 colorectal cancer families analysed from eastern England, more extensive analysis has reduced the frequency to four of 52 (8%) English HNPCC kindreds analysed. In contrast, the MSH2 mutation was identified in 10 of 20 (50%) separately identified colorectal families from Newfoundland. To investigate the origin of this mutation in colorectal cancer families from England (n = 4), Newfoundland (n = 10), and the United States (n = 3), haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers linked to MSH2 was performed. Within the English and US families there was little evidence for a recent common origin of the MSH2 splice site mutation in most families. In contrast, a common haplotype was identified at the two flanking markers (CA5 and D2S288) in eight of the Newfoundland families. These findings suggested a founder effect within Newfoundland similar to that reported by others for two MLH1 mutations in Finnish HNPCC families. We calculated age related risks of all, colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancers in nt943 + 3 A-- > T MSH2 mutation carriers (n = 76) for all patients and for men and women separately. For both sexes combined, the penetrances at age 60 years for all cancers and for colorectal cancer were 0. 86 and 0. 57, respectively. The risk of colorectal cancer was significantly higher (p < 0. 01) in males than females (0. 63 v 0. 30 and 0. 84 v 0. 44 at ages 50 and 60 years, respectively). For females there was a high risk of endometrial cancer (0. 5 at age 60 years) and premenopausal ovarian cancer (0. 2 at 50 years). These intersex differences in colorectal cancer risks have implications for screening programmes and for attempts to identify colorectal cancer susceptibility modifiers.
The function of P2X3 receptor and NK1 receptor antagonists on cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in rats.
The functional intronless gene coding for a calmodulin-like protein (CLP) has been localized to human chromosome 10p13-ter. Chromosomal assignment was performed by Southern blot analysis of DNA from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and amplification of a CLP gene-specific 1090-bp DNA fragment by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA from human-hamster cell hybrids. Chromosomal sublocalization was carried out by in situ hybridization of human chromosome metaphase spreads. The CLP gene is the first member of the human calmodulin/calmodulin-like gene family to be chromosomally sublocalized. Its presence near the telomeric end of the short arm of chromosome 10 may be of significance with respect to its highly (epithelial) cell-type restricted expression in vivo and strong downregulation upon malignant transformation. The generation of a human CLP gene-specific sequence tag site specified by the two primers used for PCR should prove useful for future linkage studies.
The gene Prph2 encodes a photoreceptor-specific membrane glycoprotein, peripherin-2 (also known as peripherin/rds), which is inserted into the rims of photoreceptor outer segment discs in a complex with rom-1 (ref. 2). The complex is necessary for the stabilization of the discs, which are renewed constantly throughout life, and which contain the visual pigments necessary for photon capture. Mutations in Prph2 have been shown to result in a variety of photoreceptor dystrophies, including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and macular dystrophy. A common feature of these diseases is the loss of photoreceptor function, also seen in the retinal degeneration slow (rds or Prph2 Rd2/Rd2) mouse, which is homozygous for a null mutation in Prph2. It is characterized by a complete failure to develop photoreceptor discs and outer segments, downregulation of rhodopsin and apoptotic loss of photoreceptor cells. The electroretinograms (ERGs) of Prph2Rd2/Rd2 mice have greatly diminished a-wave and b-wave amplitudes, which decline to virtually undetectable concentrations by two months. Subretinal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding a Prph2 transgene results in stable generation of outer segment structures and formation of new stacks of discs containing both perpherin-2 and rhodopsin, which in many cases are morphologically similar to normal outer segments. Moreover, the re-establishment of the structural integrity of the photoreceptor layer also results in electrophysiological correction. These studies demonstrate for the first time that a complex ultrastructural cell defect can be corrected both morphologically and functionally by in vivo gene transfer..
The gene encoding activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a member of the cytidine deaminase family, was isolated from a murine B cell lymphoma line, CH12F3-2, induced by combined stimulation of TGF-beta, IL-4, and CD40L. We have isolated the human orthologue of mouse AID cDNA, which has an open reading frame of 198 residues containing a conserved cytidine deaminase motif. The amino acid sequence of human AID is 92% identical to that of mouse AID. RT-PCR analysis of 15 human tissues showed that AID mRNA is expressed strongly in lymph nodes and tonsils. The complete human AID gene consisting of five exons was isolated and mapped to chromosome 12p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.
The gene encoding hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) is mutated in patients with primary hyperoxaluria type II.
The gene for CD59 [membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL), protectin], a phosphatidylinositol-linked surface glycoprotein that regulates the formation of the polymeric C9 complex of complement and that is deficient on the abnormal hematopoietic cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, consists of four exons spanning 20 kilobases. The untranslated first exon is preceded by a G+C-rich promoter region that lacks a consensus TATA or CAAT motif. The second exon encodes the hydrophobic leader sequence of the protein, and the third exon encodes the amino-terminal portion of the mature protein. The fourth exon encodes the remainder of the mature protein, including the hydrophobic sequence necessary for glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor attachment. The structure of the CD59 gene is very similar to that encoding Ly-6, a murine glycoprotein with which CD59 has some structural similarity. The striking similarity in gene structure is further evidence that the two proteins belong to a superfamily of proteins that may also include the urokinase plasminogen-activator receptor and a squid glycoprotein of unknown function.
The gene for ataxia-telangiectasia, ATM, spans about 150 kb of genomic DNA. ATM mutations are found along the entire gene, with no evidence of a mutational hot spot. Using DNA as the starting material, we screened the ATM gene in 92 A-T patients, using an optimized single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique that detected all previously known mutations in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) segments being analyzed. To expedite screening, we sequentially loaded the SSCP gels with three different sets of PCR products that were pretested to avoid overlapping patterns. Many of the DNA changes we detected were intragenic polymorphisms. Of an expected 177 unknown mutations, we detected approximately 70%, mostly protein truncating mutations (that would have been detectable by protein truncation testing if RNA starting material had been available). Mutations have now been defined for every exon of the ATM gene. Herein, we present 35 new mutations and 34 new intragenic polymorphisms or rare variants within the ATM gene. This is the most comprehensive compilation of ATM polymorphisms assembled to date. Defining polymorphic sites as well as mutations in the ATM gene will be of great importance in designing automated methods for detecting mutations..
The gene for familial Mediterranean fever, MEFV, is expressed in early leukocyte development and is regulated in response to inflammatory mediators.
The gene for hSK4, a novel human small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, or SK channel, has been identified and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In physiological saline hSK4 generates a conductance of approximately 12 pS, a value in close agreement with that of other cloned SK channels. Like other members of this family, the polypeptide encoded by hSK4 contains a previously unnoted leucine zipper-like domain in its C terminus of unknown function. hSK4 appears unique, however, in its very high affinity for Ca2+ (EC50 of 95 nM) and its predominant expression in nonexcitable tissues of adult animals. Together with the relatively low homology of hSK4 to other SK channel polypeptides (approximately 40% identical), these data suggest that hSK4 belongs to a novel subfamily of SK channels.
The gene for human apolipoprotein C2 (APOC2), situated on the proximal long arm of chromosome 19, is closely linked to the gene for the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy (DM). Six APOC2 RFLPs (TaqI, BglI, BanI, BamHI, NcoI, and AvaII) have been identified to date. We have conducted a comprehensive DM linkage study utilizing all six RFLPs and involving 50 families and 372 individuals. The most informative RFLPs are, in descending order, NcoI (lod = 6. 64, theta = 0. 05), BglI (lod = 6. 12, theta = 0. 05), AvaII (lod = 6. 02, theta = 0. 03), BanI (lod = 5. 76, theta = 0. 04), TaqI (lod = 4. 29, theta = 0. 06), and BamHI (lod = 1. 75, theta = 0. 01). A substantial increase in the lod scores over those seen with the individual RFLPs was obtained when the linkage of the entire APOC2 haplotype (composed of the six RFLPs) was studied (lod = 17. 87, theta = 0. 04). We have observed significant inter-APOC2 RFLP linkage disequilibrium. Consequently, the three most informative RFLPs have been found to be BanI, TaqI, and either BglI, AvaII, or NcoI polymorphisms. We also demonstrate linkage disequilibrium between DM and APOC2 in our French-Canadian population (standardized disequilibrium constant phi =. 22, chi 2 = 5. 12, df = 1, P less than 0. 04). This represents the first evidence of linkage disequilibrium between APOC2 and the DM locus.
The gene for spinal cerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) is located in a region of approximately 3 cM on chromosome 14q24.3-q32.2.
The gene for the human dolichol cycle GlcNAc-1-P transferase (ALG7/GPT) was cloned by screening a human lung fibroblast cDNA library. The library was constructed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector, and the positive clone was identified by complementation of the conditional lethal S.cerevisiae strain YPH-A7-GAL. This strain was constructed by replacing the endogenous promoter of the GPT-gene by the stringently regulated GAL1-promoter. This construct allows to specifically suppress the endogenous enzyme activity. The insert of the positive clone displayed an open reading frame of 1200 nucleotides, coding for a putative protein of 400 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 44.7 kDa. The deduced protein sequence shows a homology of over 90% when compared with other mammalian GPT sequences, thus resembling the close phylogenetic relationship between mammalian species. This homology however decreases to 40-50% when compared to more distantly related organisms such as S.cerevisiae , Schizosaccharomyces pombe , or Leishmania amazonensis . Biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein showed that it is functionally expressed in the S.cerevisiae strain YPH-A7-GAL. GlcNAc- and GlcNAc2-PP-Dolichol biosynthesis could be shown with isolated S.cerevisiae membranes from cells harboring the recombinant plasmid and grown on glucose thus suppressing transcription of the endogenous gene. Synthesis could be stimulated by dolicholphosphate and was inhibited by tunicamycin. These results show that we have cloned the human GlcNAc-1-P transferase by heterologous complementation in S. cerevisiae, a strategy that may be useful for the cloning and characterization of glycosyltransferases from a variety of organisms.
The gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) patients, denoted ATM, encodes a putative protein or lipid kinase. To elucidate the functions of ATM, we disrupted the mouse ATM gene through homologous recombination in mice. Consistent with cellular defects of AT patients, the ATM-/- cells are hypersensitive to gamma-irradiation and defective in cell-cycle arrest following radiation, correlating with a defective up-regulation of p53. In addition, ATM-/- mouse thymocytes are more resistant to apoptosis induced by gamma-irradiation than normal thymocytes. ATM-/- fibroblasts are inefficient in G1 to S-phase progression following serum stimulation and senesce after only a few passages in culture. They have an increased constitutive level of p21CP1/WAF1. The ATM protein is therefore critical both for cellular responses to ionizing radiation and for normal cell-cycle progression. ATM +/- fibroblasts and thymocytes showed intermediately defective responses to irradiation but no growth defect, suggesting that the increased cancer risk of AT heterozygotes could be attributable to poor checkpoint function..
The gene responsible for Huntington disease has been localized to a 2. 5 million base pair (Mb) region between the loci D4S10 and D4S168 on the short arm of chromosome 4. As part of a strategy to clone the HD gene on the basis of its chromosomal location, we isolated genomic DNA from the HD region as a set of overlapping yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones. Twenty-eight YAC clones were identified by screening human YAC libraries with twelve PCR-based sequence-tagged sites (STSs) from the region. We assembled the YAC clones into overlapping sets by hybridizing them to a large number of DNA probes from the HD region, including the STSs. In addition, we isolated the ends of the human DNA inserts of most of the YAC clones to assist in the construction of the contig. Although almost half of the YACs appear to contain chimeric inserts and several contain internal deletions or other rearrangements, we were able to obtain over 2. 2 Mb of the HD region in YACs, including one continuous segment of 2. 0 Mb covering the region that most likely contains the HD gene. Ten of the twenty eight YAC clones comprise a minimal set spanning the 2. 2 Mb. These clones provide reagents for the complete characterization of this region of the genome and for the eventual isolation of the HD gene.
The genetic basis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with its complex etiology is still largely elusive. Plasma levels of lipids and apolipoproteins are among the major quantitative risk factors for CVD and are well-established intermediate traits that may be more accessible to genetic dissection than clinical CVD end points. Chromosome 19 harbors multiple genes that have been suggested to play a role in lipid metabolism and previous studies indicated the presence of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for cholesterol levels in genetic isolates. To establish the relevance of genetic variation at chromosome 19 for plasma levels of lipids and apolipoproteins in the general, out-bred Caucasian population, we performed a linkage study in four independent samples, including adolescent Dutch twins and adult Dutch, Swedish and Australian twins totaling 493 dizygotic twin pairs. The average spacing of short-tandem-repeat markers was 6-8 cM. In the three adult twin samples, we found consistent evidence for linkage of chromosome 19 with LDL cholesterol levels (maximum LOD scores of 4.5, 1.7 and 2.1 in the Dutch, Swedish and Australian sample, respectively); no indication for linkage was observed in the adolescent Dutch twin sample. The QTL effects in the three adult samples were not significantly different and a simultaneous analysis of the samples increased the maximum LOD score to 5.7 at 60 cM pter. Bivariate analyses indicated that the putative LDL-C QTL also contributed to the variance in ApoB levels, consistent with the high genetic correlation between these phenotypes. Our study provides strong evidence for the presence of a QTL on chromosome 19 with a major effect on LDL-C plasma levels in outbred Caucasian populations.
The genetic basis of myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the expansion of an unstable CTG repeat in the 34 UTR of the DM protein kinase gene on chromosome 19. One of the principal features of the DM mutation is an extraordinarily high level of somatic mosaicism, due to an extremely high degree of somatic instability both within and between different tissues. This instability appears to be biased towards further expansion and continuous throughout the life of an individual, features that could be associated with the progressive nature of the disease. Although increasing measured allele size between patients clearly correlates with an increased severity of symptoms and an earlier age of onset, this correlation is not precise and measured allele length cannot be used as an accurate predictor of age of onset. In order to further characterize the dynamics of DM CTG repeat somatic instability, we have studied repeat length changes over time in 111 myotonic dystrophy patients with varying clinical severity and CTG repeat size over time intervals of 1-7 years. We have found a direct progression of the size heterogeneity over time related to initial CTG repeat size and the time interval and always biased towards further expansion. Attempts to mathematically model the dynamics have proved only partially successful suggesting that individual specific genetic and/or environmental factors also play a role in somatic mosaicism..
The genetic defects responsible for most phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) cases are located in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Approximately 50-60 mutations have been reported in Caucasians and are reflected in a wide range of clinical severities. Most mutations are linked to specific haplotypes, as defined by eight polymorphic restriction sites in the PAH gene. We hypothesized that there is at least one mild mutation linked to haplotype 12 in the Swedish PKU/HPA population, since 7 of 8 patients carrying haplotype 12 had mild HPA. Sequence analysis revealed a C-to-G transversion at the second base of codon 322, resulting in a substitution of glycine for alanine, in four mutant haplotype 12 genes, and a G-to-A transition at the second base of codon 408, resulting in a substitution of glutamine for arginine, in another three mutant haplotype 12 genes. These mutations segregated with mutant haplotype 12 alleles in nuclear families but were not present on normal or other mutant alleles. Both mutations were tested in a eukaryotic expression system in which enzyme activities of different mutant PAH enzymes reflect the relative severities of the mutations, although these in vitro activities cannot be translated directly into in vivo hepatic activities. The A322G mutant PAH had about 75% and the R408Q mutant PAH about 55% of the wild-type PAH enzyme activity. These in vitro activities are the highest reported for mutant PAH enzymes produced in the same expression system. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).
The giant 358-kDa protein Ran binding protein 2 (RanBP2/Nup358) is localized at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex and likely constitutes the Ran-GTP binding site at the cytoplasmic face of the complex. RanBP2/Nup358 furthermore acts as a chaperone for red/green opsin molecules. Here, we report on the physical mapping of human RanBP2 between markers D2S340 and D2S1893. A duplication of the 5'-end sequence of RanBP2 occurs within 3 Mb distal to RanBP2. Detailed sequence analysis resulted in primers specific for this distal duplication. Polymerase chain reaction-based screening of cDNA libraries indicates that this transcript, called RanBP2alpha (HGMW-approved symbol RANBP2L1), is expressed in several tissues. Screening of a fetal brain cDNA library yielded a 4057-bp partial cDNA clone for RanBP2alpha. Its 5'-end is almost identical to RanBP2, whereas its 3'-part is distinct from RanBP2. Northern blot analysis using a probe of the 3'-untranslated sequence of RanBP2alpha detected in several tissues an 8-kb transcript representing the full length of the transcript. In pancreas and placenta, an additional transcript of 14 kb was detected. PAC clones containing the bona fide RanBP2 sequences were localized to 2q11-q12 by FISH analysis, and a region of high similarity was detected on 2p11-p12. In summary, we have identified a RanBP2 gene cluster on 2q11-q12 together with a novel gene termed RanBP2alpha, with high sequence similarity to RanBP2. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.
The giant myofibrillar protein titin contains within its C-terminal region a serine-threonine kinase of unknown function. We have identified a novel muscle specific RING finger protein, referred to as MURF-1, that binds in vitro to the titin repeats A168/A169 adjacent to the titin kinase domain. In myofibrils, MURF-1 is present within the periphery of the M-line lattice in close proximity to titin's catalytic kinase domain, within the Z-line lattice, and also in soluble form within the cytoplasm. Yeast two-hybrid screens with MURF-1 as a bait identified two other highly homologous MURF proteins, MURF-2 and MURF-3. MURF-1,2,3 proteins are encoded by distinct genes, share highly conserved N-terminal RING domains and in vitro form dimers/heterodimers by shared coiled-coil motifs. Of the MURF family, only MURF-1 interacts with titin repeats A168/A169, whereas MURF-3 has been reported to affect microtubule stability. Association of MURF-1 with M-line titin may potentially modulate titin's kinase activity similar to other known kinase-associated proteins, whereas differential expression and heterodimerization of MURF1, 2 and 3 may link together titin kinase and microtubule-dependent signal pathways in striated muscles.

The glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction. In a counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design, healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic S-ketamine infusion while differences in BOLD responses measured with fMRI were detected. During the scanning period, subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks (phonological, lexical and semantic). Ketamine-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology. Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and ketamine for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. Ketamine led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency. Ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDA receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
The glycine transporter-1 inhibitor SSR103800 displays a selective and specific antipsychotic-like profile in normal and transgenic mice.
The glycosylation of serine and threonine residues during mucin-type O-linked protein glycosylation is carried out by a family of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-transferase). Previously two members, GalNAc-T1 and -T2, have been isolated and the genes cloned and characterized. Here we report the cDNA cloning and expression of a novel GalNAc-transferase termed GalNAc-T3. The gene was isolated and cloned based on the identification of a GalNAc-transferase motif (61 amino acids) that is shared between GalNAc-T1 and -T2 as well as a homologous Caenorhabditis elegans gene. The cDNA sequence has a 633-amino acid coding region indicating a protein of 72.5 kDa with a type II domain structure. The overall amino acid sequence similarity with GalNAc-T1 and -T2 is approximately 45%; 12 cysteine residues that are shared between GalNAc-T1 and -T2 are also found in GalNAc-T3. GalNAc-T3 was expressed as a soluble protein without the hydrophobic transmembrane domain in insect cells using a Baculo-virus vector, and the expressed GalNAc-transferase activity showed substrate specificity different from that previously reported for GalNAc-T1 and -T2. Northern analysis of human organs revealed a very restricted expression pattern of GalNAc-T3.
The goal of this study was to assess mitochondrial function and ROS production in an experimental model of cocaine-induced cardiac dysfunction. We hypothesized that cocaine abuse may lead to altered mitochondrial function that in turn may cause left ventricular dysfunction. Seven days of cocaine administration to rats led to an increased oxygen consumption detected in cardiac fibers, specifically through complex I and complex III. ROS levels were increased, specifically in interfibrillar mitochondria. In parallel there was a decrease in ATP synthesis, whereas no difference was observed in subsarcolemmal mitochondria. This uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation was not detectable after short-term exposure to cocaine, suggesting that these mitochondrial abnormalities were a late rather than a primary event in the pathological response to cocaine. MitoQ, a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, was shown to completely prevent these mitochondrial abnormalities as well as cardiac dysfunction characterized here by a diastolic dysfunction studied with a conductance catheter to obtain pressure-volume data. Taken together, these results extend previous studies and demonstrate that cocaine-induced cardiac dysfunction may be due to a mitochondrial defect.
The goal of this study was to assess the interactive effects of chronic anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) exposure and brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) depletion on behavior of pubertal male rats. Serotonin was depleted beginning on postnatal day 26 with parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA 100 mg/kg, every other day); controls received saline. At puberty (P40), half the PCPA-treated rats and half the saline-treated rats began treatment with testosterone (T, 5 mg/kg, 5 days/week). Behavioral measures included locomotion, irritability, copulation, partner preference, and aggression. Animals were tested for aggression in their home cage, both with and without physical provocation (mild tail pinch). Brain levels of 5-HT and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were determined using HPLC. PCPA significantly and substantially depleted 5-HT and 5-HIAA in all brain regions examined. Chronic T treatment significantly decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA in certain brain areas, but to a much lesser extent than PCPA. Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased irritability but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or aggression. T alone had no effect on locomotion, irritability, or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and aggression. The most striking effect of combining T+PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack, particularly following physical provocation. Based on these data, it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central 5-HT may be especially prone to exhibit aggressive behavior.
The group of dominant non-dystrophic myotonias, comprising disorders characterized by clinically similar forms of myogenic muscle stiffness, is genetically inhomogeneous. Dominant myotonia congenita (Thomsens disease) is linked to CLCN1, the gene encoding the major muscle chloride channel, localized on chromosome 7q35. In contrast, dominant myotonias sensitive to potassium are caused by point mutations in SCN4A on chromosome 17q, the gene for the alpha subunit of the adult skeletal muscle sodium channel. No linkage or molecular genetic data are as yet available on myotonia levior characterized by milder symptoms and later onset of myotonia than in Thomsens disease, and absence of muscle hypertrophy. We report a CLCN1 Gln-552-Arg substitution for a family with dominant inheritance previously diagnosed to have myotonia levior. Thus, this disorder appears as a variant of Thomsens disease due to mutations leading to low clinical expressivity. In addition, we report a novel Ile-290-Met CLCN1 mutation for a typical Thomsen pedigree. In another family previously diagnosed as having Thomsens disease, we unexpectedly found a CLCN1 14 bp deletion known to cause recessive myotonia, and a rare Trp-118-Gly polymorphism..
The hLIMD1 gene is located at chromosome 3p21 and was identified as a putative tumor suppressor gene using an elimination test assay. Chromosome 3p21 loci are frequently deleted in a number of cancers, including breast. The 3p21.3 locus harbors a number of tumor suppressor candidates, including LIMD1, a member of the ZYXIN family of genes. LIMD1 directly interacts with RB and is thought to play a role in suppressing tumor growth. To investigate whether mutations in the LIMD1 gene could potentially be involved in breast cancer, we used single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis on DNA from 235 breast cancers and 95 controls. We identified four novel coding region alterations, including two amino acid substitutions at positions 255 and 302. The two remaining novel variants were found at amino acid positions 246 and 647 and encoded silent alterations. The rare Ser255Arg variant was identified in only sporadic breast tumors (2/165 tumors). Some ZYXIN proteins are phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinases, and the Ser255Arg change is located in a region phosphorylated on serine residues. Together, the data suggest that this variant may warrant further characterization.
The hSNF5/INI1 gene which encodes a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin ATP-dependent remodeling complex, is a new tumor suppressor gene localized on chromosome 22q11. 2 and recently shown to be mutated in malignant rhabdoid tumors. We have searched for hSNF5/INI1 mutations in 229 tumors of various origins using a screening method based on denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. A total of 31 homozygous deletions and 36 point alterations were identified. Point mutations were scattered along the coding sequence and included 15 nonsense, 15 frameshift, three splice site, two missense and one editing mutations. Mutations were retrieved in most rhabdoid tumors, whatever their sites of occurrence, indicating the common pathogenetic origin of these tumors. Recurrent hSNF5/INI1 alterations were also observed in choroid plexus carcinomas and in a subset of central primitive neuroectodermal tumors (cPNETs) and medulloblastomas. In contrast, hSNF5/INI1 point mutations were not detected in breast cancers, Wilms tumors, gliomas, ependymomas, sarcomas and other tumor types, even though most analyzed cases harbored loss of heterozygosity at 22q11. 2 loci. These results suggest that rhabdoid tumors, choroid plexus carcinomas and a subset of medulloblastomas and cPNETs share common pathways of oncogenesis related to hSNF5/INI1 alteration and that hSNF5/INI1 mutations define a genetically homogeneous family of highly aggressive cancers mainly occurring in young children and frequently, but not always, exhibiting a rhabdoid phenotype
The haemodynamic effects of propofol in combination with ephedrine in elderly patients (ASA groups 3 and 4).
The half-life (t1/2) of cocaine is relatively short, but some of the consequences of its use, such as seizures and strokes, can occur hours after exposure. This led us to hypothesize that a metabolite of cocaine may be responsible for some of those delayed sequelae. We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BE), to cause seizures. Two separate equimolar doses (0.2 and 0.4 mumol) of either cocaine or BE were injected ventricularly in unanesthetized juvenile rats. Treated rats were then evaluated for incidence, latency, and seizure pattern or for locomotor activity in animals without seizures. BE-Induced seizures occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of cocaine. Whereas cocaine-induced seizures were best characterized as brief, generalized, and tonic and resulted in death, those induced by BE were prolonged, often multiple and mixed in type, and rarely resulted in death. Electrical recordings from the hippocampus showed a rhythmic progression in EEG frequency and voltage with clinical seizure expression. BE-Injected rats that did not have seizures had significantly more locomotor activity than cocaine-injected animals without seizures. The finding that cocaine- and BE-induced seizures differ in several respects suggests more than one mechanism for cocaine-induced seizures and emphasizes the importance of a cocaine metabolite, BE.

The hemochromatosis 845 G-->A and 187 C-->G mutations: prevalence in non-Caucasian populations.
The hemochromatosis gene (HFE) maps to 6p21. 3 and is less than 1 cM from the HLA class I genes; however, the precise physical location of the gene has remained elusive and controversial. The unambiguous identification of a crossover event within hemochromatosis families is very difficult; it is particularly hampered by the variability of the phenotypic expression as well as by the sex- and age-related penetrance of the disease. For these practical considerations, traditional linkage analysis could prove of limited value in further refining the extrapolated physical position of HFE. We therefore embarked upon a linkage-disequilibrium analysis of HFE and normal chromosomes from the Brittany population. In the present report, 66 hemochromatosis families yielding 151 hemochromatosis chromosomes and 182 normal chromosomes were RFLP-typed with a battery of probes, including two newly derived polymorphic markers from the 6. 7 and HLA-F loci located 150 and 250 kb telomeric to HLA-A, respectively. The results suggest a strong peak of existing linkage disequilibrium focused within the i82-to-6. 7 interval (approximately 250 kb). The zone of linkage disequilibrium is flanked by the i97 locus, positioned 30 kb proximal to i82, and the HLA-F gene, found 250 kb distal to HLA-A, markers of which display no significant association with HFE. These data support the possibility that HFE resides within the 400-kb expanse of DNA between i97 and HLA-F. Alternatively, the very tight association of HLA-A3 and allele 1 of the 6. 7 locus, both of which are comprised by the major ancestral or founder HFE haplotype in Brittany, supports the possibility that the disease gene may reside immediately telomeric to the 6. 7 locus within the linkage-disequilibrium zone. Additionally, hemochromatosis haplotypes possessing HLA-A11 and the low-frequency HLA-F polymorphism (allele 2) are supportive of a separate founder chromosome containing a second, independently arising mutant allele. Overall, the establishment of a likely " hemochromatosis critical region " centromeric boundary and the identification of a linkage-disequilibrium zone both significantly contribute to a reduction in the amount of DNA required to be searched for novel coding sequences constituting the HFE defect
The hemochromatosis gene product complexes with the transferrin receptor and lowers its affinity for ligand binding.
The hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of dronedarone, a noniodinated compound structurally related to amiodarone, were compared with those of amiodarone after prolonged oral administration, both at rest and during sympathetic stimulation in conscious dogs with a healed myocardial infarction. All dogs (n = 6) randomly received orally dronedarone (10 and 30 mg/kg), amiodarone (10 and 30 mg/kg), and placebo twice daily for 7 days, with a 3-week washout between consecutive treatments. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MBP), positive rate of increase of left ventricular pressure (+LVdP/dt), echocardiographically assessed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and fractional shortening (FS), as well as chronotropic response to isoproterenol and exercise-induced sympathetic stimulation were evaluated under baseline and posttreatment conditions. Resting values of LVEF, FS, +LVdP/dt, and MBP remained unchanged whatever the drug and the dosing regimen, whereas resting HR was significantly and dose-dependently lowered after dronedarone and to a lesser extent after amiodarone. Both dronedarone and amiodarone significantly reduced the exercise-induced tachycardia and, at the highest dose, decreased the isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Thus, dronedarone and amiodarone displayed a similar level of antiadrenergic effect and did not impair the resting left ventricular function. Consequently, dronedarone might be particularly suitable for the treatment and prevention of various clinical arrhythmias, without compromising the left ventricular function.
The hemodynamic effects of captopril and other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be mediated by the endogenous opioid system. The opioid antagonist naloxone has been shown to block or reverse the hypotensive actions of captopril. We report a case of an intentional captopril overdose, manifested by marked hypotension, that resolved promptly with the administration of naloxone. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of captopril-induced hypotension treated with naloxone. Our experience demonstrates a possible role of naloxone in the reversal of hypotension resulting from captopril.
The hemodynamics of oxytocin and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery: findings in six cases.
The hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene, BRCA1, encodes a large polypeptide that contains the cysteine-rich RING motif, a zinc-binding domain found in a variety of regulatory proteins. Here we describe a novel protein that interacts in vivo with the N-terminal region of BRCA1. This BRCA1-associated RING domain (BARD1) protein contains an N-terminal RING motif, three tandem ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal sequence with significant homology to the phylogenetically conserved BRCT domains that lie near the C terminus of BRCA1. The BARD1/BRCA1 interaction is disrupted by BRCA1 missense mutations that segregate with breast cancer susceptibility, indicating that BARD1 may be involved in mediating tumour suppression by BRCA1..
The hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is associated with a high frequency of BRCA1 mutations. However, the widespread use of BRCA1 testing has been limited to date by three principal concerns the fear of loss of health and life insurance, the uncertain clinical value of a positive test result, and the current lack of an inexpensive and sensitive screening test for BRCA1 mutations. We have developed an inexpensive system for gene mutational scanning, based on a combination of extensive multiplex PCR amplification and two dimensional electrophoresis. The efficiency of this system, as a screening test for BRCA1 mutations, was evaluated in a panel of 60 samples from high risk women, 14 of which contained a previously identified mutation in BRCA1. All 14 mutations were identified, as well as an additional five that had previously escaped detection. In addition to the 19 mutations, a total of 15 different polymorphic variants were scored, most of which were recurring. All were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The cost of screening per sample was calculated to be approximately US $ 70 for the manual technique used in this study, and may be reduced to approximately US $ 10 with the introduction of commercially available PCR robotics and fluorescent imaging. Implementation of this method of mutation screening in the research and clinical setting should permit rapid accrual of quantitative data on genotype-phenotype associations for the evaluation of diagnostic testing..
The hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, specifically regulates transferrin-mediated iron uptake in HeLa cells.
The high prevalence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in African populations is due almost entirely to the enzyme variant A-, which differs from the wild-type G6PD B by two amino acid replacements, 68 Val-- > Met and 126 Asn-- > Asp. The non-deficient polymorphic variant G6PD A contains only the mutation 126 Asn-- > Asp. The frequencies of the G6PD A and of the G6PD A- genes in parts of Africa are both about 0. 2. The 68 Val-- > Met mutation has not been found in a B background. This could be because the 68 Val-- > Met mutation happened to arise in an A gene in the first instance, or because the 68 Val-- > Met mutation alone is not sufficient to cause G6PD deficiency. We have approached this question by producing G6PD B, A, A-, and G6PD 68 Val-- > Met in a bacterial expression system and analysing their biochemical properties. With each single mutation we found a slight decrease in both the specific activity and the yield of enzyme when compared to G6PD B. When both mutations were introduced together, there was a roughly additive effect on specific activity, but a much more drastic effect on enzyme yield (4% of normal). This synergistic effect was also demonstrated on thermal stability, especially at low NADP concentrations. Comparable results were produced when the replacement 119 Gln-- > Glu was studied instead of 126 Asn-- > Asp. We infer that the coexistence of the two mutations is responsible for enzyme deficiency in G6PD A- because they act synergistically in causing instability of the enzyme.
The highly-selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine (D-MED) is capable of inducing muscle flaccidity and anesthesia in rats and dogs. Intense generalized muscle rigidity is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists. Although the neurochemistry of opiate-induced rigidity has yet to be fully elucidated, recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism. In the present study, the authors determined if treatment with D-MED prevents the muscle rigidity caused by high-dose alfentanil anesthesia in the rat. Animals (n = 42) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens: 1) L-MED (the inactive L-isomer of medetomidine), 30 micrograms/kg; 2) D-MED, 10 micrograms/kg; 3) D-MED, 30 micrograms/kg; 4) D-MED [30 micrograms/kg] and the central-acting alpha-2 antagonist, idazoxan [10 mg/kg]; 5) D-MED [30 micrograms/kg] and the peripheral-acting alpha-2 antagonist DG-5128 [10 mg/kg], or; 6) saline. Baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment. Each rat was then injected with alfentanil (ALF, 0.5 mg/kg sc). ALF injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L-MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline. In contrast, D-MED prevented alfentanil-induced muscle rigidity in a dose-dependent fashion. The small EMG values obtained in the high-dose D-MED group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate. The high-dose D-MED animals were flaccid, akinetic, and lacked a startle response during the entire experimental period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The human AHR: identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms from six ethnic populations.
The human E48 antigen, highly homologous to the murine Ly-6 antigen ThB, is a GPI-anchored molecule apparently involved in keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion.
The human ELL gene, which is a frequent target for translocation in acute myeloid leukemia, was initially isolated from rat liver nuclei and found to be an RNA polymerase II elongation factor. Based on homology to ELL, we later cloned ELL2 and demonstrated that it can also increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. To better understand the role of ELL proteins in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, we have initiated a search for proteins related to ELLs. In this report, we describe the molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of ELL3, a novel RNA polymerase II elongation factor approximately 50% similar to both ELL and ELL2. Our transcriptional studies have demonstrated that ELL3 can also increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. The C-terminal domain of ELL, which we recently demonstrated to be required and sufficient for the immortalization of myeloid progenitor cells, shares strong similarities to the C-terminal domain of ELL3. ELL3 was localized by immunofluorescence to the nucleus of cells, and Northern analysis indicated that ELL3 is a testis-specific RNA polymerase II elongation factor.
The human GRAF gene is fused to MLL in a unique t(5;11)(q31;q23) and both alleles are disrupted in three cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia with a deletion 5q.
The human Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare neurological and behavioural disorder, affecting only males, which is caused by an inherited deficiency in the level of activity of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanosine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT). How the resulting alterations in purine metabolism lead to the severe symptoms characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan patients is still not understood. No mutations at the Hprt locus leading to loss of activity have been described in laboratory animals. To derive an animal model for the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, we have used cultured mouse embryonic stem cells, mutagenized by retroviral insertion and selected for loss of HPRT activity, to construct chimaeric mice. Two clonal lines carrying different mutant Hprt alleles have given rise to germ cells in chimaeras, allowing the derivation of strains of mutant mice having the same biochemical defect as Lesch-Nyhan patients. Male mice carrying the mutant alleles are viable and analysis of their cells shows a total lack of HPRT activity..
The human MAGEL2 gene and its mouse homologue are paternally expressed and mapped to the Prader-Willi region.
The human X-linked gene encoding glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is highly polymorphic; more than 300 G6PD variants have been identified. G6PD deficiency in different geographical areas appears to have arisen through independent mutational events, but within the same population it may also be heterogeneous. One example is the island of Sardinia, where careful clinical and biochemical studies have identified four different G6PD variants. We cloned and sequenced the four G6PD variants from Sardinia and found that only two mutations are responsible for G6PD deficiency in this area one mutation is the cause of the G6PD Seattle-like phenotype, a milder form of G6PD deficiency; the other mutation is responsible for all forms of very severe G6PD deficiency in Sardinia and, possibly, in the Mediterranean..
The human complement C9 gene: identification of two mutations causing deficiency and revision of the gene structure.
The human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein, UL16, binds to two members of a novel family of molecules, the ULBPs, and to the MHC class I homolog, MICB. The ULBPs are GPI-linked glycoproteins belonging to the extended MHC class I family but are only distantly related to MICB. The ULBP and MICB molecules are ligands for the activating receptor, NKG2D/DAP10, and this interaction is blocked by a soluble form of UL16. The ULBPs stimulate cytokine and chemokine production from NK cells, and expression of ULBPs in NK cell-resistant target cells confers susceptibility to NK cell cytotoxicity. Masking of NK cell recognition of ULBP or MIC antigens by UL16 provides a potential mechanism by which human cytomegalovirus-infected cells might evade attack by the immune system.
The human eye malformation aniridia results from haploinsufficiency of PAX6, a paired box DNA-binding protein. To study this dosage effect, we characterized two PAX6 mutations in a family segregating aniridia and a milder syndrome consisting of congenital cataracts and late onset corneal dystrophy. The nonsense mutations, at codons 103 and 353, truncate PAX6 within the N-terminal paired and C-terminal PST domains, respectively. The wild-type PST domain activates transcription autonomously and the mutant form has partial activity. A compound heterozygote had severe craniofacial and central nervous system defects and no eyes. The pattern of malformations is similar to that in homozygous Sey mice and suggests a critical role for PAX6 in controlling the migration and differentiation of specific neuronal progenitor cells in the brain..
The human factor IX gene as germline mutagen test: samples from Mainland China have the putatively endogenous pattern of mutation.
The human flavin-containing monooxygenases catalyze the oxygenation of nucleophilic heteroatom-containing drugs, xenobiotics and endogenous materials. Evidence for six forms of the FMO gene exist but it is FMO form 3 (FMO3) that is the prominent form in adult human liver that is likely to be associated with the bulk of FMO-mediated metabolism. An understanding of the substrate specificity of human FMO3 is beginning to emerge and several examples of drugs and chemicals extensively metabolized by FMO3 have been reported. Expression of FMO3 is species- and tissue-specific, but unlike human cytochrome P450 (CYP450), mammalian FMO3 does not appear to be inducible. Interindividual variation in FMO3-dependent metabolism of drugs, chemicals and endogenous materials is therefore more likely to be due to genetic and not environmental effects. Certain mutations of the human FMO3 gene have been associated with abnormal N-oxygenation of trimethylamine. Deficient N-oxygenation of trimethylamine results in a condition called trimethylaminuria. Some treatment strategies for this inborn error of metabolism are discussed. Other common variants of the FMO3 gene including E158K, V257M and E308G have been observed. It is possible that allelic variation of human FMO3 causes abnormal metabolism of chemicals and has clinical implications for human drug metabolism, but this is an understudied area. Human FMO3 allelic variation may eventually be shown to contribute to interindividual and interethnic variability in FMO3-mediated metabolism. Human FMO3 may be another example of an environmental gene that participates in a protective mechanism to help shield humans from potentially toxic exposure to chemicals. Heterogeneity in the relative frequencies of single and multiple site alleles, haplotypes and genotypes of the human FMO3 amongst various ethnic groups suggests population differences.
The human gene encoding a novel tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen (TIN-ag)-related protein (TIN-ag-RP) was isolated, and its genomic organization was determined. BLAST searches revealed the highest degree of homology to several mammalian TIN-ag orthologues, and a weak homology to cathepsin B-like proteases. The 12 kb gene was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization to chromosome 1p34.2-3, a locus neither related to that of the human TIN-ag (6p11.2-12) nor to that of cathepsin B (8p22-23.1). The TIN-ag-RP is encoded in ten exons with introns ranging from 83 bp to 4 kb. In addition, the gene contained one exon in the 5'UTR, but none in the 3'UTR. Five of the 10 splice sites of the TIN-ag-RP gene were fully conserved when compared to a related gene of C. elegans, whereas only one splice site was identical to those found in cathepsin B genes. Furthermore, human TIN-ag-RP tagged with the T7-epitope, was expressed in HeLa cells, and was found to be localized in vesicular compartments as well as secreted into the medium suggesting the involvement of the endosomal trafficking pathway. Based on the high degree of homology of the amino acid sequences and genomic organization between TIN-ag-RP and TIN-ag, we suggest that both molecules may form a distinct group or family of TIN-ag-like proteins.

The human gene for alkaptonuria (AKU) maps to chromosome 3q.
The human gene for histidase (histidine ammonia-lyase; HAL), the enzyme deficient in histidinemia, was assigned to human chromosome 12 by Southern blot analysis of human X mouse somatic cell hybrid DNA. The gene was sublocalized to region 12q22----q24. 1 by in situ hybridization, using a human histidase cDNA. The homologous locus in the mouse (Hal) was mapped to region 10C2----D1 by in situ hybridization, using a cell line from a mouse homozygous for a 1. 10 Robertsonian translocation. These assignments extend the conserved syntenic region between human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 10 that includes the genes for phenylalanine hydroxylase, gamma interferon, peptidase, and citrate synthase. The localization of histidase to mouse chromosome 10 suggests that the histidase regulatory locus (Hsd) and the histidinemia mutation (his), which are both known to be on chromosome 10, may be alleles of the histidase structural gene locus.
The human genome is far smaller than originally estimated, and one explanation is that alternative splicing creates greater proteomic complexity than a simple count of open reading frames would suggest. The p53 homologue p63, for example, is a tetrameric transcription factor implicated in epithelial development and expressed as at least six isoforms with widely differing transactivation potential. In particular, p63alpha isoforms contain a 27-kDa C-terminal region that drastically reduces their activity and is of clear biological importance, since patients with deletions in this C terminus have phenotypes very similar to patients with mutations in the DNA-binding domain. We have identified a novel domain within this C terminus that is necessary and sufficient for transcriptional inhibition and which acts by binding to a region in the N-terminal transactivation domain of p63 homologous to the MDM2 binding site in p53. Based on this mechanism, we provide a model that explains the transactivation potential of homo- and heterotetramers composed of different p63 isoforms and their effect on p53.
The human glycine receptor beta subunit: primary structure, functional characterisation and chromosomal localisation of the human and murine genes.
The human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit gene (CHRNA4) is located in the candidate region for three different phenotypes benign familial neonatal convulsions, autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and low-voltage EEG. Recently, a missense mutation in transmembrane domain 2 of CHRNA4 was found to be associated with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy in one extended pedigree. We have determined the genomic organization of CHRNA4, which consists of six exons distributed over approximately 17 kb of genomic DNA. The nucleotide sequence obtained from the genomic regions adjacent to the exon boundaries enabled us to develop a set of primer pairs for PCR amplification of the complete coding region. The sequence analysis provides the basis for a comprehensive mutation screening of CHRNA4 in the above-mentioned phenotypes and possibly in other types of idiopathic epilepsies..
The human pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein (PS beta G) and the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related proteins are members of the same multigene family.
The human thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein (TRAP)-Mediator complex was originally identified as a large multimeric complex that copurifies with the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) from HeLa cells and markedly enhances TR-mediated transcription in vitro. More recent studies have implicated TRAP-Mediator as a coactivator for a broad range of nuclear hormone receptors as well as other classes of transcriptional activators. Here we present evidence that TRAP-Mediator plays a functional role in androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcription. We show that several subunits of the complex ligand-dependently coimmunoprecipitate with AR from both prostate cancer LNCaP cells and from HeLa cells stably transfected with AR. The 220-kDa subunit of the complex (TRAP220) can contact the ligand-binding domain of AR in vitro, possibly implicating TRAP220 involvement in targeting AR to the holocomplex. Consistent with a TRAP-Mediator coactivator role, transient overexpression of the TRAP220, TRAP170, and TRAP100 subunits enhanced ligand-dependent transcription by AR in cultured cells. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that TRAP220 is recruited to the androgen-responsive prostate-specific antigen gene promoter in vivo in ligand-stimulated LNCaP cells. Collectively, these data suggest that TRAP-Mediator may play an important coregulatory role in AR-mediated gene expression.

The illicit use of cocaine continues in epidemic proportions and treatment for cocaine overdose remains elusive. Current protein-based technology offers a new therapeutic venue by which antibodies bind the drug in the blood stream, inactivating its toxic effects. The therapeutic potential of the anticocaine antibody GNC92H2 was examined using a model of cocaine overdose. Swiss albino mice prepared with intrajugular catheters were tested in photocell cages after administration of 93 mg/kg (LD50) of cocaine and GNC92H2 infusions ranging from 30 to 190 mg/kg. GNC92H2 was delivered 30 min before, concomitantly or 3 min after cocaine treatment. Significant blockade of cocaine toxicity was observed with the higher dose of GNC92H2 (190 mg/kg), where premorbid behaviors were reduced up to 40%, seizures up to 77% and death by 72%. Importantly, GNC92H2 prevented death even post-cocaine injection. The results support the important potential of GNC92H2 as a therapeutic tool against cocaine overdose.
The immune dysfunction and cell destruction that occur in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected host appear to result from the direct cytopathic effects of viral infection and the effects of viral proteins on uninfected bystander cells. Recently, the alpha-chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been reported to mediate apoptosis in neuronal cells and in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells after its binding to HIV-1 envelope proteins. In the current study, it was observed that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) undergo apoptosis after their treatment with the HIV-1 envelope proteins gp120/160. Anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody decreased HIV-1 gp120/160-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the CXCR4 chemokine receptor mediates the apoptotic effects of these HIV envelope glycoproteins. Further studies revealed that caspases play an important role in this process because the pretreatment of cells with a general caspase enzyme inhibitor decreased the extent of HUVEC apoptosis induced by gp120/160. In addition, it was found that caspase-3 was activated on HIV-1 gp120/160 treatment of these cells. It was also observed that gp120/160 treatment slightly increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax. These results suggest that HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins can disrupt endothelial integrity through the interaction with CXCR4, thereby facilitating virus transit out of the bloodstream and contributing to the vascular injury syndromes seen in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

The immunoreactive region in a novel autoantigen contains a nuclear localization sequence.
The in vivo characterization of a dual adenosine A(2A)/A(1) receptor antagonist in several animal models of Parkinson's disease is described. Discovery and scale-up syntheses of compound 1 are described in detail, highlighting optimization steps that increased the overall yield of 1 from 10.0% to 30.5%. Compound 1 is a potent A(2A)/A(1) receptor antagonist in vitro (A(2A) K(i) = 4.1 nM; A(1) K(i) = 17.0 nM) that has excellent activity, after oral administration, across a number of animal models of Parkinson's disease including mouse and rat models of haloperidol-induced catalepsy, mouse model of reserpine-induced akinesia, rat 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion model of drug-induced rotation, and MPTP-treated non-human primate model.
The inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene predisposes affected individuals to the human VHL cancer syndrome and is associated with sporadic renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and brain hemangioblastomas. VHL-negative 786-0 RCC cells are tumorigenic in nude mice which is suppressed by the reintroduction of VHL. Remarkably, this occurs without affecting the growth rate and cell cycle profile of these cells in culture. The 786-0 cell line, like many cancer cells, fails to exit the cell cycle upon serum withdrawal. Here, it is shown that reintroduction of the wild-type VHL gene restores the ability of VHL-negative RCC cancer cells to exit the cell cycle and enter G0/quiescence in low serum. Both VHL-positive and VHL-negative RCC cells exit the cell cycle by contact inhibition. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27, accumulates upon serum withdrawal, only in the presence of VHL, as a result of the stabilization of the protein. We propose that the loss of wild-type VHL gene results in a specific cellular defect in serum-dependent growth control, which may initiate tumor formation. This is corrected by the reintroduction of wild-type VHL, implicating VHL as the first tumor suppressor involved in the regulation of cell cycle exit, which is consistent with its gatekeeper function in the kidney..
The incidence of PAX6 mutation in patients with simple aniridia: an evaluation of mutation detection in 12 cases.
The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) was evaluated in 98 patients treated with haloperidol. The incidence of parkinsonism was higher at higher doses of haloperidol and in younger patients. Prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication was effective in younger but not in older patients. However, these medications were more effective in both young and old patients when given after parkinsonism developed. Akathisia was controlled by the benzodiazepine lorazepam in 14 out of 16 patients, while prophylactic antiparkinsonians were ineffective. The present study points to patient characteristics that may be of significance in the development of EPS due to haloperidol.
The incidence of postoperative respiratory apnoea was compared between five patients receiving a continuous i.v. infusion of morphine (mean 73.6 mg) and five patients receiving a continuous extradural infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine (mean 192 mg) in the 24-h period following upper abdominal surgery. Monitoring consisted of airflow detection by a carbon dioxide analyser, chest wall movement detected by pneumatic capsules, and continuous electrocardiograph recorded with a Holter ambulatory monitor. Both obstructive (P less than 0.05) and central apnoea (P less than 0.05) occurred more frequently in patients who had a morphine infusion. There was also a higher incidence of tachyarrhythmias (P less than 0.05) and ventricular ectopic beats (P less than 0.05) in the morphine infusion group.
The inferior colliculus (IC) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information, but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system. Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing, escape-like behavior, and immobility. However, the nature of this immobility is still unclear. The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid-mediated mechanisms in the IC on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically (1 or 0.5 mg/kg) in rats. Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists, MK-801 (15 or 30 mmol/0.5 microl) and AP7 (10 or 20 nmol/0.5 microl), or of the NMDA receptor agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, 20 or 30 nmol/0.5 microl). The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK-801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy, as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar. Accordingly, intracollicular microinjection of NMDA increased the latency to step down the bar. These findings suggest that glutamate-mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence haloperidol-induced catalepsy and participate in the regulation of motor activity.
The infevers autoinflammatory mutation online registry: update with new genes and functions.
The influence of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on cocaine-and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity was examined in mice. All adenosine receptor agonists significantly decreased the locomotor activity in mice, and the effects were dose-dependent. It seems that adenosine A1 and A2 receptors might be involved in this reaction. Moreover, all adenosine receptor agonists: 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS 21680), A2A receptor agonist, N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), A1 receptor agonist, and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), A2/A1 receptor agonist significantly and dose-dependently decreased cocaine-induced locomotor activity. CPA reduced cocaine action at the doses which, given alone, did not influence motility, while CGS 21680 and NECA decreased the action of cocaine at the doses which, given alone, decreased locomotor activity in animals. These results suggest the involvement of both adenosine receptors in the action of cocaine although agonists of A1 receptors seem to have stronger influence on it. The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptor by DMPX (3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine) significantly enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor activity of animals. Caffeine had similar action but the effect was not significant. CPT (8-cyclopentyltheophylline)--A1 receptor antagonist, did not show any influence in this test. Similarly, all adenosine receptor agonists decreased amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, but at the higher doses than those which were active in cocaine-induced hyperactivity. The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptors (DMPX) and non-selective blockade of adenosine receptors (caffeine) significantly increased the action of amphetamine in the locomotor activity test. Our results have shown that all adenosine receptor agonists (A1 and A2) reduce cocaine- and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity and indicate that cocaine-induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists (particularly A1 receptors) than amphetamine-induced hyperactivity.
The influence of d-ribose on adriamycin-induced myocardiopathy in rats was studied. Adriamycin in the cumulative dose of 25 mg/kg evoked fully developed cardiac toxicity. D-ribose in the multiple doses of 200 mg/kg did not influence ADR cardiotoxicity.
The influence of sevoflurane on lidocaine-induced convulsions was studied in cats. The convulsive threshold (mean +/- SD) was 41.4 +/- 6.5 mg. l(-1) with lidocaine infusion (6 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)), increasing significantly to 66.6 +/- 10.9 mg. l(-1) when the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was 0.8%. However, the threshold (61.6 +/- 8.7 mg. l(-1)) during 1.6% sevoflurane was not significant from that during 0.8% sevoflurane, indicating a celling effect. There was no significant difference in the convulsive threshold between sevoflurane and enflurane. The rise in blood pressure became less marked when higher concentrations of sevoflurane or enflurane were administered and the blood pressure at convulsions decreased significantly in 1.6% sevoflurane, and in 0.8% and 1.6% enflurane. However, there was no significant difference in the lidocaine concentrations measured when the systolic blood pressure became 70 mmHg. Apamin, a selective blocker of calcium-dependent potassium channels, was administered intracerebroventricularly in rats anesthetized with 0.8% sevoflurane to investigate the mechanism of the anticonvulsive effects. Apamin (10 ng) had a tendency to decrease the convulsive threshold (21.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.9 +/- 2.5 mg. l(-1)) but this was not statistically significant. It is suggested that sevoflurane reduces the convulsive effect of lidocaine toxicity but carries some risk due to circulatory depression.
The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in mice.
The inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) family of genes has an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating programmed cell death in animals ranging from insects to humans. Ectopic expression of human IAP proteins can suppress cell death induced by a variety of stimuli, but the mechanism of this inhibition was previously unknown. Here we show that human X-chromosome-linked IAP directly inhibits at least two members of the caspase family of cell-death proteases, caspase-3 and caspase-7. As the caspases are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom and are the principal effectors of apoptosis, our findings suggest how IAPs might inhibit cell death, providing evidence for a mechanism of action for these mammalian cell-death suppressors.
The inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) is a pentameric receptor comprised of alpha and beta subunits, of which the beta subunit has not been characterised in humans. A 2106 bp cDNA, isolated from a human hippocampal cDNA library, contained an open reading frame of 497 amino acids which encodes the beta subunit of the human GlyR. The mature human GlyR beta polypeptide displays 99% amino acid identity with the rat GlyR beta subunit and 48% identity with the human GlyR alpha 1 subunit. Neither [3H]strychnine binding nor glycine-gated currents were detected when the human GlyR beta subunit cDNA was expressed in the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line. However, co-expression of the beta subunit cDNA with the alpha 1 subunit cDNA resulted in expression of functional GlyRs which showed a 4-fold reduction in the EC50 values when compared to alpha 1 homomeric GlyRs. Glycine-gated currents of alpha 1/beta GlyRs were 17-fold less sensitive than homomeric alpha 1 GlyRs to the antagonists picrotoxin, picrotoxinin and picrotin, providing clear evidence that heteromeric alpha 1/beta GlyRs were expressed. The beta subunit appears to play a structural rather than ligand binding role in GlyR function. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation was used to localise the gene encoding the human GlyR beta subunit (GLRB) to chromosome 4q32, a position syntenic with mouse chromosome 3. In situ hybridisation using the human GlyR beta subunit cDNA showed that the murine GlyR beta subunit gene (Glrb) maps to the spastic (spa) locus on mouse chromosome 3 at bands E3-F1. This is consistent with the recent finding that a mutation in the murine GlyR beta subunit causes the spa phenotype. It also raises the possibility that mutations in the human beta subunit gene may cause inherited disorders of the startle response.
The initial interaction between B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) appears to be essential for germinal center (GC) formation. To identify molecules regulating this interaction, we generated FDC-staining monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and screened them for their ability to block FDC-mediated costimulation of growth and differentiation of CD40-stimulated B cells. Using one of the inhibitory mAbs, 8D6, we expression cloned the cDNA encoding the 8D6 antigen (Ag) from a human FDC line, HK. The 8D6 Ag is a novel protein of 282 amino acids that is expressed abundantly on FDCs. Monolayers of COS cells transiently transfected with the 8D6 Ag cDNA stimulate B cell growth. The mAb 8D6 blocks the costimulatory function completely. The inhibitory activity of the mAb 8D6 was demonstrated to be due to an inhibition of cell cycle progression of CD40 ligand-stimulated GC B cells. In addition, the mAb 8D6 inhibits the growth of a lymphoma of GC origin, L3055, which depends on FDCs or HK cells for its growth. These findings suggest that the primary function of FDCs in the GC is to stimulate B cell growth. An FDC signal molecule, 8D6 Ag, may be an important molecule to mediate this function.
The insulin receptor related receptor (IRR) is a heterotetrameric transmembrane receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The IRR shares large homology with the insulin and the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) receptor with regard to amino acid sequence and protein structure. So far, only a partial human sequence containing the complete 3' end has been reported, although the full-length human IRR cDNA had been used for transfection studies and functional analysis of the receptor. We have isolated a full-length human IRR cDNA and report on the 5' translated and untranslated region of the human IRR gene. The full length IRR sequence contains 4150 bases and shares a high degree of homology with the guinea pig IRR cDNA sequence and rat IRR sequences that had been reported earlier on by others. Sequencing of the IRR cDNA revealed that the human IRR cDNA contains 341 bases corresponding to the IRR 5' end in addition to the bases that had been reported on before. Also, this sequence contains the start codon of translation. The full length cDNA for the human IRR can now be used for functional expression studies and to elucidate the nature of the ligand for this receptor type.
The interferon regulatory factor 5 gene (IRF5) has been shown to play a crucial role in harmful immune responses by induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Functional genetic variants associated with increased IRF5 expression of specific isoforms are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and it is possible that they may also predispose to other autoimmune disorders. We tested the association of two IRF5 SNPs, correlated with IRF5 expression and SLE risk, in 947 nuclear family trios type 1 diabetes (T1D) using the transmission disequilibrium test. Our results suggest that the functional IRF5 variations do not confer an obvious risk for T1D.
The interpeduncular nucleus regulates nicotine's effects on free-field activity.
The intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species, together with the thioredoxin and glutathione systems, is thought to participate in redox signaling in mammalian cells. The activity of thioredoxin is dependent on the redox status of thioredoxin reductase (TR), the activity of which in turn is dependent on a selenocysteine residue. Two mammalian TR isozymes (TR2 and TR3), in addition to that previously characterized (TR1), have now been identified in humans and mice. All three TR isozymes contain a selenocysteine residue that is located in the penultimate position at the carboxyl terminus and which is encoded by a UGA codon. The generation of reactive oxygen species in a human carcinoma cell line was shown to result in both the oxidation of the selenocysteine in TR1 and a subsequent increase in the expression of this enzyme. These observations identify the carboxyl-terminal selenocysteine of TR1 as a cellular redox sensor and support an essential role for mammalian TR isozymes in redox-regulated cell signaling.
The intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of ouabain (a Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor) in rats has been suggested to mimic some symptoms of human bipolar mania. Clinical studies have shown that bipolar disorder may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Herein, we investigated the behavioral and biochemical effects induced by the ICV administration of ouabain in rats. To achieve this aim, the effects of ouabain injection immediately after and 7 days following a single ICV administration (at concentrations of 10(-2) and 10(-3)M) on locomotion was measured using the open-field test. Additionally, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) and superoxide production were measured in submitochondrial particles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and amygdala. Our findings demonstrated that ouabain at 10(-2) and 10(-3)M induced hyperlocomotion in rats, and this response remained up to 7 days following a single ICV injection. In addition, we observed that the persistent increase in the rat spontaneous locomotion is associated with increased TBARS levels and superoxide generation in submitochondrial particles in the prefrontal cortex, striatum and amygdala. In conclusion, ouabain-induced mania-like behavior may provide a useful animal model to test the hypothesis of the involvement of oxidative stress in bipolar disorder.
The intradermal injection of mu (morphine, Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol and morphiceptin), kappa (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]benzeneactemide) and delta ([D-Pen2.5]-enkephalin and [D-Ser2]-[Leu]enkephalin-Thr) selective opioid-agonists, by themselves, did not significantly affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold in the hindpaw of the rat. Intradermal injection of mu, but not delta or kappa opioid-agonists, however, produced dose-dependent inhibition of prostaglandin E2-induced hyperalgesia. The analgesic effect of the mu-agonist morphine was dose-dependently antagonized by naloxone and prevented by co-injection of pertussis toxin. Morphine did not, however, alter the hyperalgesia induced by 8-bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate. We conclude that the analgesic action of opioids on the peripheral terminals of primary afferents is via a binding site with characteristics of the mu-opioid receptor and that this action is mediated by inhibition of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate second messenger system.
The introduction of drugs that could induce hypotension with different pharmacological actions would be advantageous because side effects unique to a specific drug could be minimized by selecting appropriate therapy. Specific dopamine-1, (DA1) and dopamine-2 (DA2) receptor agonists are now under clinical investigation. Fenoldopam mesylate is a specific DA1 receptor agonist that lowers blood pressure by vasodilatation. The hypothesis that fenoldopam could be used to induce hypotension and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested. Systemic aortic blood pressure and renal blood flow were measured continuously with a carotid arterial catheter and an electromagnetic flow probe respectively, in order to compare the cardiovascular and renal vascular effects of fenoldopam and sodium nitroprusside in ten dogs under halothane general anaesthesia. Mean arterial pressure was decreased 30 +/- 8 per cent from control with infusion of fenoldopam (3.4 +/- 2.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and 34 +/- 4 per cent with infusion of sodium nitroprusside (5.9 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) (NS). Renal blood flow (RBF) increased during fenoldopam-induced hypotension 11 +/- 7 per cent and decreased 21 +/- 8 per cent during sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension (P less than 0.01). Sodium nitroprusside is a non-selective arteriolar and venous vasodilator that can produce redistribution of blood flow away from the kidney during induced hypotension. Fenoldopam is a selective dopamine-1 (DA1) receptor agonist that causes vasodilatation to the kidney and other organs with DA1 receptors and preserves blood flow to the kidney during induced hypotension.
The intron 7 donor splice site transition: a second Tay-Sachs disease mutation in French Canada.
The known Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene products, the muscle- and brain-type dystrophin isoforms, are 427-kDa proteins translated from 14-kilobase (kb) mRNAs. Recently we described a 6. 5-kb mRNA that also is transcribed from the DMD gene. Cloning and in vitro transcription and translation of the entire coding region show that the 6. 5-kb mRNA encodes a 70. 8-kDa protein that is a major product of the DMD gene. It contains the C-terminal and the cysteine-rich domains of dystrophin, seven additional amino acids at the N terminus, and some modifications formed by alternative splicing in the C-terminal domain. It lacks the entire large domain of spectrin-like repeats and the actin-binding N-terminal domain of dystrophin. This protein is the major DMD gene product in brain and other nonmuscle tissues but is undetectable in skeletal muscle extracts.
The localization of proteolytic enzymes at the cell surface is a widely used strategy for facilitating tumor invasion. In this study, we have cloned a new member of the membrane-type subfamily of matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs), a group of enzymes associated with tumor progression. The cloned cDNA encodes a protein of 562 amino acids with a domain organization similar to that of other MT-MMPs, including a prodomain with a cysteine switch, a catalytic domain with the zinc-binding site, a hemopexin-like domain, and a COOH-terminal extension rich in hydrophobic residues. The predicted protein sequence also contains a short insertion of basic residues located between the propeptide and the catalytic domain and involved in the proteolytic activation of MT-MMPs by furin-like enzymes. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of COS-7 cells transfected with the isolated cDNA revealed that the encoded protein is localized at the cell surface. Based on these properties, this novel human matrix metalloproteinase has been called MT6-MMP because it is the sixth identified member of this subfamily of matrix metalloproteinase. Cotransfection of expression plasmids encoding MT6-MMP and progelatinase A resulted in activation of COS-7-secreted progelatinase A, as demonstrated by gelatin zymography. In contrast, transfection of progelatinase A cDNA alone did not lead to the activation of the proenzyme. Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNAs isolated from human tissues demonstrated that MT6-MMP is predominantly expressed in leukocytes, lung, and spleen. MT6-MMP was also detected at high levels in SW480 colon carcinoma cells as well as in some anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas, but not in normal colon or brain or in meningiomas. On the basis of these results, we propose that MT6-MMP may facilitate tumor progression through its ability to activate progelatinase A at the membrane of cells from colon carcinomas or brain tumors.
The locus for Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), a severe neurodegenerative disease, is tightly linked to markers D9S5 and D9S15, and analysis of rare recombination events has suggested the order cen-FRDA-D9S5-D9S15-qter. We report here the construction of a YAC contig extending 800 kb centromeric to D9S5 and the isolation of five new microsatellite markers from this region. In order to map these markers with respect to the FRDA locus, all within a 1-cM confidence interval, we sought to increase the genetic information of available FRDA families by considering homozygosity by descent and association with founder haplotypes in isolated populations. This approach allowed us to identify one phase-known recombination and one probable historic recombination on haplotypes from Reunion Island patients, both of which place three of the five markers proximal to FRDA. This represents the first identification of close FRDA flanking markers on the centromeric side. The two other markers allowed us to narrow the breakpoint of a previously identified distal recombination that is > 180 kb from D9S5 (26P). Taken together, the results place the FRDA locus in a 450-kb interval, which is small enough for direct search of candidate genes. A detailed rare cutter restriction map and a cosmid contig covering this interval were constructed and should facilitate the search of genes in this region..
The locus for the incomplete form of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2) maps to a 1.1-Mb region in Xp11.23 between markers DXS722 and DXS255. We identified a retina-specific calcium channel alpha1-subunit gene (CACNA1F) in this region, consisting of 48 exons encoding 1966 amino acids and showing high homology to L-type calcium channel alpha1-subunits. Mutation analysis in 13 families with CSNB2 revealed nine different mutations in 10 families, including three nonsense and one frameshift mutation. These data indicate that aberrations in a voltage-gated calcium channel, presumably causing a decrease in neurotransmitter release from photoreceptor presynaptic terminals, are a frequent cause of CSNB2.
The long-term safety of danazol in women with hereditary angioedema.
The long-term use of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (ND-NMBA) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged muscle weakness, although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear. We report 3 patients (age 37-52 years) with acute respiratory insufficiency who developed prolonged weakness following the discontinuation of ND-NMBAs. Two patients also received intravenous corticosteroids. Renal function was normal but hepatic function was impaired in all patients, and all had acidosis. Electrophysiologic studies revealed low amplitude compound motor action potentials, normal sensory studies, and fibrillations. Repetitive stimulation at 2 Hz showed a decremental response in 2 patients. The serum vecuronium level measured in 1 patient 14 days after the drug had been discontinued was 172 ng/mL. A muscle biopsy in this patient showed loss of thick, myosin filaments. The weakness in these patients is due to pathology at both the neuromuscular junction (most likely due to ND-NMBA) and muscle (most likely due to corticosteroids). Hepatic dysfunction and acidosis are contributing risk factors.
The low abundance fibrillar collagen type V is widely distributed in tissues as an alpha1(V)(2)alpha2(V) heterotrimer that helps regulate the diameters of fibrils of the abundant collagen type I. Mutations in the alpha1(V) and alpha2(V) chain genes have been identified in some cases of classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), in which aberrant collagen fibrils are associated with connective tissue fragility, particularly in skin and joints. Type V collagen also exists as an alpha1(V)alpha2(V)alpha3(V) heterotrimer that has remained poorly characterized chiefly due to inability to obtain the complete primary structure or nucleic acid probes for the alpha3(V) chain or its biosynthetic precursor, pro-alpha3(V). Here we provide human and mouse full-length pro-alpha3(V) sequences. Pro-alpha3(V) is shown to be closely related to the alpha1(V) precursor, pro-alpha1(V), but with marked differences in N-propeptide sequences, and collagenous domain features that provide insights into the low melting temperature of alpha1(V)alpha2(V)alpha3(V) heterotrimers, lack of heparin binding by alpha3(V) chains and the possibility that alpha1(V)alpha2(V)alpha3(V) heterotrimers are incorporated into heterotypic fibrils. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos detects alpha3(V) expression primarily in the epimysial sheaths of developing muscles and within nascent ligaments adjacent to forming bones and in joints. This distribution, and the association of alpha1(V), alpha2(V), and alpha3(V) chains in heterotrimers, suggests the human alpha3(V) gene COL5A3 as a candidate locus for at least some cases of classical EDS in which the alpha1(V) and alpha2(V) genes have been excluded, and for at least some cases of the hypermobility type of EDS, a condition marked by gross joint laxity and chronic musculoskeletal pain. COL5A3 is mapped to 19p13.2 near a polymorphic marker that should be useful in analyzing linkage with EDS and other disease phenotypes.
The lubricating properties of human submandibular-sublingual salivary fractions were examined using a servohydraulic model of mandibular movement. Fractions containing statherin exhibited a strong tendency to boundary lubrication. The lubricity of purified statherin was confirmed and compared to the amphipathic molecules gramacidin S and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Contact angle measurements of statherin paralleled the other amphipathic molecules. The helical content of statherin increased in trifluoroethanol indicating the presence of amphipathic helical regions. CD studies and hydrophobic moment calculations indicated that statherin adopts an amphipathic helical conformation at the N-terminus. An energy-minimized model of the polar N-terminal residues 1-15 suggested that this domain could be positioned in space to interact with a hydroxyapatite substrate. These data imply that under appropriate conditions statherin may display an amphipathic nature which enables it to function as a boundary lubricant on enamel.
The mAb L10 was used to determine the distribution and the function of sialophorin, the heavily glycosylated surface molecule that is deficient/defective in lymphocytes of patients with the X-linked immunodeficiency Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Dual-parameter FACS analysis indicated that sialophorin is expressed on CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocytes, on a subpopulation of peripheral blood B lymphocytes, on all thymocytes, and on a subpopulation of bone marrow cells. Functional studies demonstrated that L10 mAb stimulates the proliferation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes as measured by stimulation of [3H] thymidine incorporation. The time course and magnitude of increased [3H] thymidine incorporation by T lymphocytes in response to L10 mAb paralleled that induced by anti-CD3 mAb. Effective stimulation was dependent on the presence of monocytes and the Fc portion of L10 mAb. Stimulation of lymphocytes by L10, like stimulation by anti-CD3 mAb, involves increased expression of 4F2, HLA-DR, and IL-2-R. These observations suggest that sialophorin functions in T cell activation..
The majority of constitutional reciprocal translocations appear to be unique rearrangements arising from independent events. However, a small number of translocations are recurrent, most significantly the t(11;22)(q23;q11). Among large series of translocations there may be multiple independently ascertained cases with the same cytogenetic breakpoints. Some of these could represent additional recurrent rearrangements, alternatively they could be identical by descent (IBD) or have subtly different breakpoints when examined under higher resolution. We have used molecular breakpoint mapping and haplotyping to determine the origin of three pairs of reciprocal constitutional translocations, each with the same cytogenetic breakpoints. FISH mapping showed one pair to have different breakpoints and thus to be distinct rearrangements. Another pair of translocations were IBD with identical breakpoint intervals and highly conserved haplotypes on the derived chromosomes. The third pair, t(4;11)(p16.2;p15.4), had the same breakpoint intervals by aCGH and fosmid mapping but had very different haplotypes, therefore they represent a novel recurrent translocation. Unlike the t(11;22)(q23;q11), the formation of the t(4;11)(p16.2;p15.4) may have involved segmental duplications and sequence homology at the breakpoints. Additional examples of recurrent translocations could be identified if the resources were available to study more translocations using the approaches described here. However, like the t(4;11)(p16.2;p15.4), such translocations are likely to be rare with the t(11;22) remaining the only common recurrent constitutional reciprocal translocation.
The mapping of a cDNA from the human X-linked Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene to the mouse X chromosome.
The marked vasodilator and negative inotropic effects of propofol are disadvantages in frail elderly patients. We investigated the safety and efficacy of adding different doses of ephedrine to propofol in order to obtund the hypotensive response. The haemodynamic effects of adding 15, 20 or 25 mg of ephedrine to 200 mg of propofol were compared to control in 40 ASA 3/4 patients over 60 years presenting for genito-urinary surgery. The addition of ephedrine to propofol appears to be an effective method of obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol at all doses used in this study. However, marked tachycardia associated with the use of ephedrine in combination with propofol occurred in the majority of patients, occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients. Due to the risk of this tachycardia inducing myocardial ischemia, we would not recommend the use in elderly patients of any of the ephedrine/propofol/mixtures studied.
The mechanism by which (CTG) n expansion in the 3 UTR of the DMPK gene causes myotonic dystrophy (DM) is unknown. We identified four RNA splicing factors--hnRNP C, U2AF (U2 auxiliary factor), PTB (polypyrimidine tract binding protein), and PSF (PTB associated splicing factor) --that bind to two short regions 3 of the (CUG) n, and found a novel 3 DMPK exon resulting in an mRNA lacking the repeats. We propose that the (CUG) n is an essential cis acting element for this splicing event. In contrast to (CUG) n containing mRNAs, the novel isoform is not retained in the nucleus in DM cells, resulting in imbalances in relative levels of cytoplasmic DMPK mRNA isoforms and a new dominant effect of the mutation on DMPK..
The mechanism by which the Parkinson's disease-related protein alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) causes neurodegeneration has not been elucidated. To determine the genes that protect cells from alpha-syn, we used a genetic screen to identify suppressors of the super sensitivity of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing alpha-syn to killing by hydrogen peroxide. Forty genes in ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism, protein biosynthesis, vesicle trafficking and the response to stress were identified. Five of the forty genes--ENT3, IDP3, JEM1, ARG2 and HSP82--ranked highest in their ability to block alpha-syn-induced reactive oxygen species accumulation, and these five genes were characterized in more detail. The deletion of any of these five genes enhanced the toxicity of alpha-syn as judged by growth defects compared with wild-type cells expressing alpha-syn, which indicates that these genes protect cells from alpha-syn. Strikingly, four of the five genes are specific for alpha-syn in that they fail to protect cells from the toxicity of the two inherited mutants A30P or A53T. This finding suggests that alpha-syn causes toxicity to cells through a different pathway than these two inherited mutants. Lastly, overexpression of Ent3p, which is a clathrin adapter protein involved in protein transport between the Golgi and the vacuole, causes alpha-syn to redistribute from the plasma membrane into cytoplasmic vesicular structures. Our interpretation is that Ent3p mediates the transport of alpha-syn to the vacuole for proteolytic degradation. A similar clathrin adaptor protein, epsinR, exists in humans.
The mechanism of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity remains controversial. Wistar rats (n = 66) received DOX injections intraperitoneally and were randomly assigned to 2 experimental protocols: (1) rats were killed before (-24 h, n = 8) and 24 h after (+24 h, n = 8) a single dose of DOX (4 mg/kg body weight) to determine the DOX acute effect and (2) rats (n = 58) received 4 injections of DOX (4 mg/kg body weight/week) and were killed before the first injection (M0) and 1 week after each injection (M1, M2, M3, and M4) to determine the chronological effects. Animals used at M0 (n = 8) were also used at moment -24 h of acute study. Cardiac total antioxidant performance (TAP), DNA damage, and morphology analyses were carried out at each time point. Single dose of DOX was associated with increased cardiac disarrangement, necrosis, and DNA damage (strand breaks (SBs) and oxidized pyrimidines) and decreased TAP. The chronological study showed an effect of a cumulative dose on body weight (R = -0.99, p = 0.011), necrosis (R = 1.00, p = 0.004), TAP (R = 0.95, p = 0.049), and DNA SBs (R = -0.95, p = 0.049). DNA SBs damage was negatively associated with TAP (R = -0.98, p = 0.018), and necrosis (R = -0.97, p = 0.027). Our results suggest that oxidative damage is associated with acute cardiotoxicity induced by a single dose of DOX only. Increased resistance to the oxidative stress is plausible for the multiple dose of DOX. Thus, different mechanisms may be involved in acute toxicity versus chronic toxicity.
The mechanism of isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage is unknown, but a mismatch of oxygen supply vs. demand following coronary hypotension and myocardial hyperactivity is the best explanation for the complex morphological alterations observed. Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes have been demonstrated to be caused by isoproterenol. Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins, this study tests the hypothesis that isoproterenol affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins. We found different sensitivity of the DGC and integrin to isoproterenol subcutaneous administration. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin. Subsequently, after lysis of myofilaments, gamma-sarcoglycan, beta-dystroglycan, beta1-integrin, and laminin alpha-2 expressions were reduced followed by their breakdown, as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process. In conclusion, administration of isoproterenol to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin, the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte. These changes, related to ischaemic injury, explain the severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes and hence severe and irreversible injury induced by isoproterenol.
The metabolism of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol is under genetic control of the debrisoquine/sparteine type. The two metabolic phenotypes, extensive (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM), show different stereoselective metabolism, resulting in apparently higher beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of racemic metoprolol in EMs. We investigated if the latter also applies to the beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonism by metoprolol. The drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S-isomer, were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC50 values, representing metoprolol plasma concentrations resulting in half-maximum receptor occupancy. Six EMs received 0.5 mg of terbutaline s.c. on two different occasions: 1) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o. Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol, except for a higher terbutaline dose (0.75 mg) on day 2. Blood samples for the analysis of plasma potassium, terbutaline, metoprolol (racemic, R- and S-isomer), and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular time intervals, during 8 hr after metoprolol. In PMs, metoprolol increased the terbutaline area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (+67%). Higher metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R-/S-isomer ratios of unchanged drug. There was a difference in metoprolol potency with higher racemic metoprolol IC50 values in PMs (72 +/- 7 ng.ml-1) than EMs (42 +/- 8 ng.ml-1, P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The mitochondrial carriers are a family of transport proteins in the inner membranes of mitochondria. They shuttle substrates, metabolites, and cofactors through this membrane and connect cytoplasm functions with others in the matrix. Glutamate is co-transported with H(+) (or exchanged for OH(-)), but no protein has ever been associated with this activity. Two human expressed sequence tags encode proteins of 323 and 315 amino acids with 63% identity that are related to the aspartate-glutamate carrier, a member of the carrier family. They have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. Their transport properties demonstrate that the two proteins are isoforms of the glutamate/H(+) symporter described in the past in whole mitochondria. Isoform 1 is expressed at higher levels than isoform 2 in all the tissues except in brain, where the two isoforms are expressed at comparable levels. The differences in expression levels and kinetic parameters of the two isoforms suggest that isoform 2 matches the basic requirement of all tissues especially with respect to amino acid degradation, and isoform 1 becomes operative to accommodate higher demands associated with specific metabolic functions such as ureogenesis.
The molecular basis of C6 deficiency in the western Cape, South Africa.
The molecular basis of C7 deficiency has been investigated in two Irish families and a number of Israeli families of Moroccan Sephardic Jewish origin. Exon PCR and sequencing revealed a heterozygous point mutation at the 3 splice acceptor site of intron 1 in one Irish family. In the other Irish family, exons 7 and 8 failed to amplify and they were shown to be deleted. Marker haplotype studies of the C6 and C7 gene region and Southern blots show that the Irish family with the splice defect also segregate for the deletion, which is not easily detected in heterozygotes. The Israeli C7-deficient cases all share a C7 haplotype and are homozygous for a mis-sense mutation in exon 9. However, one individual is heterozygous for markers at adjacent C6 loci, showing that there has been an intergenic recombination and suggesting that the deficiency mutation is of appreciable antiquity..
The molecular basis of Sjogren-Larsson syndrome: mutation analysis of the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase gene.
The molecular basis of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) deficiency was investigated in 4 unrelated CETP-deficient families. The high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels of the probands exceeded 150 mg/dl. The plasma of the probands was totally deficient in CETP activity and mass. The genomic DNA of the patients was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using two oligonucleotide primers located in the intron 12 and 14 of the CETP gene, and the amplified products were directly sequenced. Two patients were homozygous for a G-to-A change at the 5-splice donor site of the intron 14. The G-to-A change would cause impaired splicing of pre-messenger RNA. The other two probands were heterozygous for the mutation, but totally lacked CETP. Their lipoprotein patterns were also similar to those of the two homozygotes. Thus, other genetic defects or metabolic factors influencing CETP expression are implicated. The data suggest that the G-to-A mutation may be common in human plasma CETP deficiency. Furthermore, there could be compound heterozygotes who totally lack plasma CETP and have lipoprotein profiles similar to those of homozygotes..
The molecular genetic basis of the P histo-blood group system has eluded characterization despite extensive studies of the biosynthesis of the P(1), P, and P(k) glycolipids. The main controversy has been whether a single or two distinct UDP-Gal:Galbeta1-R 4-alpha-galactosyltransferases catalyze the syntheses of the structurally related P(1) and P(k) antigens. The P(1) polymorphism is linked to 22q11.3-ter. Data base searches with the coding region of an alpha4GlcNAc-transferase identified a novel homologous gene at 22q13.2 designated alpha4Gal-T1. Expression of full coding constructs of alpha4Gal-T1 in insect cells revealed it encoded P(k) but not P(1) synthase activity. Northern analysis showed expression of the transcript correlating with P(k) synthase activity and antigen expression in human B cell lines. Transfection of P(k)-negative Namalwa cells with alpha4Gal-T1 resulted in strong P(k) expression. A single homozygous missense mutation, M183K, was found in six Swedish individuals of the rare p phenotype, confirming that alpha4Gal-T1 represented the P(k) gene. Sequence analysis of the coding region of alpha4Gal-T1 in P(1)+/- individuals did not reveal polymorphisms correlating with P(1)P(2) typing.
The molecular mechanisms underlying the internalization of G protein-coupled receptors are still poorly understood. Normally agonists but not antagonists cause internalization (defined here as a reduction in the number of receptors at the cell surface), suggesting a functional relationship between agonist activity and internalization. In this study we investigated the effects of eight muscarinic ligands on the rate constants for endocytosis and recycling of m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We found that there was a linear correlation between the intrinsic activity of the ligand and its ability to increase the rate constant for endocytosis, suggesting that the same active conformation of the receptor is responsible for stimulating both second messenger generation and receptor endocytosis. In contrast, the rate constant for recycling did not depend on which agonist had triggered receptor endocytosis, suggesting that recycling is a purely constitutive process. Because receptor internalization depends on the rate constants for both endocytosis and recycling, the relationship between internalization and intrinsic activity is nonlinear. In particular, mathematical modeling of receptor trafficking revealed that under certain conditions very small (3% or less) increases in the rate constant for endocytosis are sufficient to cause substantial receptor internalization. An important implication of this analysis is that extremely weak partial agonists (which may in practice be indistinguishable from antagonists) may produce significant receptor internalization.
The morbidity and mortality associated with heparin-induced thrombosis remain high despite numerous empirical therapies. Ancrod has been used successfully for prophylaxis against development of thrombosis in patients with heparin induced platelet aggregation who require brief reexposure to heparin, but its success in patients who have developed the thrombosis syndrome is not well defined. The authors present a case of failure of ancrod treatment in a patient with heparin-induced thrombosis.
The most severe adverse reactions to carbamazepine have been observed in the haemopoietic system, the liver and the cardiovascular system. A frequently fatal, although exceptionally rare side effect of carbamazepine is necrotizing eosinophilic (hypersensitivity) myocarditis. We report a case of hypersensitivity myocarditis secondary to administration of carbamazepine. Acute hypersensitivity myocarditis was not suspected clinically, and the diagnosis was made post-mortem. Histology revealed diffuse infiltration of the myocardium by eosinophils and lymphocytes with myocyte damage. Clinically, death was due to cardiogenic shock. To best of our knowledge this is the second case of fatal carbamazepine induced myocarditis reported in English literature.
The motility of gastrointestinal tract is regulated by classical neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and humoral agents. Two novel human cDNAs have been cloned based on their sequence similarity to a frog skin secretion protein, Bv8, and a nontoxic protein of mamba snake venom. These human cDNAs encode two secreted proteins of 86 and 81 amino acids. Northern blot hybridization has revealed that these cDNAs are expressed in gastrointestinal tract, particularly the stomach. Recombinant proteins with authentic N-terminal sequences have been produced in Escherichia coli and refolded into functional proteins by careful control of protein aggregation. Mass spectrometry has confirmed the formation of five pairs of disulfide bonds. The refolded recombinant proteins potently contract gastrointestinal smooth muscle with EC(50) values in the subnanomolar range. The contractile effects of the recombinant proteins are specific for gastrointestinal smooth muscle, because they have no effect on vascular or respiratory smooth muscle. To reflect their potent and specific effects on gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells, we have named these recombinant proteins prokineticins. Ligand binding studies with iodinated prokineticin revealed the presence of a high-affinity site in ileal smooth muscle. The displacement of specific binding by GTP gamma S suggests that the prokineticin receptor may belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. Experiments with verapamil and nifedipine revealed that calcium influx is essential for the contractile activity of prokineticins on gastrointestinal smooth muscle. In summary, we have identified two novel endogenous regulators of gastrointestinal motility. The availability of recombinant prokineticins should provide novel therapeutic agents for disorders involving impaired gastrointestinal motility.
The mouse BCM1 (OX45, Blast-1) antigen has been cDNA cloned and sequenced to provide data supporting the view that BCM1, LFA3, and CD2 constitute a subgroup within the Ig superfamily. Mouse BCM1 is widely expressed on leukocytes and is likely to be anchored to the cell surface by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor, as is the case for rat and human BCM1 antigen. Genetic linkage studies by recombination and pulse field analysis showed the BCM1 locus (Bcm-1) to be on distal mouse chromosome 1 and to be linked within 1,600 kb to the locus for an ATPase alpha chain gene (Atpa-3). A similar relationship was established between the human BCM1 locus (BCM1) and ATP1A2, and other markers on chromosome 1q. Conservation of genomic organization within a segment of human chromosome 1q and mouse chromosome 1 was demonstrated. A similar situation is seen in the region of the CD2 and LFA3 genes between mouse chromosome 3 and human chromosome 1p. Furthermore, the CD2/LFA3 genes are linked within 580 kb to Atpa-1/ATP1A1 genes to provide a parallel situation to the linkage between Bcm-1/BCM1 and Atpa-3/ATP1A2 on chromosomes 1 (mouse) and 1q (human). Taken together, the data suggest duplication of a chromosome region including the precursors of the genes for BCM1, CD2, and LFA3, and the ATPase genes to give rise to the linkage groups now observed. The duplicated regions may have stayed together on chromosome 1 in the human (with the insertion of a centromere), while in the mouse, the genetic regions are proposed to have become dispersed in the formation of chromosomes 1 and 3. CD2 and LFA3 are more dissimilar in sequence than BCM1 and LFA3, and if the precursors of the CD2 and LFA3 loci formed before the proposed chromosome segment duplication, then a gene encoding a recognizer molecule for BCM1 may exist in linkage with Bcm-1/BCM1 on chromosome 1 (mouse) and 1q (human).
The mouse WASP gene, the homolog of the gene mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, has been isolated and sequenced. the predicted amino acid sequence is 86% identical to the human WASP sequence. A distinct feature of the mouse gene is an expanded polymorphic GGA trinucleotide repeat that codes for polyglycine and varies from 15 to 17 triplets in different Mus musculus strains. The genomic structure of the mouse WASP gene is expressed as an approximately 2. 4-kb mRNA in thymus and spleen. Chromosomal mapping in an interspecific M. Musculus/M. spretus backcross placed the Wasp locus near the centromere of the mouse X chromosome, inseparable from Gata1, Tcfe3, and scurfy (sf). This localization makes Wasp a candidate for involvement in scurfy, a T cell-mediated fatal lymphoreticular disease of mice that has previously been proposed as a mouse homolog of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Northern analysis of sf tissue samples indicated the presence of WASP mRNA in liver and skin, presumably as a consequence of lymphocytic infiltration, but non abnormalities in the amount or size of mRNA present.
The mouse homolog of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) gene is highly conserved and maps near the scurfy (sf) mutation on the X chromosome.
The movement disorder investigated in these studies has some features in common with human idiopathic dystonia, and information obtained in these studies may be of potential clinical benefit. The present experimental results indicated that peptidergic stimulation of the LC resulted in a NE-mediated inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje cells located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway. However, it is not certain as to the following: (a) what receptors were stimulated by the ACTH N-terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder; (b) whether NE, released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway, did indeed cause the long-term depression at Purkinje cell synapses (previously described by others) that resulted in the long duration of the movement disorder; (c) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei, the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons, that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder. These questions are currently being investigated.
The multiprotein Mediator complex is a coactivator required for transcriptional activation of RNA polymerase II transcribed genes by DNA binding transcription factors. We previously partially purified a Med8-containing Mediator complex from rat liver nuclei (Brower, C. S., Sato, S., Tomomori-Sato, C., Kamura, T., Pause, A., Stearman, R., Klausner, R. D., Malik, S., Lane, W. S., Sorokina, I., Roeder, R. G., Conaway, J. W., and Conaway, R. C. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 10353-10358). Analysis of proteins present in the most highly enriched Mediator fractions by tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification of several new mammalian Mediator subunits, as well as several potential Mediator subunits. Here we identify one of these proteins, encoded by the previously uncharacterized AK000411 open reading frame, as a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. The AK000411 protein, which we designate hIntersex (human Intersex), shares significant sequence similarity with the Drosophila melanogaster intersex protein, which has functional properties expected of a transcriptional coactivator specific for the Drosophila doublesex transactivator. In addition, we show that hIntersex assembles into a subcomplex with Mediator subunits p28b and TRFP. Taken together, our findings identify a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator and shed new light on the architecture of the mammalian Mediator complex.
The murine homolog of the human breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene Brca1 maps to mouse chromosome 11D.
The murine homologues of the Huntington disease gene (Hdh) and the alpha-adducin gene (Add1) map to mouse chromosome 5 within a region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 4p16.3.
The muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine induces in rats seizures and status epilepticus followed by widespread damage to the forebrain. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of 5 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sodium salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, ibuprofen and mefenamic acid, on seizures produced by pilocarpine. Pretreatment of rats with sodium salicylate, ED50 103 mg/kg (60-174), and phenylbutazone, 59 mg/kg (50-70) converted the non-convulsant dose of pilocarpine, 200 mg/kg, to a convulsant one. Indomethacin, 1-10 mg/kg, and ibuprofen, 10-100 mg/kg, failed to modulate seizures produced by pilocarpine. Mefenamic acid, 26 (22-30) mg/kg, prevented seizures and protected rats from seizure-related brain damage induced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. These results indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs differentially modulate the threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures.
The mutation causing juvenile Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) in two sibs of Lebanese-Maronite origin is described. An mRNA-containing extract of cultured fibroblasts obtained from one of the probands was used as a template to amplify the coding sequence of the hexosaminidase A (Hex A) alpha-subunit. Sequencing of amplified cDNA fragments revealed a single alteration, guanine to adenine at nt 749 creating a G250D mutation. The mutation introduces a new recognition site for the restriction enzyme Eco RV, permitting identification of heterozygotes for this allele following PCR amplification and Eco RV digestion of exon 7 sequences from genomic DNA templates. In order to test the effect of this substitution, an in vitro mutagenized cDNA construct was introduced into a mammalian expression vector and transfected into monkey Cos-1 cells separately or along with a beta-cDNA expression vector. When the mutant alpha-cDNA was the only gene introduced into COS cells no enzymatic activity above endogenous COS cell activity was detected. Cotransfection of normal alpha-cDNA and beta-cDNA followed by immunoprecipitation of human Hex A resulted in 20-fold increase in the ratio between positive and negative (mock transfection) control values. This allowed the detection of some residual activity (12% of the positive control) when the mutant alpha-cDNA replaced its wild-type counterpart. The predicted protein environment in which the mutation occurs is compared to that of the adult-onset Tay-Sachs disease mutation caused by a Gly269-- > Ser substitution in exon 7.

The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy (DM) has been identified as a CTG expansion in the 3-untranslated region (3-UTR) of the DM protein kinase gene (DMPK), but the mechanism (s) of pathogenesis remain unknown. Studies using DM patient materials have often produced confusing results. Therefore, to study the effects of the DM mutation in a controlled environment, we have established a cell culture model system using C2C12 mouse myoblasts. By expressing chimeric reporter constructs containing a reporter gene fused to a human DMPK 3-UTR, we identified both cis and trans effects that are mediated by the DM mutation. Our data show that a mutant DMPK 3-UTR, with as few as 57 CTGs, had a negative cis effect on protein expression and resulted in the aggregation of reporter transcripts into discrete nuclear foci. We determined by deletion analysis that an expanded (CTG) (n) tract alone was sufficient to mediate these cis effects. Furthermore, in contrast to the normal DMPK 3-UTR mRNA, a mutant DMPK 3-UTR mRNA with (CUG) (200) selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Genetic analysis and the Cre- loxP system were used to clearly demonstrate that the myoblast fusion defect could be rescued by eliminating the expression of the mutant DMPK 3-UTR transcript. Characterization of spontaneous deletion events mapped the inhibitory effect to the (CTG) (n) expansion and/or the 3 end of the DMPK 3-UTR. These results provide evidence that the DM mutation acts in cis to reduce protein production (consistent with DMPK haploinsufficiency) and in trans as a riboregulator to inhibit myogenesis..
The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy (DM) has been identified as an amplification of an unstable trinucleotide (CTG) n repeat in over 99% of the global DM population. It is in complete linkage disequilibrium with an Alu element polymorphism within the DM kinase gene, suggesting that DM is a consequence of one or few ancestral mutations. A recent analysis utilizing this polymorphism as well as a flanking dinucleotide marker, suggested that similar to Fragile X syndrome, DM exhibited a founder effect (Imbert et al., 1993 Nature Genet. 4, 72-76). In contrast, the low reproductive fitness of individuals with congenital DM (the endpoint of genetic anticipation in myotonic dystrophy) suggests a higher rate of new mutations. We present a high resolution genetic analysis of the DM locus using PCR based assays of nine polymorphisms, spanning a physical distance of 30 kb, within and immediately flanking the DM kinase gene. The persistent complete allelic association of the DM mutation with all these polymorphisms provides further support to previous observations and suggests more strongly that the DM mutation occurred on the background of a particular haplotype in which the (CTG) n repeat became inherently unstable and therefore predisposed to amplification.
The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy (DM) has recently been identified as an unstable CTG trinucleotide repeat located in the 3 untranslated region of a gene encoding for a protein with putative serine-threonine protein kinase activity. In this report we present the genomic sequences of the human and murine DM kinase gene. A comparison of these sequences with each other and with known cDNA sequences from both species, led us to predict a translation initiation codon, as well as determine the organization of the DM kinase gene. Several polymorphisms within the human DM kinase gene have been identified, and PCR assays to detect two of these are described. The complete sequence and characterization of the structure of the DM kinase gene, as well as the identification of novel polymorphisms within the gene, represent an important step in a further understanding of the genetics of myotonic dystrophy and the molecular biology of the gene..
The mutation underlying Huntington disease (HD) is CAG expansion in the first exon of the HD gene. In order to investigate the role of CAG expansion in the pathogenesis of HD, we have produced transgenic mice containing the full length human HD cDNA with 44 CAG repeats. By 1 year, these mice have no behavioral abnormalities and morphometric analysis at 6 (one animal) and 9 (two animals) months age revealed no changes. Despite high levels of mRNA expression, there was no evidence of the HD gene product in any of these transgenic mice. In vitro transfection studies indicated that the inclusion of 120 bp of the 5 UTR in the cDNA construct and the presence of a frameshift mutation at nucleotide 2349 prevented expression of the HD cDNA. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of HD is not mediated through DNA-protein interaction and that presence of the RNA transcript with an expanded CAG repeat is insufficient to cause the disease. Rather, translation of the CAG is crucial for the pathogenesis of HD. In contrast to that seen in humans, the CAG repeat in these mice was remarkably stable in 97 meioses. This suggests that genomic sequences may play a critical role in influencing repeat instability..
The mutation underlying myotonic dystrophy (DM) has been identified as an expansion of a polymorphic CTG-repeat in a gene encoding protein kinase activity. Brain and heart transcripts of the DM-kinase (DMR-B15) gene are subject to alternative RNA splicing in both human and mouse. The unstable [CTG] 5-30 motif is found uniquely in humans, although the flanking nucleotides are also present in mouse. Characterization of the DM region of both species reveals another active gene (DMR-N9) in close proximity to the kinase gene. DMR-N9 transcripts, mainly expressed in brain and testis, possess a single, large open reading frame, but the function of its protein product is unknown. Clinical manifestation of DM may be caused by the expanded CTG-repeat compromising the (alternative) expression of DM-kinase or DMR-N9 proteins..
The myb gene is the transforming oncogene of the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV); its normal cellular homolog, c-myb, is conserved across a broad span of evolution. In humans, c-myb is expressed in malignant hematopoietic cell lines and in primary hematopoietic tumors. Partial complementary DNA clones were generated from blast cells of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. The sequences of the clones were compared to the c-myb of other species, as well as the v-myb of AMV. In addition, the carboxyl terminal region of human c-myb was placed in an expression vector to obtain protein for the generation of antiserum, which was used to identify the human c-myb gene product. Like v-myb, this protein was found within the nucleus of leukemic cells where it was associated with the nuclear matrix. These studies provide further evidence that c-myb might be involved in human leukemia.
The myotonic dystrophy (DM) mutation is an unstable (CTG) n repeat, present at a copy number of 5-37 repeats on normal chromosomes but amplified to 50-3000 copies on DM chromosomes. Previous findings in Caucasian populations of a DM founder chromosome raise a question about the molecular events involved in the expansion mutation. To investigate whether a founder chromosome for the DM mutation exists in the Japanese population, we genotyped families using polymorphic markers near the (CTG) n repeat region and constructed haplotypes. Six different haplotypes were found and DM alleles were always haplotype A. To find an origin of the (CTG) n repeat mutation and to investigate the mechanism of the expansion mutation in the Japanese population we have studied 90 Japanese DM families comprising 190 affected and 130 unaffected members. The results suggest that a few common ancestral mutations in both Caucasian and Japanese populations have originated by expansion of an ancestral n = 5 repeat to n = 19-37 copies. These data support multistep models of triplet repeat expansion that have been proposed for both DM and Friedreichs ataxia..
The natural history of Vigabatrin associated visual field defects in patients electing to continue their medication.
The negative effects of Bisphenol A (BPA) on neurodevelopment and behaviors have been well established. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a regulatory enzyme which is involved in anxiety-like behavior. This study investigated behavioral phenotypes and AChE activity in male mice following BPA exposure during puberty. On postnatal day (PND) 35, male mice were exposed to 50mg BPA/kg diet per day for a period of 35 days. On PND71, a behavioral assay was performed using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the light/dark test. In addition, AChE activity was measured in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum and hippocampus. Results from our behavioral phenotyping indicated that anxiety-like behavior was increased in mice exposed to BPA. AChE activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of mice with BPA compared to control mice, whereas no difference was found in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum. Our findings showed that pubertal BPA exposure increased anxiety-like behavior, which may be associated with decreased AChE activity of the hippocampus in adult male mice. Further studies are necessary to investigate the cholinergic signaling of the hippocampus in PBE induced anxiety-like behaviors.
The negative mucosal potential: separating central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs in man.
The nephroprotective effect of coenzyme Q10 was investigated in mice with acute renal injury induced by a single i.p. injection of cisplatin (5 mg/kg). Coenzyme Q10 treatment (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was applied for 6 consecutive days, starting 1 day before cisplatin administration. Coenzyme Q10 significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels which were increased by cisplatin. Coenzyme Q10 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms (reduced glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity), suppressed lipid peroxidation, decreased the elevations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide and platinum ion concentration, and attenuated the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in renal tissue resulted from cisplatin administration. Also, histopathological renal tissue damage mediated by cisplatin was ameliorated by coenzyme Q10 treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased the cisplatin-induced overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor-kappaB, caspase-3 and p53 in renal tissue. It was concluded that coenzyme Q10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity commonly encountered in clinical practice.
The nephrotoxic action of anticancer drugs such as nitrogranulogen (NG), methotrexate (MTX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cyclophosphamide (CY) administered alone or in combination [MTX + 5-FU + CY (CMF)] was evaluated in experiments on Wistar rats. After drug administration, creatinine concentrations in the plasma and in the urine of the rats were determined, as well as creatinine clearance. Histopathologic evaluation of the kidneys was also performed. After MTX administration a significant increase (p = 0.0228) in the plasma creatinine concentration and a significant (p = 0.0001) decrease in creatinine clearance was noted compared to controls. After the administration of NG, 5-FU and CY neither a statistically significant increase in creatinine concentration nor an increase in creatinine clearance was observed compared to the group receiving no cytostatics. Following polytherapy according to the CMF regimen, a statistically significant decrease (p = 0.0343) in creatinine clearance was found, but creatinine concentration did not increase significantly compared to controls. CY caused hemorrhagic cystitis in 40% of rats, but it did not cause this complication when combined with 5-FU and MTX. Histologic changes were found in rat kidneys after administration of MTX, CY and NG, while no such change was observed after 5-FU and joint administration of MTX + 5-FU + CY compared to controls. Our studies indicate that nephrotoxicity of MTX + 5-FU + CY administered jointly is lower than in monotherapy.
The nephrotoxic potential of amphotericin B (5 mg/kg per day intraperitoneally for 3 weeks) has been investigated in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats. In salt-depleted rats, amphotericin B decreased creatinine clearance linearly with time, with an 85% reduction by week 3. In contrast, in normal-salt rats creatinine clearance was decreased but to a lesser extent at week 2 and 3, and in salt-loaded rats creatinine clearance did not change for 2 weeks and was decreased by 43% at week 3. All rats in the sodium-depleted group had histopathological evidence of patchy tubular cytoplasmic degeneration in tubules that was not observed in any normal-salt or salt-loaded rat. Concentrations of amphotericin B in plasma were not significantly different among the three groups at any time during the study. However, at the end of 3 weeks, amphotericin B levels in the kidneys and liver were significantly higher in salt-depleted and normal-salt rats than those in salt-loaded rats, with plasma/kidney ratios of 21, 14, and 8 in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats, respectively. In conclusion, reductions in creatinine clearance and renal amphotericin B accumulation after chronic amphotericin B administration were enhanced by salt depletion and attenuated by sodium loading in rats.
The netrin-G1 ligand NGL-1 promotes the outgrowth of thalamocortical axons.
The neural cell recognition molecule neurofascin interacts with syntenin-1 but not with syntenin-2, both of which reveal self-associating activity.
The neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in levodopa-induced dyskinesia are unclear. Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) in a group of patients with advanced Parkinson disease, the authors investigated whether modulation of SMA excitability may result in a modification of a dyskinetic state induced by continuous apomorphine infusion. rTMS at 1 Hz was observed to markedly reduce drug-induced dyskinesias, whereas 5-Hz rTMS induced a slight but not significant increase.
The neuropathy caused by a single dose of isoniazid in rats was studied with a computer-assisted morphometric method. Scatter diagrams of the g ratio (quotient fibre diameter/axon diameter) define regenerating fibres as a distinct population, distinguishable from the surviving fibres by reduced sheath thickness and reduced axon calibre. There was also evidence of a subtle direct toxic effect on the entire fibre population, causing axon shrinkage masked by readjustment of the myelin sheath.
The ninth component of human complement (C9) is the last of the terminal complement components creating the membrane attack complex. C9 is a single-chain serum protein that is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 5p. Deficiency of terminal complement components is generally associated with recurrent neisseria infections. We studied a previously described Swiss family with inherited C9 deficiency. To identify the genetic basis of C9 deficiency, we developed an approach using exon-specific PCR and direct DNA sequencing. As a cause of C9 deficiency , we found two different point mutations, both generating TGA stop codons in the coding sequence. One mutation, a C to A exchange, was detected in exon 2 at cDNA position 166, the other, a C to T exchange, was located in exon 4 (cDNA position 464). In family studies of three first-degree relatives with heterozygous C9 deficiency, we demonstrated that the two mutations are segregating independently. Therefore, these mutations are sufficient to explain the complete deficiency of both the probands studied. DNA sequencing of the exon-intron junctions revealed a number of revisions regarding the boundaries between exons 4, 5, and 6 as well as between exons 10 and 11. No additional introns were detected in exons 6 and 10. Furthermore, DNA marker studies were conducted using known polymorphisms of the C6, C7, and C9 genes, confirming the linkage of the observed C9 mutations with defined haplotypes..
The nitric oxide (NO) inhibitor nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) may act as an otoprotectant against high-frequency hearing loss caused by gentamicin, but further studies are needed to confirm this.Aminoglycoside antibiotics are still widely used by virtue of their efficacy and low cost. Their ototoxicity is a serious health problem and, as their ototoxic mechanism involves the production of NO, we need to assess the use of NO inhibitors for the prevention of aminoglycoside-induced sensorineural hearing loss. In this experimental study we used 30 Sprague-Dawley rats, 27 of which had gentamicin instilled into the middle ear. The otoprotectant L-NAME was administered topically to 12/27 animals. Its effect was determined in terms of attenuation of hearing loss, measured by shifts in the auditory brainstem response threshold. L-NAME reduced gentamicin-induced hearing loss in the high-frequency range, but gave no protection in the middle or low frequencies.
The normal Huntington disease (HD) allele, or a closely linked gene, influences age at onset of HD.
The nosology of the inborn errors of myelin metabolism has been stymied by the lack of molecular genetic analysis. Historically, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease has encompassed a host of neurologic disorders that present with a deficit of myelin, the membrane elaborated by glial cells that encircles and successively enwraps axons. We describe here a Pelizaeus-Merzbacher pedigree of the classical type, with X-linked inheritance, a typical clinical progression, and a pathologic loss of myelinating cells and myelin in the central nervous system. To discriminate variants of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, a set of oligonucleotide primers was constructed to polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) amplify and sequence the gene encoding proteolipid protein (PLP), a structural protein that comprises half of the protein of the myelin sheath. The PLP gene in one of two affected males and the carrier mother of this family exhibited a single base difference in the more than 2 kb of the PLP gene sequenced, a C----T transition that would create a serine substitution for proline at the carboxy end of the protein. Our results delineate the clinical features of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, define the possible molecular pathology of this dysmyelinating disorder, and address the molecular classification of inborn errors of myelin metabolism. Patients with the classical form (type I) and the more severely affected, connatal variant of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (type II) would be predicted to display mutation at the PLP locus. The other variants (types III-VI), which have sometimes been categorized as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, may represent mutations in genes encoding other structural myelin proteins or proteins critical to myelination..
The novel Rho-family GTPase rif regulates coordinated actin-based membrane rearrangements.
The novel anxiolytic drug, buspirone, reverses catalepsy induced by haloperidol. A series of aryl-piperazine analogues of buspirone and other 5-hydroxytryptaminergic agonists were tested for their ability to reverse haloperidol induced catalepsy. Those drugs with strong affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1a receptors were able to reverse catalepsy. Drugs with affinity for other 5-HT receptors or weak affinity were ineffective. However, inhibition of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of catalepsy and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect.
The nucleolus is the site of rRNA synthesis and processing in eukaryotic cells, but its composition remains poorly understood. We have identified a novel nucleolar RNA-associated protein (Nrap) which is highly conserved from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to human, with homologues in mouse, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and other species. In the mouse, we have found that Nrap is ubiquitously expressed and is specifically localized in the nucleolus. We have also identified splice variants in human and mouse, and defined the intron-exon structure of the human Nrap gene. Nrap is inherited into daughter nuclei by associating with the condensed chromosomes during mitosis. RNase treatment of permeabilized cells indicated that the nucleolar localization of Nrap is RNA dependent. The effects of actinomycin D, cycloheximide and 5,6-dichloro-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole on Nrap expression and distribution in cultured cells suggest that Nrap is associated with the pre-rRNA transcript. Nrap is a large nucleolar protein (of more than 1000 amino acids), and is a new class of protein with new structural and functional motifs. Nrap appears to be associated with ribosome biogenesis by interacting with pre-rRNA primary transcript.
The ob gene product, leptin, apparently exclusively expressed in adipose tissue, is a signaling factor regulating body weight homeostasis and energy balance. ob gene expression is increased in obese rodents and regulated by feeding, insulin, and glucocorticoids, which supports the concept that ob gene expression is under hormonal control, which is expected for a key factor controlling body weight homeostasis and energy balance. In humans, ob mRNA expression is increased in gross obesity; however, the effects of the above factors on human ob expression are unknown. We describe the structure of the human ob gene and initial functional analysis of its promoter. The human ob gene's three exons cover approximately 15 kb of genomic DNA. The entire coding region is contained in exons 2 and 3, which are separated by a 2-kb intron. The first small 30-bp untranslated exon is located >10.5 kb upstream of the initiator ATG codon. Three kilobases of DNA upstream of the transcription start site has been cloned and characterized. Only 217 bp of 5' sequence are required for basal adipose tissue-specific expression of the ob gene as well as enhanced expression by C/EBPalpha. Mutation of the single C/EBPalpha site in this region abolished inducibility of the promoter by C/EBPalpha in cotransfection assays. The gene structure will facilitate our analysis of ob mutations in human obesity, whereas knowledge of sequence elements and factors regulating ob gene expression should be of major importance in the prevention and treatment of obesity.
The objective of this study was to assess minor neurological dysfunction, cognitive development, and somatic development after dexamethasone therapy in very-low-birthweight infants. Thirty-three children after dexamethasone treatment were matched to 33 children without dexamethasone treatment. Data were assessed at the age of 3-7 years. Dexamethasone was started between the 7th and the 28th day of life over 7 days with a total dose of 2.35 mg/kg/day. Exclusion criteria were asphyxia, malformations, major surgical interventions, small for gestational age, intraventricular haemorrhage grades III and IV, periventricular leukomalacia, and severe psychomotor retardation. Each child was examined by a neuropediatrician for minor neurological dysfunctions and tested by a psychologist for cognitive development with a Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and a Draw-a-Man Test. There were no differences in demographic data, growth, and socio-economic status between the two groups. Fine motor skills and gross motor function were significantly better in the control group (p<0.01). In the Draw-a-Man Test, the control group showed better results (p<0.001). There were no differences in development of speech, social development, and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. After dexamethasone treatment, children showed a higher rate of minor neurological dysfunctions. Neurological development was affected even without neurological diagnosis. Further long-term follow-up studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the impact of dexamethasone on neurological and cognitive development.
The objective of this study was to determine whether ephedrine, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist previously shown to enhance genital blood flow in women, has beneficial effects in reversing antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction. Nineteen sexually dysfunctional women receiving either fluoxetine, sertraline, or paroxetine participated in an eight-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of the effects of ephedrine (50 mg) on self-report measures of sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction. Although there were significant improvements relative to baseline in sexual desire and orgasm intensity/pleasure on 50 mg ephedrine 1-hr prior to sexual activity, significant improvements in these measures, as well as in sexual arousal and orgasmic ability also were noted with placebo. These findings highlight the importance of conducting placebo-controlled trials for this condition.
The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on parkinsonian 'off' signs and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID). We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests (Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery, whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in LID. We also found a highly significant correlation (P: < 0.0001, r = 0.8) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in LID in the contralateral limbs, whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian 'off' signs. The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or parkinsonian 'off' signs. The differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian 'off' signs and LID and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian 'off' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian 'off' signs and dyskinesias. Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in parkinsonism, the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of LID. We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate parkinsonism and dyskinesias, especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy. The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms, and hence could be variable.
The objective of this study was to provide more accurate frequency estimates of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) germline alterations in the ovarian cancer population. To achieve this, we determined the prevalence of BRCA1 alterations in a population-based series of consecutive ovarian cancer cases. This is the first population-based ovarian cancer study reporting BRCA1 alterations derived from a comprehensive screen of the entire coding region. One hundred and seven ovarian cancer cases were analyzed for BRCA1 alterations using the RNase mismatch cleavage assay followed by direct sequencing. Two truncating mutations, 962del4 and 3600del11, were identified. Both patients had a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Several novel as well as previously reported uncharacterized variants were also identified, some of which were associated with a family history of cancer. The frequency distribution of common polymorphisms was determined in the 91 Caucasian cancer cases in this series and 24 sister controls using allele-specific amplification. The rare form of the Q356R polymorphism was significantly (P = 0. 03) associated with a family history of ovarian cancer, suggesting that this polymorphism may influence ovarian cancer risk. In summary, our data suggest a role for some uncharacterized variants and rare forms of polymorphisms in determining ovarian cancer risk, and highlight the necessity to screen for missense alterations as well as truncating mutations in this population.
The objective of this study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness of the prophylactic administration of lamivudine in hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBs Ag) positive patients with rheumatologic disease. From June 2004 to October 2006, 11 HBs Ag positive patients with rheumatologic diseases, who were on both immunosuppressive and prophylactic lamivudine therapies, were retrospectively assessed. Liver function tests, hepatitis B virus (HBV) serologic markers, and HBV DNA levels of the patients during follow-up were obtained from hospital file records. Eleven patients (six male) with median age 47 years (range 27-73), median disease duration 50 months (range 9-178) and median follow-up period of patients 13.8 months (range 5-27) were enrolled in this study. Lamivudine therapy was started 3-7 days prior to immunosuppressive therapy in all patients. Baseline, liver function tests were elevated in two patients (fourth patient: ALT:122 IU/l, AST:111 IU/l, tenth patient:ALT:294 IU/l, AST:274 IU/l, with minimal changes in the liver biopsy in both). Shortly after treatment their tests normalized and during follow-up period none of the patients had abnormal liver function tests. In four patients HBV DNA levels were higher than normal at baseline. Two of these normalized and the others increased later. In three additional patients, HBV DNA levels were increased during follow-up. None of the patients had significant clinical sings of HBV activation. Lamivudine was well tolerated and was continued in all patients. Prophylactic administration of lamivudine in patients who required immunosuppressive therapy seems to be safe, well tolerated and effective in preventing HBV reactivation.
The occurrence of a myocardial infarction is reported after chemotherapy containing etoposide, in a man with no risk factors for coronary heart disease. Possible causal mechanisms are discussed.
The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) is an X-linked disorder characterized by major abnormalities of eyes, nervous system, and kidneys. Mutations in the OCRL1 gene have been associated with the disease. OCRL1 encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-biphosphate (PtdIns [4, 5] P2) 5-phosphatase. We have examined the OCRL1 gene in eight unrelated patients with OCRL and have found seven new mutations and one recurrent in-frame deletion. Among the new mutations, two nonsense mutations (R317X and E558X) and three other frameshift mutations caused premature termination of the protein. A missense mutation, R483G, was located in the highly conserved PtdIns (4, 5) P2 5-phosphatase domain. Finally, one frameshift mutation, 2799delC, modifies the C-terminal part of OCRL1, with an extension of six amino acids. Altogether, 70% of missense mutations are located in exon 15, and 52% of all mutations cluster in exons 11-15. We also identified two new microsatellite markers for the OCRL1 locus, and we detected a germline mosaicism in one family. This observation has direct implications for genetic counseling of Lowe syndrome families..
The order of fourteen polymorphic markers localised to the long arm of human chromosome 19 has been established by multipoint mapping in a set of 40 CEPH (Centre dEtude de Polymorphisme Humain, Paris) reference families. We report here the linkage relationship of the myotonic dystrophy (DM) locus to twelve of these markers as studied in 45 families with DM. The resulting genetic map is supported by the localisation of the DNA markers in a panel of somatic cell hybrids. Ten of the twelve markers have been shown to be proximal to the DM gene and two, PRKCG and D19S22, distal but at distances of approximately 25 cM and 15 cM, respectively. The closest proximal markers are APOC2 (apolipoprotein C-II) and CKM (creatine kinase, muscle) approximately 3 cM and 2 cM from the DM gene respectively, in the order APOC2-CKM-DM. The distance between APOC2, CKM and DM (of the order of 2 million base pairs) and their known orientation should permit directional chromosome walking and jumping. The data presented here should enable us to determine whether or not new markers are distal to APOC2/CKM and thus potentially flank the DM gene..
The organization of chromatin into higher-order structures influences chromosome function and epigenetic gene regulation. Higher-order chromatin has been proposed to be nucleated by the covalent modification of histone tails and the subsequent establishment of chromosomal subdomains by non-histone modifier factors. Here we show that human SUV39H1 and murine Suv39h1--mammalian homologues of Drosophila Su(var)3-9 and of Schizosaccharomyces pombe clr4--encode histone H3-specific methyltransferases that selectively methylate lysine 9 of the amino terminus of histone H3 in vitro. We mapped the catalytic motif to the evolutionarily conserved SET domain, which requires adjacent cysteine-rich regions to confer histone methyltransferase activity. Methylation of lysine 9 interferes with phosphorylation of serine 10, but is also influenced by pre-existing modifications in the amino terminus of H3. In vivo, deregulated SUV39H1 or disrupted Suv39h activity modulate H3 serine 10 phosphorylation in native chromatin and induce aberrant mitotic divisions. Our data reveal a functional interdependence of site-specific H3 tail modifications and suggest a dynamic mechanism for the regulation of higher-order chromatin.
The orthologous human and murine semaphorin 6A-1 proteins (SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1) bind to the enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-like protein (EVL) via a novel carboxyl-terminal zyxin-like domain.
The p53 family member genes are involved in the Notch signal pathway.
The p53 oncosuppressor protein is subject to negative regulation by MDM2, which efficiently inhibits its activity through an autoregulatory loop. In response to stress, however, p53 undergoes post-translational modifications that allow the protein to escape MDM2 control, accumulate, and become active. Recent studies have shown that, following DNA damage, the HIPK2 serine/threonine kinase binds and phosphorylates p53, inducing p53 transcriptional activity and apoptotic function. Here, we investigated the role of HIPK2 in the activation of p53 in the presence of MDM2. We found that HIPK2 rescues p53 transcriptional activity overcoming MDM2 inhibition, and that restoration of this p53 function induces apoptosis. Recovery of p53-dependent apoptosis is achieved by preventing p53 nuclear export and ubiquitination mediated by MDM2 in vitro and in vivo following genotoxic stress. These results shed new light on the mechanisms by which the HIPK2/p53 pathway promotes apoptosis and suppression of tumorigenesis.
The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor that regulates cell growth and death in response to environmental stimuli such as DNA damage. p63/p51 and p73 were recently identified as members of the p53 gene family. In contrast to p53 however, p63 and p73 are rarely mutated in human cancers. Mice that lack p53 are developmentally normal, while p63 and p73 appear to play critical roles in normal development. To determine how p63 and p73 are involved in normal development, we attempted to identify target genes that are specifically regulated by p63 and/or p73 but not by p53. We found that the Jagged1 (JAG1) and Jagged2 (JAG2) genes, encoding ligands for the Notch receptors, are up-regulated by p63 and p73. Furthermore, we identified a p63-binding site in the second intron of the JAG1 gene, which can directly interact with the p63 protein in vivo, as assessed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. A heterologous reporter assay revealed that this p63-binding site is a functional response element and is specific for p63. We also found a target of Notch signaling, HES-1 was up-regulated in Jurkat cells, in which Notch1 is highly expressed, when co-cultured with p63-transfected cells, suggesting that p63 can trigger the Notch signal pathway in neighboring cells. Our findings show an association between the p53 family genes and Notch signaling and suggest a potential molecular mechanism for the involvement of the p53 family genes in normal development.
The participation of reactive oxygen species in aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity has been deduced from observations that aminoglycoside-iron complexes catalyze the formation of superoxide radicals in vitro and that antioxidants attenuate ototoxicity in vivo. We therefore hypothesized that overexpression of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (h-SOD1) should protect transgenic mice from ototoxicity. Immunocytochemistry confirmed expression of h-SOD1 in inner ear tissues of transgenic C57BL/6-TgN[SOD1]3Cje mice. Transgenic and nontransgenic littermates received kanamycin (400 mg/kg body weight/day) for 10 days beginning on day 10 after birth. Auditory thresholds were tested by evoked auditory brain stem responses at 1 month after birth. In nontransgenic animals, the threshold in the kanamycin-treated group was 45-50 dB higher than in saline-injected controls. In the transgenic group, kanamycin increased the threshold by only 15 dB over the respective controls. The effects were similar at 12 and 24 kHz. The protection by overexpression of superoxide dismutase supports the hypothesis that oxidant stress plays a significant role in aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. The results also suggest transgenic animals as suitable models to investigate the underlying mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention.
The pathogenesis of Heymann nephritis, a rat model of human membranous glomerulonephritis, depends on the interaction of autoantibodies with a renal glycoprotein (GP330) on glomerular podocytes. Partial complementary DNAs coding for GP330 were isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence from 4.3 kilobases of complementary DNA contains the sequences identical to two peptides derived from the isolated glycoprotein. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein contains regions with homology to the human low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, an indication that GP330 and the LDL receptor may be members of the same gene family. Autoantibodies from the kidneys of rats with Heymann nephritis reacted with a nonglycosylated segment of GP330 that contains cysteine-rich 40-amino acid repeats, which are also features of the LDL receptor. GP330 is also similar in some regions to the mouse epidermal growth factor precursor.
The pathomechanism of nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN) is unknown. The aim of this study was to delineate brain structures that are involved in NIN generation. Eight healthy volunteers inhaled nicotine in darkness during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment; eye movements were registered using video-oculography. NIN correlated with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity levels in a midpontine site in the posterior basis pontis. NIN-induced midpontine activation may correspond to activation of the dorsomedial pontine nuclei and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, structures known to participate in the generation of multidirectional saccades and smooth pursuit eye movements.
The pathophysiology of painful temporomandibular disorders is not fully understood, but evidence suggests that muscle pain modulates motor function in characteristic ways. This study tested the hypothesis that activation of nociceptive muscle afferent fibers would be linked to an increased excitability of the human jaw-stretch reflex and whether this process would be sensitive to length and velocity of the stretch. Capsaicin (10 micro g) was injected into the masseter muscle to induce pain in 11 healthy volunteers. Short-latency reflex responses were evoked in the masseter and temporalis muscles by a stretch device with different velocities and displacements before, during, and after the pain. The normalized reflex amplitude increased with an increase in velocity at a given displacement, but remained constant with different displacements at a given velocity. The normalized reflex amplitude was significantly higher during pain, but only at faster stretches in the painful muscle. Increased sensitivity of the fusimotor system during acute muscle pain could be one likely mechanism to explain the findings.
The patient, H. Chr. B., was among the first reported with hyperuricemia and central nervous system symptoms. He has been found to have a variant of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT; E. C. 2. 4. 2. 8) distinct from the enzyme present in patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The patient had chroeoathetosis, spasticity, dysarthric speech, and hyperuricemia. However, his intelligence was normal and he had no evidence of self-mutilation. There was no activity of HPRT in the lysates of erythrocytes and cultured fibroblasts when analyzed in the usual manner. Using a newly developed method for the study of purine metabolism in intact cultured cells, this patient was found to metabolize some 9% of 8-14C-hypoxanthine, and 90% of the isotope utilized was converted to adenine and guanine nucleotides. In contrast, cells from patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome were virtually completely unable to convert hypoxanthine to nucleotides. The patients fibroblasts were even more efficient in the metabolism of 8-14C-guanine, which was utilized to the extent of 27%, over 80% of which was converted to guanine and adenine nucleotides. The growth of the cultured fibroblasts of this patient was intermediate in media containing hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine (HAT), whereas the growth of Lesch-Nyhan cells was inhibited and normal cells grew normally. Similarly in 8-azaguanine, 6-thioguanine, and 8-azahypoxanthine, the growth of the patients cells was intermediate between normal and Lesch-Nyhan cells. These observations provide further evidence for genetic heterogeneity among patients with disorders in purine metabolism involving the HPRT gene. They document that this famous patient did not have the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
The pharmacogenetics of NAT: structural aspects.
The plasma lipoprotein profiles and high density lipoproteins (HDL) were characterized in patients with the genetic disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Abnormalities in the HDL may contribute to their increased atherogenesis and excessive deposits of tissue sterols in the presence of low or low-normal concentrations of plasma cholesterol (165 +/- 25 mg/dl) and low density lipoproteins (LDL). The mean HDL-cholesterol concentration in the CTX plasmas was 14. 5 +/- 3. 2 mg/dl, about one-third the normal value. The low HDL-cholesterol reflects a low concentration and an abnormal lipid composition of the plasma HDL. Relative to normal HDL, the cholesteryl esters are low, free cholesterol and phospholipids essentially normal, and triglycerides increased. The ratio of apoprotein (apo) to total cholesterol in the HDL of CTX was two to three times greater than normal. In the CTX HDL, the ratio of apoAI to apoAII was high, the proportion of apoC low, and a normally minor form of apoAI increased relative to other forms. The HDL in electron micrographs appeared normal morphologically and in particle size. The abnormalities in lipoprotein distribution profile and composition of the plasma HDL result from metabolic defects that are not understood but may be linked to the genetic defect in bile acid synthesis in CTX. As a consequence, it is probable that the normal functions of the HDL, possibly including modulation of LDL-cholesterol uptake and the removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues, are perturbed significantly in this disease.
The plasticity of primary motor cortex (M1) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) is severely impaired. We recently reported in young healthy subjects that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation enhanced the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 that was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS). This study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor M1 plasticity in 16 patients with LIDs could be reinstated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimulation. This was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity, indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resurgence of M1 plasticity. The benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on LIDs is known. To explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of M1, we conducted an additional study looking at changes in LIDs and PAS-induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral, real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation. Only real and not sham stimulation had an antidyskinetic effect and it was paralleled by a resurgence in the sensorimotor plasticity of M1. These results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function, occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it, may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of M1 and the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements.
The possible relationship between mesangial dysfunction and development of glomerular sclerosis was studied in the puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) model. Five male Wistar rats received repeated subcutaneous PAN injections; five controls received saline only. After 4 weeks the PAN rats were severely proteinuric (190 +/- 80 mg/24 hr), and all rats were given colloidal carbon (CC) intravenously. At 5 months glomerular sclerosis was found in 7.6 +/- 3.4% of the glomeruli of PAN rats; glomeruli of the controls were normal. Glomeruli of PAN rats contained significantly more CC than glomeruli of controls. Glomeruli with sclerosis contained significantly more CC than non-sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidneys. CC was preferentially localized within the sclerotic areas of the affected glomeruli. Since mesangial CC clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic PAN treatment, we conclude that this preferential CC localization within the lesions is caused by an increased CC uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where sclerosis will develop subsequently. Cluster analysis showed a random distribution of lesions in the PAN glomeruli in concordance with the random localization of mesangial areas with dysfunction in this model. Similar to the remnant kidney model in PAN nephrosis the development of glomerular sclerosis may be related to "mesangial overloading."
The potential for tenofovir to cause a range of kidney syndromes has been established from mechanistic and randomised clinical trials. However, the exact pattern of kidney involvement is still uncertain. We undertook a descriptive analysis of Yellow Card records of 407 HIV-positive persons taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) as part of their antiretroviral therapy regimen and submitted to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with suspected kidney adverse effects. Reports that satisfy defined criteria were classified as acute kidney injury, kidney tubular dysfunction and Fanconi syndrome. Of the 407 Yellow Card records analysed, 106 satisfied criteria for TDF-related kidney disease, of which 53 (50%) had features of kidney tubular dysfunction, 35 (33%) were found to have features of glomerular dysfunction and 18 (17%) had Fanconi syndrome. The median TDF exposure was 316 days (interquartile range 120-740). The incidence of hospitalisation for TDF kidney adverse effects was high, particularly amongst patients with features of Fanconi syndrome. The pattern of kidney syndromes in this population series mirrors that reported in randomised clinical trials. Cessation of TDF was associated with complete restoration of kidney function in up half of the patients in this report.
The potential modifying effect of retinyl acetate (RA) on butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)-induced rat forestomach tumorigenesis was examined. Male F344 rats, 5 weeks of age, were maintained on diet containing 1% or 2% BHA by weight and simultaneously on drinking water supplemented with RA at various concentrations (w/v) for 52 weeks. In groups given 2% BHA, although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals, co-administration of 0.25% RA significantly (P less than 0.05) increased the incidence of forestomach tumors (squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma) to 60% (9/15, 2 rats with carcinoma) from 15% (3/20, one rat with carcinoma) in the group given RA-free water. In rats given 1% BHA, RA co-administered at a dose of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.25% showed a dose-dependent enhancing effect on the development of the BHA-induced epithelial hyperplasia. Tumors, all papillomas, were induced in 3 rats (17%) with 0.25% RA and in one rat (10%) with 0.05% RA co-administration. RA alone did not induce hyperplastic changes in the forestomach. These findings indicate that RA acted as a co-carcinogen in the BHA forestomach carcinogenesis of the rat.
The potential protective effect of the dietary antioxidant curcumin (120 mg/Kg/day for 6 days) against the renal injury induced by maleate was evaluated. Tubular proteinuria and oxidative stress were induced by a single injection of maleate (400 mg/kg) in rats. Maleate-induced renal injury included increase in renal vascular resistance and in the urinary excretion of total protein, glucose, sodium, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and N-acetyl b-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), upregulation of kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, decrease in renal blood flow and claudin-2 expression besides of necrosis and apoptosis of tubular cells on 24 h. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the oxidation of lipids and proteins and diminution in renal Nrf2 levels. Studies were also conducted in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells and in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of all the experimental groups. Maleate induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in LLC-PK1 cells in culture. In addition, maleate treatment reduced oxygen consumption in ADP-stimulated mitochondria and diminished respiratory control index when using malate/glutamate as substrate. The activities of both complex I and aconitase were also diminished. All the above-described alterations were prevented by curcumin. It is concluded that curcumin is able to attenuate in vivo maleate-induced nephropathy and in vitro cell damage. The in vivo protection was associated to the prevention of oxidative stress and preservation of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex I, and the in vitro protection was associated to the prevention of ROS production.
The predicted sequence of human gastric cathepsin E (CTSE) was determined by analysis of cDNA clones isolated from a library constructed with poly(A+) RNA from a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line. The CTSE cDNA clones were identified using a set of complementary 18-base oligonucleotide probes specific for a 6-residue sequence surrounding the first active site of all previously characterized human aspartic proteinases. Sequence analysis of CTSE cDNA clones revealed a 1188-base pair open reading frame that exhibited 59% sequence identity with human pepsinogen A. The predicted CTSE amino acid sequence includes a 379-residue proenzyme (Mr = 40,883) and a 17-residue signal peptide. The predicted CTSE amino acid composition was consistent with that of purified material from gastric mucosa and gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines. Additional evidence for the identification of the CTSE cDNA clones was obtained by analysis of poly(A+) RNA isolated from CTSE-producing and -nonproducing gastric adenocarcinoma cell subclones. Three RNA transcripts (3.6, 2.6, and 2.1 kilobases) were identified in poly(A+) RNA isolated from a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line that produced CTSE that were absent from nonproducing subclones. CTSE contains 7 cysteine residues, of which 6 were localized by comparative maximal alignment analysis with pepsinogen A to conserved residues that form intrachain disulfide bonds. The seventh cysteine residue of CTSE is located within the activation peptide region of the proenzyme. We suspect that this residue forms an interchain disulfide bond and thereby determines the dimerization of CTSE proenzyme molecules that is observed under native conditions. The CTSE gene was localized to human chromosome 1 by concurrent cytogenetic and cDNA probe analyses of a panel of human x mouse somatic cell hybrids.
The presence of nebulin in a muscle specimen from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) due to a large deletion precludes the possibility that this protein is the DMD gene product..
The presence of two different infantile Tay-Sachs disease mutations in a Cajun population.
The present experiments were performed to study the effect of the flavonoid apigenin (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.), 1 h before acquisition), on 24 h retention performance and forgetting of a step-through passive avoidance task, in young male Wistar rats. There were no differences between saline- and apigenin-treated groups in the 24 h retention trial. Furthermore, apigenin did not prevent the amnesia induced by scopolamine (1mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before the acquisition). The saline- and apigenin-treated rats that did not step through into the dark compartment during the cut-off time (540 s) were retested weekly for up to eight weeks. In the saline treated group, the first significant decline in passive avoidance response was observed at four weeks, and complete memory loss was found five weeks after the acquisition of the passive avoidance task. At the end of the experimental period, 60% of the animals treated with apigenin still did not step through. These data suggest that 1) apigenin delays the long-term forgetting but did not modulate the 24 h retention of fear memory and 2) the obtained beneficial effect of apigenin on the passive avoidance conditioning is mediated by mechanisms that do not implicate its action on the muscarinic cholinergic system.
The present paper describes the primary structure, glycosylation and tissue localization of fetal antigen 1 (FA1) isolated from second-trimester human amniotic fluid. FA1 is a single-chained, heterogeneous glycoprotein of 225-262 amino acid residues. FA1 has six well conserved epidermal-growth-factor motifs and contains up to ten O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation sites, six of which are differentially glycosylated. Alignment to the translated sequences of Mus. musculus dlk and human dlk revealed 86% and 99% identity, respectively, to a 259-amino-acid residue overlap, and this high similarity extends with minor corrections to the human adrenal-specific mRNA, pG2 as well. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of FA1 in 10 out of 14 lung tumors containing neuroendocrine elements, and in the placental villi where FA1 was exclusively seen in stromal cells in close contact to the vascular structure. In the pancreas, FA1 co-localized with insulin in the insulin secretory granules of the beta cells within the islets of Langerhans. Our findings suggest that FA1 is synthesized as a membrane anchored protein and released into the circulation after enzymic cleavage, and that circulating FA1 represents the post-translationally modified gene product of human dlk which, in turn, is identical to human adrenal-specific mRNA pG2.
The present report describes a case of cardiac arrest and subsequent death as a result of hyperkalaemia following the use of suxamethonium in a 23-year-old Malawian woman. Five days after the onset of the symptoms of meningitis, the patient aspirated stomach contents and needed endotracheal intubation. Forty seconds after injection of suxamethonium, bradycardia and cardiac arrest occurred. Attempts to resuscitate the patient were not successful. The serum level of potassium was observed to be 8.4 mequiv L-1. Apart from the reduction in the patient's level of consciousness, there were no signs of motor neurone damage or of any of the other known predisposing conditions for hyperkalaemia following the administration of suxamethonium. It is postulated that her death was caused by hypersensitivity to suxamethonium, associated with her 5-day immobilization.
The present report describes a case of eosinophilic myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The 47-year-old female patient, known to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was admitted with biventricular failure and managed aggressively with dobutamine infusion and other drugs while being assessed for heart transplantation. On transthoracic echocardiogram, she had moderate left ventricular dysfunction with regional variability and moderate mitral regurgitation. The recipient's heart showed the features of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocarditis with abundant eosinophils. Myocarditis is rare and eosinophilic myocarditis is rarer. It is likely that the hypersensitivity (eosinophilic) myocarditis was related to dobutamine infusion therapy. Eosinophilic myocarditis has been reported with an incidence of 2.4% to 7.2% in explanted hearts and may be related to multidrug therapy.
The present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin D treatment enhance the extent of artery calcification in rats given sufficient doses of Warfarin to inhibit gamma-carboxylation of matrix Gla protein, a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall. The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin-treated rats. Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20-day-old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42-day-old rats. In contrast, no artery calcification could be detected in 10-month-old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment. To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin-induced artery calcification in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth. Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group. Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification, with 30% higher levels of serum phosphate in young, ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin-induced artery calcification, ie, the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited young rats. This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin-induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels. The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification. High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days. High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week. In the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D-treated rats at 3 and 4 days. There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium, which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium. Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D, the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor. High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma-carboxylated. These observations indicate that although the gamma-carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor, they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites.
The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine-induced catatonia in the intact, pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat. In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of catatonia (DOC) after ketamine, but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not. The pineal indolamines exhibited mixed actions. Serotonin and N-acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine DOC, did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland, whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick. Ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent; furthermore, melatonin did not augment the ketamine DOC whereas dopamine continued to do so. This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the amines on the pineal in spite of the immature blood-brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat. In addition, these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine DOC induced by melatonin. Furthermore, dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine catatonia rather than directly on the pituitary.
The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters (glutamate, aspartate, glycine and GABA) of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea (VPU) in comparison to its parent compound, valproic acid (VPA). VPU was more potent than VPA, exhibiting the median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine-induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg/kg. In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA. Pretreatment with either VPU (50 and 100 mg/kg) or VPA (300 and 600 mg/kg) completely abolished pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate. In addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level. Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine-induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate. Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine-induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine-induced seizure in experimental animals. Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated.
The present study describes the delayed development of a severe bladder pathology in a susceptible strain of mice (DBA/2) but not in a resistant strain (C57BL/6) when both were treated with a single 300 mg/kg dose of cyclophosphamide (CY). Inbred DBA/2 and C57BL/6 female mice were injected with CY, and the effect of the drug on the bladder was assessed during 100 days by light microscopy using different staining procedures, and after 30 days by conventional electron microscopy. Early CY toxicity caused a typical haemorrhagic cystitis in both strains that was completely repaired in about 7-10 days. After 30 days of CY injection ulcerous and non-ulcerous forms of chronic cystitis appeared in 86% of DBA/2 mice but only in 4% of C57BL/6 mice. Delayed cystitis was characterized by infiltration and transepithelial passage into the lumen of inflammatory cells and by frequent exfoliation of the urothelium. Mast cells appeared in the connective and muscular layers of the bladder at a much higher number in DBA/2 mice than in C57BL/6 mice or untreated controls. Electron microscopy disclosed the absence of the typical discoidal vesicles normally present in the cytoplasm of surface cells. Instead, numerous abnormal vesicles containing one or several dark granules were observed in the cytoplasm of cells from all the epithelial layers. Delayed cystitis still persisted in DBA/2 mice 100 days after treatment. These results indicate that delayed toxicity of CY in female DBA/2 mice causes a bladder pathology that is not observed in C57BL/6 mice. This pathology resembles interstitial cystitis in humans and could perhaps be used as an animal model for studies on the disease.
The present study examines the effect of 6-day epinephrine treatment (100 micrograms/kg per h, s.c.) on stimulus-induced (1 Hz) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of vehicle- and epinephrine-treated rats. Renal catecholamine stores and stimulus-induced overflow in the vehicle-treated group consisted of norepinephrine only. However, epinephrine treatment resulted in the incorporation of epinephrine into renal catecholamine stores such that approximately 40% of the catecholamine present was epinephrine while the norepinephrine content was reduced by a similar degree. Total tissue catecholamine content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged. Stimulus-induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the epinephrine-treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both norepinephrine and epinephrine in proportions similar to those found in the kidney. This difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade. Propranolol had no effect on stimulus-induced overflow in either group. Phentolamine increased stimulus-induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the epinephrine-treated group. In conclusion, chronic epinephrine treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow. However, neither alterations in prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration. Furthermore, data obtained with phentolamine alone do not suggest alpha-adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after epinephrine treatment.
The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions, total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice. The ethanolic extract of Daucus carota seeds (DCE) was administered orally in three doses (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam-, scopolamine- and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. DCE (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. The extent of memory improvement evoked by DCE was 23% at the dose of 200 mg/kg and 35% at the dose of 400 mg/kg in young mice using elevated plus maze. Similarly, significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice. Furthermore, DCE reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Daucus carota extract (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mice. The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by DCE at the dose of 400 mg/kg was 22% in young and 19% in aged mice. There was a remarkable reduction in total cholesterol level as well, to the extent of 23% in young and 21% in aged animals with this dose of DCE. Therefore, DCE may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as, memory improving property, cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity.
The present study was aimed to determine whether there is an altered regulation of tubular transporters in gentamicin-induced nephropathy. Sprague-Dawley male rats (200~250 g) were subcutaneously injected with gentamicin (100 mg/kg per day) for 7 days, and the expression of tubular transporters was determined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein expression of OAT was also determined. Gentamicin-treated rats exhibited significantly decreased creatinine clearance along with increased plasma creatinine levels. Accordingly, the fractional excretion of sodium increased. Urine volume was increased, while urine osmolality and free water reabsorption were decreased. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry revealed decreased expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, NHE3, NBC1, and AQP1 in the kidney of gentamicin-treated rats. The expression of OAT1 and OAT3 was also decreased. Gentamicin-induced nephropathy may at least in part be causally related with a decreased expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, NHE3, NBC1, AQP1 and OAT.
The present study was aimed to investigate the combined effects of green tea and vitamin E on heart weight, body weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation, endogenous antioxidants and membrane bound ATPases in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Adult male albino rats, treated with ISO (200 mg/kg, s.c.) for 2 days at an interval of 24 h caused a significant (P<0.05) elevation of heart weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation and Ca+2 ATPase level whereas there was a significant (P<0.05) decrease in body weight, endogenous antioxidants, Na+/ K+ ATPase and Mg+2 ATPase levels. Administration of green tea (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and vitamin E (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) together for 30 consecutive days and challenged with ISO on the day 29th and 30th, showed a significant (P<0.05) decrease in heart weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation, Ca+2 ATPase and a significant increase in the body weight, endogenous antioxidants, Na+/K+ ATPase and Mg+2 ATPase when compared with ISO treated group and green tea or vitamin E alone treated groups. These findings indicate the synergistic protective effect of green tea and vitamin E during ISO induced myocardial infarction in rats.
The present study was carried out to test the effects of L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (L-alpha-GFC) on memory impairment induced by scopolamine in man. Thirty-two healthy young volunteers were randomly allocated to four different groups. They were given a ten day pretreatment with either L-alpha-GFC or placebo, p.o., and on the eleventh day either scopolamine or placebo, i.m. Before and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 6 h after injection the subjects were given attention and mnemonic tests. The findings of this study indicate that the drug is able to antagonize impairment of attention and memory induced by scopolamine.
The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Hemodynamic parameters and lead II electrocardiograph were monitored and recorded continuously. Cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured. Assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were performed. Isoproterenol-treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase and malondialdehyde and significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in serum and heart. These rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure, and elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and ST-segment. In addition, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP/O was observed in isoproterenol-treated rats. Administration of salvianolic acid A for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function. The protective role of salvianolic acid A against isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination. The results of our study suggest that salvianolic acid A possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction.
The present study was designed to examine the effect of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the subregions of the nucleus accumbens (the shell and the core) on the locomotor hyperactivity induced by cocaine in rats. Male Wistar rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae into the accumbens shell or core, and then were locally injected with GR 55562 (an antagonist of 5-HT1B receptors) or CP 93129 (an agonist of 5-HT1B receptors). Given alone to any accumbal subregion, GR 55562 (0.1-10 microg/side) or CP 93129 (0.1-10 microg/side) did not change basal locomotor activity. Systemic cocaine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the locomotor activity of rats. GR 55562 (0.1-10 microg/side), administered intra-accumbens shell prior to cocaine, dose-dependently attenuated the psychostimulant-induced locomotor hyperactivity. Such attenuation was not found in animals which had been injected with GR 55562 into the accumbens core. When injected into the accumbens shell (but not the core) before cocaine, CP 93129 (0.1-10 microg/side) enhanced the locomotor response to cocaine; the maximum effect being observed after 10 microg/side of the agonist. The later enhancement was attenuated after intra-accumbens shell treatment with GR 55562 (1 microg/side). Our findings indicate that cocaine induced hyperlocomotion is modified by 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell, but not core, this modification consisting in inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (GR 55562) and agonist (CP 93129), respectively. In other words, the present results suggest that the accumbal shell 5-HT1B receptors play a permissive role in the behavioural response to the psychostimulant.
The present study was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of betaine on acute myocardial ischemia induced experimentally in rats focusing on regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and apoptotic pathways as the potential mechanism underlying the drug effect. Male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with betaine (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) orally for 40 days. Acute myocardial ischemic injury was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (85 mg/kg), for two consecutive days. Serum cardiac marker enzyme, histopathological variables and expression of protein levels were analyzed. Oral administration of betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly reduced the level of cardiac marker enzyme in the serum and prevented left ventricular remodeling. Western blot analysis showed that isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was maintained or further enhanced by betaine treatment in myocardium. Furthermore, betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) treatment increased the ventricular expression of Bcl-2 and reduced the level of Bax, therefore causing a significant increase in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. The protective role of betaine on myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination. In summary, our results showed that betaine pretreatment attenuated isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial ischemia via the regulation of STAT3 and apoptotic pathways.
The present study was undertaken to examine the role of sleep disturbance, induced by clomipramine administration, on the secretory rate of prolactin (PRL) in addition to the direct drug effect. Two groups of supine subjects were studied under placebo-controlled conditions, one during the night, when sleeping (n = 7) and the other at daytime, when awake (n = 6). Each subject received a single 50 mg dose of clomipramine given orally 2 hours before blood collection. Plasma PRL concentrations were analysed at 10 min intervals and underlying secretory rates calculated by a deconvolution procedure. For both experiments the drug intake led to significant increases in PRL secretion, acting preferentially on tonic secretion as pulse amplitude and frequency did not differ significantly from corresponding control values. During the night clomipramine ingestion altered the complete sleep architecture in that it suppressed REM sleep and the sleep cycles and induced increased wakefulness. As the relative increase in PRL secretion expressed as a percentage of the mean did not significantly differ between the night and day time studies (46 +/- 19% vs 34 +/- 10%), it can be concluded that the observed sleep disturbance did not interfere with the drug action per se. The presence of REM sleep was shown not to be a determining factor either for secretory pulse amplitude and frequency, as, for both, mean nocturnal values were similar with and without prior clomipramine ingestion.
The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of phenobarbital (PB: 15 mg per rat of ingested dose) on carcinogenesis when it is administered simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine (DEN: 10 mg/kg/day). Wistar rats (180 g) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + PB during 2, 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis. After the end of the treatment, the number and the size of induced PAS positive preneoplastic foci was significantly reduced when PB was given simultaneously with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks. The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN treated rats were also significantly decreased in DEN + PB treated rats. When the treatment last only 2 weeks, the presence of PB did not change significantly the last parameters. In DEN + PB treated rats, the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by DEN alone. It is concluded that PB, which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the DEN treatment, reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with DEN. This 'anti-carcinogen' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the precancerous lesions. Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this 'paradoxical' PB effect.
The pressor response to the intracisternal (i.c.) injection of carbachol (1 mug) in anesthetized rats was analyzed. This response was significantly reduced by the intravenous (i.v.) injection of guanethidine (5 mg), hexamethonium (10 mg) or phentolamine (5 mg), and conversely, potentiated by i.v. desmethylimipramine (0.3 mg), while propranolol (0.5 mg) i.v. selectively inhibited the enlargement of pulse pressure and the tachycardia following i.c. carbachol (1 mug). On the other hand, the pressor response to i.c. carbachol (1 mug) was almost completely blocked by i.c. atropine (3 mug) or hexamethonium (500 mug), and significantly reduced by i.c. chlorpromazine (50 mug) but significantly potentiated by i.c. desmethylimipramine (30 mug). The pressor response to i.c. carbachol (1 mug) remained unchanged after sectioning of the bilateral cervical vagal nerves but disappeared after sectioning of the spinal cord (C7-C8). From the above result it is suggested that the pressor response to i.c. carbachol ortral and peripheral adrenergic mechanisms, and that the sympathetic trunk is the main pathway.
The pro-alpha3(V) collagen chain. Complete primary structure, expression domains in adult and developing tissues, and comparison to the structures and expression domains of the other types V and XI procollagen chains.
The product of the ataxia-telangiectasia gene (ATM) was identified by using an antiserum developed to a peptide corresponding to the deduced amino acid sequence. The ATM protein is a single, high-molecular weight protein predominantly confined to the nucleus of human fibroblasts, but is present in both nuclear and microsomal fractions from human lymphoblast cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. ATM protein levels and localization remain constant throughout all stages of the cell cycle. Truncated ATM protein was not detected in lymphoblasts from ataxia-telangiectasia patients homozygous for mutations leading to premature protein termination. Exposure of normal human cells to gamma-irradiation and the radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin had no effect on ATM protein levels, in contrast to a noted rise in p53 levels over the same time interval. These findings are consistent with a role for the ATM protein in ensuring the fidelity of DNA repair and cell cycle regulation following genome damage..
The proline-rich gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2 are the founding members of a family of vitamin K-dependent single-pass integral membrane proteins characterized by an extracellular amino terminal domain of approximately 45 amino acids that is rich in Gla. The intracellular carboxyl terminal region of these two proteins contains one or two copies of the sequence PPXY, a motif present in a variety of proteins involved in such diverse cellular functions as signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and protein turnover. In this report, we describe the cloning of the cDNAs for two additional human transmembrane Gla proteins (TMG) of 20-24 kDa named TMG3 and TMG4. These two proteins possess extracellular Gla domains with 13 or 9 potential Gla residues, respectively, followed by membrane-spanning hydrophobic regions and cytoplasmic carboxyl terminal regions that contain PPXY motifs. This emerging family of integral membrane Gla proteins includes proline-rich Gla protein (PRGP) 1, PRGP2, TMG3, and TMG4, all of which are characterized by broad and variable distribution in both fetal and adult tissues. Members of this family can be grouped into two subclasses on the basis of their gene organization and amino acid sequence. These observations suggest novel physiological functions for vitamin K beyond its known role in the biosynthesis of proteins involved in blood coagulation and bone development. The identification and characterization of these proteins may allow a more complete understanding of the teratogenic consequences of exposure in utero to vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin-based anticoagulants.
The protective effect of oral administration of the thiol compound sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulphonate (MESNA) against urothelial toxicity induced by ifosfamide (IF) was tested in a group of 45 patients with inoperable lung cancer under treatment with IF (2250 mg/m2 on days 2-5) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen repeated in a 4-week cycle. MESNA was given orally on the days of treatment with IF in 3 doses of 840 mg/m2, each administered at 0 hr (= injection of IF), 4 hr and 8 hr p.i. Out of a total of 88 courses of this treatment we observed 10 episodes of asymptomatic microscopic haematuria and no episodes of gross haematuria. In this group of 45 patients under protection with MESNA there were 5 complete remissions and 9 partial remissions (total 31%). A further group of 25 patients under polychemotherapy with IF were treated by conventional prophylactic measures (raised fluid intake and forced diuresis). In this group there were 1 complete and 5 partial remissions (total 24%), but nearly all patients developed either gross haematuria and/or symptoms of bladder irritation (cystitis and pollakisuria). There were no appreciable differences between the MESNA series and the conventional prophylaxis series with respect to either haematological or systemic toxicity of the cytostatic treatment. Our results support the view that MESNA, given orally in conjunction with combined cytostatic regimens which include IF, simplifies the treatment and provides optimum protection for the urinary epithelium. Protection with oral MESNA is particularly suitable for outpatients.
The protective role of Nrf2 in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy.
The protein deficient in Lowe syndrome is a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase.
The proteolipid protein gene (PLP) is normally present at chromosome Xq22. Mutations and duplications of this gene are associated with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). Here we describe two new families in which males affected with PMD were found to have a copy of PLP on the short arm of the X chromosome, in addition to a normal copy on Xq22. In the first family, the extra copy was first detected by the presence of heterozygosity of the AhaII dimorphism within the PLP gene. The results of FISH analysis showed an additional copy of PLP in Xp22. 1, although no chromosomal rearrangements could be detected by standard karyotype analysis. Another three affected males from the family had similar findings. In a second unrelated family with signs of PMD, cytogenetic analysis showed a pericentric inversion of the X chromosome. In the inv (X) carried by several affected family members, FISH showed PLP signals at Xp11. 4 and Xq22. A third family has previously been reported, in which affected members had an extra copy of the PLP gene detected at Xq26 in a chromosome with an otherwise normal banding pattern. The identification of three separate families in which PLP is duplicated at a noncontiguous site suggests that such duplications could be a relatively common but previously undetected cause of genetic disorders.
The proto-oncogenes of the myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) family, including MYC, MYCN and MYCL, encode nuclear proteins that act as transcription factors. The Myc protein is the best studied member of this family and is involved in cell cycle regulation, differentiation and cell death. We have previously demonstrated that the zinc-finger protein Yaf2 interacts with the central region of MycN and enhances MycN dependent transcriptional activation. Here we show that Yaf2 also binds to the Myc protein in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to the activating effect on MycN function, Yaf2 inhibits Myc mediated transactivation and transformation. This differential influence on two members of the Myc family gives insight into a new mechanism to modulate the biological activities of Myc transcription factors.
The purpose of the present study was to compare influence of central arginine vasopressin (AVP) and of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on control of arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in normotensive (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. Three series of experiments were performed on 30 WKY and 30 SHR, chronically instrumented with guide tubes in the lateral ventricle (LV) and arterial and venous catheters. MAP and HR were monitored before and after i.v. injections of either vehicle or 1, 10 and 50 ng of AVP and 25, 125 and 500 ng of ANP. Sensitivity of cardiac component of baroreflex (CCB), expressed as a slope of the regression line was determined from relationships between systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and HR period (HRp) during phenylephrine (Phe)-induced hypertension and sodium nitroprusside (SN)-induced hypotension. CCB was measured before and after administration of either vehicle, AVP, ANP, or both peptides together. Increases of MAP occurred after LV administration of 1, 10 and 50 ng of AVP in WKY and of 10 and 50 ng in SHR. ANP did not cause significant changes in MAP in both strains as compared to vehicle, but it abolished AVP-induced MAP increase in WKY and SHR. CCB was reduced in WKY and SHR after LV administration of AVP during SN-induced hypotension. In SHR but not in WKY administration of ANP, AVP and ANP + AVP decreased CCB during Phe-induced MAP elevation. The results indicate that centrally applied AVP and ANP exert differential effects on blood pressure and baroreflex control of heart rate in WKY and SHR and suggest interaction of these two peptides in blood pressure regulation at the level of central nervous system.
The purpose of the present study was to determine if elevated reactive oxygen (ROS)/nitrogen species (RNS) reported to be present in adriamycin (ADR)-induced cardiotoxicity actually resulted in cardiomyocyte oxidative/nitrative damage, and to quantitatively determine the time course and subcellular localization of these postulated damage products using an in vivo approach. B6C3 mice were treated with a single dose of 20 mg/kg ADR. Ultrastructural damage and levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE)-protein adducts and 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) were analyzed. Quantitative ultrastructural damage using computerized image techniques showed cardiomyocyte injury as early as 3 hours, with mitochondria being the most extensively and progressively injured subcellular organelle. Analysis of 4HNE protein adducts by immunogold electron microscopy showed appearance of 4HNE protein adducts in mitochondria as early as 3 hours, with a peak at 6 hours and subsequent decline at 24 hours. 3NT levels were significantly increased in all subcellular compartments at 6 hours and subsequently declined at 24 hours. Our data showed ADR induced 4HNE-protein adducts in mitochondria at the same time point as when mitochondrial injury initially appeared. These results document for the first time in vivo that mitochondrial oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage. The progressive nature of mitochondrial injury suggests that mitochondria, not other subcellular organelles, are the major site of intracellular injury.
The purpose of the present study was to determine whether chronic administration of temocapril, a long-acting non-SH group angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduced proteinuria, inhibited glomerular hypertrophy and prevented glomerulosclerosis in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) - induced nephrotic rats. Nephrosis was induced by injection of PAN (15mg/100g body weight) in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Four groups were used, i) the PAN group (14), ii) PAN/temocapril (13), iii) temocapril (14) and iv) untreated controls (15). Temocapril (8 mg/kg/day) was administered to the rats which were killed at weeks 4, 14 or 20. At each time point, systolic blood pressure (BP), urinary protein excretion and renal histopathological findings were evaluated, and morphometric image analysis was done. Systolic BP in the PAN group was significantly high at 4, 14 and 20 weeks, but was normal in the PAN/temocapril group. Urinary protein excretion in the PAN group increased significantly, peaking at 8 days, then decreased at 4 weeks, but rose again significantly at 14 and 20 weeks. Temocapril did not attenuate proteinuria at 8 days, but it did markedly lower it from weeks 4 to 20. The glomerulosclerosis index (GSI) was 6.21 % at 4 weeks and respectively 25.35 % and 30.49 % at 14 and 20 weeks in the PAN group. There was a significant correlation between urinary protein excretion and GSI (r = 0.808, p < 0.0001). The ratio of glomerular tuft area to the area of Bowman's capsules (GT/BC) in the PAN group was significantly increased, but it was significantly lower in the PAN/temocapril group. It appears that temocapril was effective in retarding renal progression and protected renal function in PAN neprotic rats.
The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of furosemide in addition to intravenous fluids in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy. 18 patients, referred to a radiocontrast study, considered at risk because of preexisting renal insufficiency, were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, performed at the secondary care center of a 1,100-bed private university hospital. In addition to fluids, the treatment group received furosemide (mean dose 110 mg) intravenously 30 min prior to the injection of contrast material. The control group received fluids (mean 3 liters). Radiological studies were mostly angiographies performed with both ionic and non-ionic contrast material, at an average dose of 245 ml. Renal function significantly deteriorated in the group pretreated with furosemide (p < 0.005 by ANOVA), with a rise in serum creatinine from 145 +/- 13 to 182 +/- 16 mumol/l at 24 h, while no change occurred in the control group (from 141 +/- 6 to 142 +/- 7 mumol/l). Renal failure was associated with weight loss in the furosemide-treated group. Furosemide may be deleterious in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy.
The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the neurotoxicity of theophylline is altered in advanced pregnancy. Sprague-Dawley rats that were 20 days pregnant and nonpregnant rats of the same age and strain received infusions of aminophylline until onset of maximal seizures which occurred after 28 and 30 minutes respectively. Theophylline concentrations at this endpoint in serum (total) and CSF were similar but serum (free) and brain concentrations were slightly different in pregnant rats. Theophylline serum protein binding determined by equilibrium dialysis was lower in pregnant rats. Fetal serum concentrations at onset of seizures in the mother were similar to maternal brain and CSF concentrations and correlated significantly with the former. It is concluded that advanced pregnancy has a negligible effect on the neurotoxic response to theophylline in rats.
The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound. A Tween 80-coated poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system, able to trespass the BBB. Tacrine, administered in LiCl pre-treated rats, induces electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal damage. The toxic effects of tacrine-loaded poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles (5mg/kg), a saline solution of tacrine (5mg/kg) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i.p. administration in LiCl-pre-treated Wistar rats. All the animals treated with tacrine-loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms, i.e. epileptic onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min vs. 22 min respectively). In addition, tacrine-loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60% of animals. Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control (saline-treated) group of animals. In conclusion, the evaluation of time-to-onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine-lithium model of epilepsy in the rat, could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass (or not) the BBB in vivo.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neurologic consequences of deliberate subarachnoid injection of large volumes of 2-chloroprocaine-CE in experimental animals. The possible role of low pH as well as total volume as potential factors in causing neurotoxicity was evaluated. The 65 dogs in the study received injections in the subarachnoid space as follows: 6 to 8 ml of bupivacaine (N = 15), 2-chloroprocaine-CE (N = 20), low pH normal saline (pH 3.0) (N = 20), or normal saline (N = 10). Of the 20 animals that received subarachnoid injection of 2-chloroprocaine-CE seven (35%) developed hind-limb paralysis. None of the animals that received bupivacaine, normal saline, or normal saline titrated to a pH 3.0 developed hind-limb paralysis. Of the 15 spinal cords of the animals that received 2-chloroprocaine-CE, 13 showed subpial necrosis; the nerve roots and subarachnoid vessels were normal. The spinal cords of the animals that received bupivacaine, low pH normal saline (pH 3.0), or normal saline did not show abnormal findings.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of calcium channel blockers on bupivacaine-induced acute toxicity. For each of the three tested calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil and bepridil) 6 groups of mice were treated by two different doses, i.e. 2 and 10 mg/kg/i.p., or an equal volume of saline for the control group (n = 20); 15 minutes later, all the animals were injected with a single 50 mg/kg/i.p. dose of bupivacaine. The convulsant activity, the time of latency to convulse and the mortality rate were assessed in each group. The local anesthetic-induced mortality was significantly increased by the three different calcium channel blockers. The convulsant activity of bupivacaine was not significantly modified but calcium channel blockers decreased the time of latency to obtain bupivacaine-induced convulsions; this effect was less pronounced with bepridil.
The puzzling linkage between genetic hemochromatosis and histocompatibility loci became even more so when the gene involved, HFE, was identified. Indeed, within the well defined, mainly peptide-binding, MHC class I family of molecules, HFE seems to perform an unusual yet essential function. As yet, our understanding of HFE function in iron homeostasis is only partial; an even more open question is its possible role in the immune system. To advance on both of these avenues, we report the deletion of HFE alpha1 and alpha2 putative ligand binding domains in vivo. HFE-deficient animals were analyzed for a comprehensive set of metabolic and immune parameters. Faithfully mimicking human hemochromatosis, mice homozygous for this deletion develop iron overload, characterized by a higher plasma iron content and a raised transferrin saturation as well as an elevated hepatic iron load. The primary defect could, indeed, be traced to an augmented duodenal iron absorption. In parallel, measurement of the gut mucosal iron content as well as iron regulatory proteins allows a more informed evaluation of various hypotheses regarding the precise role of HFE in iron homeostasis. Finally, an extensive phenotyping of primary and secondary lymphoid organs including the gut provides no compelling evidence for an obvious immune-linked function for HFE..
The rabbit syndrome is an extrapyramidal side effect associated with chronic neuroleptic therapy. Its occurrence in a patient being treated with imipramine is described, representing the first reported case of this syndrome in conjunction with antidepressants. Repeated cerebral perfusion SPECT scans revealed decreased basal ganglia perfusion while the movement disorder was present, and a return to normal perfusion when the rabbit syndrome resolved.
The rapid identification of mutations causing Tay-Sachs disease requires the capacity to readily screen the regions of the HEXA gene most likely to be affected by mutation. We have sequenced the portions of the introns flanking each of the 14 HEXA exons in order to specify oligonucleotide primers for the PCR-dependent amplification of each exon and splice-junction sequence. The amplified products were analyzed, by electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, for the presence of either heteroduplexes, derived from the annealing of normal and mutant DNA strands, or single-strand conformational polymorphisms (SSCP), derived from the renaturation of single-stranded DNA. Five novel mutations from Tay-Sachs disease patients were detected a 5-bp deletion of TCTCC in IVS-9; a 2-bp deletion of TG in exon 5; G78 to A, giving a stop codon in exon 1; G533 to T in exon 5, producing the third amino acid substitution detected at this site; and G to C at position 1 of IVS-2, expected to produce abnormal splicing. In addition, two mutations, (G1496 to A in exon 13 and a 4-bp insertion in exon 11) that have previously been reported were identified..
The rare diseases ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), caused by mutations in the ATM gene, and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), with mutations in the p95/nbs1 gene, share a variety of phenotypic abnormalities such as chromosomal instability, radiation sensitivity and defects in cell-cycle checkpoints in response to ionizing radiation. The ATM gene encodes a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic drugs, whereas p95/nbs1 is part of a protein complex that is involved in responses to DNA double-strand breaks. Here, because of the similarities between AT and NBS, we evaluated the functional interactions between ATM and p95/nbs1. Activation of the ATM kinase by ionizing radiation and induction of ATM-dependent responses in NBS cells indicated that p95/nbs1 may not be required for signalling to ATM after ionizing radiation. However, p95/nbs1 was phosphorylated on serine 343 in an ATM-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo after ionizing radiation. A p95/nbs1 construct mutated at the ATM phosphorylation site abrogated an S-phase checkpoint induced by ionizing radiation in normal cells and failed to compensate for this functional deficiency in NBS cells. These observations link ATM and p95/nbs1 in a common signalling pathway and provide an explanation for phenotypic similarities in these two diseases..
The recent discovery of sequences at the site of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene in humans has opened up the possibility of a detailed molecular analysis of the genes in humans and in related mammalian species. Until relatively recently, there was no obvious mouse model of this genetic disease for the development of therapeutic strategies. The identification of a mouse X-linked mutant showing muscular dystrophy, mdx, has provided a candidate mouse genetic homologue to the DMD locus; the relatively mild pathological features of mdx suggest it may have more in common with mutations of the Becker muscular dystrophy type at the same human locus, however. But the close genetic linkage of mdx to G6PD and Hprt on the mouse X chromosome, coupled with its comparatively mild pathology, have suggested that the mdx mutation may instead correspond to Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy which itself is closely linked to DNA markers at Xq28-qter in the region of G6PD on the human X chromosome. Using an interspecific mouse domesticus/spretus cross, segregating for a variety of markers on the mouse X chromosome, we have positioned on the mouse X chromosome sequences homologous to a DMD cDNA clone. These sequences map provocatively close to the mdx mutation and unexpectedly distant from sparse fur, spf, the mouse homologue of OTC (ornithine transcarbamylase) which is closely linked to DMD on the human X chromosome..
The recent isolation of the complete open reading frame of the choroideremia (CHM) gene and the characterization of the exon-intron boundaries has paved the way to mutation detection in patients with classical choroideremia. We have performed mutation screening in patients from 15 Danish and Swedish families by using Southern blot hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique. Causative mutations in the CHM gene were detected in at least 12 families, indicating that a substantial part of the mutations can be identified by this approach. In four of these families deletions of different sizes were found. Thus, in one patient, the deletion resulted in the absence of only one exon, while in another the deletion comprised the entire CHM gene. Mapping of the deletion endpoints in these four patients and in another 11 male patients with sizeable deletions enabled us to construct a very detailed map of intervals 2 and 3 of Xq21. In the remaining 11 Danish and Swedish families at least 8 causative mutations were found by PCR-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing. Interestingly, all CHM gene mutations detected thus far in choroideremia patients give rise to the introduction of a premature stop codon..
The recently cloned human breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, is located on human chromosome 17q21. We have isolated murine genomic clones containing Brca1 as a first step in generating a mouse model for the loss of BRCA1 function. A mouse genomic library was screened using probes corresponding to exon 11 of the human BRCA1 gene. Two overlapping mouse clones were identified that hybridized to human BRCA1 exons 9-12. Sequence analysis of 1. 4 kb of the region of these clones corresponding to part of human exon 11 revealed 72% nucleic acid identity but only 50% amino acid identity with the human gene. The longest of the mouse Brca1 genomic clones maps to chromosome 11D, as determined by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. The synteny to human chromosome 17 was confirmed by cohybridization with the mouse probe for the NF1-gene. This comparative study confirms that the relative location of the BRCA1 gene has been conserved between mice and humans.
The receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor.
The recessive autosomal disorder known as ICF syndrome (for immunodeficiency, centromere instability and facial anomalies; Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 242860) is characterized by variable reductions in serum immunoglobulin levels which cause most ICF patients to succumb to infectious diseases before adulthood. Mild facial anomalies include hypertelorism, low-set ears, epicanthal folds and macroglossia. The cytogenetic abnormalities in lymphocytes are exuberant: juxtacentromeric heterochromatin is greatly elongated and thread-like in metaphase chromosomes, which is associated with the formation of complex multiradiate chromosomes. The same juxtacentromeric regions are subject to persistent interphase self-associations and are extruded into nuclear blebs or micronuclei. Abnormalities are largely confined to tracts of classical satellites 2 and 3 at juxtacentromeric regions of chromosomes 1, 9 and 16. Classical satellite DNA is normally heavily methylated at cytosine residues, but in ICF syndrome it is almost completely unmethylated in all tissues. ICF syndrome is the only genetic disorder known to involve constitutive abnormalities of genomic methylation patterns. Here we show that five unrelated ICF patients have mutations in both alleles of the gene that encodes DNA methyltransferase 3B (refs 5, 6). Cytosine methylation is essential for the organization and stabilization of a specific type of heterochromatin, and this methylation appears to be carried out by an enzyme specialized for the purpose.
The reciprocal translocation t(1;3)(p36;q21) occurs in a subset of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is frequently characterized by trilineage dysplasia, in particular dysmegakaryocytopoiesis, and poor prognosis. Previously, the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) at 3q21 was identified within a 60-kilobase (kb) region centromeric to the BCR of 3q21q26 syndrome and that at 1p36.3 within a 90-kb region. In this study, genes were searched near the breakpoints at 1p36.3, and a novel gene was isolated that encoded a zinc finger protein with a PR domain, which is highly homologous to the MDS1/EVI1 gene. The novel gene, designated as MEL1 (MDS1/EVI1-like gene 1), with 1257 amino acid residues is 64% similar in nucleotide and 63% similar in amino acid sequences to MDS1/EVI1 with the same domain structure. The MEL1 gene is expressed in leukemia cells with t(1;3) but not in other cell lines or bone marrow, spleen, and fetal liver, suggesting that MEL1 is specifically in the t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive MDS/AML. On the basis of the positional relationship between the EVI1 and MEL1 genes in each translocation, it was suggested that both genes are transcriptionally activated by the translocation of the 3q21 region with the Ribophorin I gene. Because of the transcriptional activation of the EVI1 family genes in both t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive MDS/AML and 3q21q26 syndrome, it is suggested that they share a common molecular mechanism for the leukemogenic transformation of the cells.
The recreational use of cocaine is on the increase. The emergency nurse ought to be familiar with some of the cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use. In particular, the tendency of cocaine to produce chest pain ought to be in the mind of the emergency nurse when faced with a young victim of chest pain who is otherwise at low risk. The mechanism of chest pain related to cocaine use is discussed and treatment dilemmas are discussed. Finally, moral issues relating to the testing of potential cocaine users will be addressed.
The red-green visual pigment gene region in adrenoleukodystrophy.
The regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) plays a key role in the development and growth of cells. Here we report the cloning and functional expression of a highly calcium-selective channel localized on the human chromosome 7. The sequence of the new channel is structurally related to the gene product of the CaT1 protein cloned from rat duodenum and is therefore called CaT-like (CaT-L). CaT-L is expressed in locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic and androgen-insensitive prostatic lesions but is undetectable in healthy prostate tissue and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Additionally, CaT-L is expressed in normal placenta, exocrine pancreas, and salivary glands. New markers with well defined biological function that correlate with aberrant cell growth are needed for the molecular staging of cancer and to predict the clinical outcome. The human CaT-L channel represents a marker for prostate cancer progression and may serve as a target for therapeutic strategies.
The relationship between abnormal color vision and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) was investigated in 27 AMN patients and 31 age-matched controls by using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test. Twelve (44%) of 27 patients showed test scores significantly above normal. The axes of bipolarity determined by the testing differed widely between the patients with abnormal scores, compatible with the notion that different alterations in visual pigment genes occur in different AMN kindreds. These observations confirm our earlier impression that the frequency of abnormal color vision is increased in these kindreds, and it supports our contentions that (1) AMN (and its companion, adrenoleukodystrophy) are very closely linked to the visual pigment loci at Xq28 and (2) this proximity might provide the opportunity to observe contiguous gene defects..

The relationship of arthritis and sexual dysfunction was investigated among 169 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and spondyloarthropathy, 130 of whom were pair-matched to controls. Assessments of marital happiness and depressed mood were also made using the CES-D and the Azrin Marital Happiness Scale (AMHS). Sexual dysfunctions were found to be common among patients and controls, the majority in both groups reporting one or more dysfunctions. Impotence was more common among male patients than controls and was found to be associated with co-morbidity and the taking of methotrexate. Depressed mood was more common among patients and was associated with certain sexual difficulties, but not with impotence. Marital unhappiness, as indicated by AMHS scores, was not associated with arthritis but was associated with sexual dysfunction, sexual dissatisfaction and being female.
The relationship of the genes coding for HLA to those coding for properdin Factor B allotypes and for deficiency of the second component of complement (C2) was studied in families of patients with connective tissue disorders. Patients were selected because they were heterozygous or homozygous for C2 deficiency. 12 families with 15 matings informative for C2 deficiency were found. Of 57 informative meioses, two crossovers were noted between the C2 deficiency gene and the HLA-B gene, with a recombinant fraction of 0. 035. A lod score of 13 was calculated for linkage between C2 deficiency and HLA-B at a maximum likelihood value of the recombinant fraction of 0. 04. 18 families with 21 informative matings for both properdin Factor B allotype and HLA-B were found. Of 72 informative meioses, three recombinants were found, giving a recombinant fraction of 0. 042. A lod score of 16 between HLA-B and Factor B allotypes was calculated at a maximum likelihood value of the recombinant fraction of 0. 04. A crossover was shown to have occurred between genes for Factor B and HLA-D, in which HLA-D segregared with HLA-A and B. These studies suggest that the genes for Factor B and C2 deficiency are located outside those for HLA, that the order of genese is HLA-A, -B, -D, Factor B allotype, C2 deficiency, that the genes coding for C2 deficiency and Factor B allotypes are approximately 3--5 centimorgans from the HLA-A and HLA-B loci, and that the apparent lack of recombinants between the Factor B gene and C2 deficiency gene suggests that these two genes lie in close proximity to one another.
The renal function of 74 children with malignant mesenchymal tumors in complete remission and who have received the same ifosfamide chemotherapy protocol (International Society of Pediatric Oncology Malignant Mesenchymal Tumor Study 84 [SIOP MMT 84]) were studied 1 year after the completion of treatment. Total cumulative doses were 36 or 60 g/m2 of ifosfamide (six or 10 cycles of ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin [IVA]). None of them had received cisplatin chemotherapy. Ages ranged from 4 months to 17 years; 58 patients were males and 42 females. The most common primary tumor site was the head and neck. Renal function was investigated by measuring plasma and urinary electrolytes, glucosuria, proteinuria, aminoaciduria, urinary pH, osmolarity, creatinine clearance, phosphate tubular reabsorption, beta 2 microglobulinuria, and lysozymuria. Fifty-eight patients (78%) had normal renal tests, whereas 16 patients (22%) had renal abnormalities. Two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group: the first included four patients (5% of the total population) who developed major toxicity resulting in Fanconi's syndrome (TDFS); and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 microglobulinuria and low phosphate reabsorption. The remaining seven patients had isolated beta 2 microglobulinuria. Severe toxicity was correlated with the higher cumulative dose of 60 g/m2 of ifosfamide, a younger age (less than 2 1/2 years old), and a predominance of vesicoprostatic tumor involvement. This low percentage (5%) of TDFS must be evaluated with respect to the efficacy of ifosfamide in the treatment of mesenchymal tumors in children.
The renal pathology in a case of lithium-induced diabetes insipidus.
The results of segregation analyses in 75 families where the proband had ankylosing spondylitis, are presented. Of the 278 adult, living first degree relatives, approximately 85% cooperated in the study. Clinical and radiographical examinations were performed and HLA typing was conducted. The results were in agreement with our hypothesis that ankylosing spondylitis is part of a syndrome where different genetic factors interact. Such known factors are HLA B27 associated disease susceptibility, susceptibility to psoriatic arthropathy and susceptibility to entero-arthropathy. Radiographical sacro-iliitis was restricted to HLA B27 positive relatives, and was more frequently found in relatives to probands with psoriasis than in relatives to probands without psoriasis. Environmental factors (intestinal bacteria) are known to trigger the disease at least in some persons, and we have postulated that all or most of them have the predisposition to develop disease. Thus, the syndrome has a multifactorial etiology. The phenotypic expressions of the different genetic predispositions involved, include sacro-iliitis, psoriasis, acute anterior uveitis, peripheral arthropathy and inflammatory bowel disease. We suggest the descriptive name HEREDITARY MULTIFOCAL RELAPSING INFLAMMATION (HEMRI) for this syndrome. Ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthropathy and entero-arthropathy may be regarded as clinical sub-types of the syndrome..
The retinal degeneration mouse (gene symbol, rd) is an animal model for certain forms of human hereditary retinopathies. Recent findings of a nonsense mutation in the rd mouse PDE beta-subunit gene (Pdeb) prompted us to investigate the chromosome locations of the mouse and human genes. We have utilized backcross analysis in mice to verify and define more precisely the location of the Pdeb locus 6. 1 +/- 2. 3 cM distal of Mgsa on mouse chromosome 5. We have determined that the human gene (PDEB) maps to 4p16. 3, very close to the Huntington disease (HD) region. Analysis of the comparative map for mice and humans shows that the mouse homologue of the HD gene will reside on chromosome 5. Linkage of the mouse Pdeb locus with other homologues in the human 4p16. 3 region is maintained but gene order is not, suggesting at least three possible sites for the corresponding mouse HD gene.
The retinoblastoma-predisposition gene, RB1, segregates as an autosomal dominant trait with high (90%) penetrance. Certain families, however, show an unusual low-penetrance phenotype with many individuals being unaffected, unilaterally affected, or with evidence of spontaneously regressed tumors. We have used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and PCR sequencing to study two such families. Mutations were found in exon 20 of RB1 in both cases. In one family a C----T transition in codon 661 converts an arginine (CGG) to a tryptophan (TGG) codon. In this family, incomplete penetrance and mild phenotypic expression were observed in virtually all patients, possibly indicating that single amino acid changes may modify protein structure/function such that tumorigenesis is not inevitable. In the second family the mutation in codon 675 is a G----T transversion that converts a glutamine (GAA) to a stop (TAA) codon. However, this mutation also occurs near a potential cryptic splice acceptor site, raising the possibility of alternative splicing resulting in a less severely disrupted protein..
The risk and associated factors of methamphetamine psychosis in methamphetamine-dependent patients in Malaysia.
The risk of developing renal papillary necrosis or cancer of the renal pelvis, ureter or bladder associated with consumption of either phenacetin or paracetamol was calculated from data acquired by questionnaire from 381 cases and 808 controls. The risk of renal papillary necrosis was increased nearly 20-fold by consumption of phenacetin, which also increased the risk for cancer of the renal pelvis and bladder but not for ureteric cancer. By contrast, we were unable to substantiate an increased risk from paracetamol consumption for renal papillary necrosis or any of these cancers although there was a suggestion of an association with cancer of the ureter.

The role of HLA class II Antigens in the control of the immune response is determined not only by the genetic polymorphism of these molecules, but also by their density on the cell surface. It is therefore essential to identify the signals that modulate HLA Class II gene activity in normal and neoplastic cells. We have purified a cytokine (IK factor, 19 kDa) secreted by the leukemic cell line K562 and several cancer cells, which inhibits HLA Class II antigen induction by IFN-gamma. We produced specific mAbs which antagonize the biological effect of IK in colon carcinoma Colo 205 cells induced to express HLA-DR molecules by IFN-gamma. Moreover, in Colo 205, HLA-DR can also be induced by the protein synthesis inhibitor Cycloheximide (0.1 micrograms ml-1); and addition of IK factor almost completely abolishes HLA class II expression. We have also performed the cloning and the sequencing of a specific cDNA. This probe recognizes a 2.1 Kb mRNA in different cell types. The nucleotide sequence exhibits no homologies with known cytokines. IK gene localization shows that it maps on chromosome 2p15-p14. The transient transfection of the cDNA in COS cells induces the secretion of a biologically active 19 kDa protein which is recognized in Western blot by 1C5B11 blocking mAb. This paper reports the characterization of a new cytokine down-regulating HLA class II Antigens, whose analysis will help to better understand HLA class II gene regulation and the mechanism of escape from immunorecognition in cancer cells.
The role of cyclosporine (CSA) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of renal toxicity was evaluated in rats. Administration of 20 mg/kg/day CSA for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man. The combined administration of CSA and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a nephrotoxic potential, such as gentamicin (at therapeutic doses), amphothericin B and ketoconazole, which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients, did not aggravate the CSA induced toxicity in the rat model. Gentamicin at toxic doses, however, increased CSA nephrotoxicity. Thus, the nephrotoxicity induced by CSA has a different pathogenetic mechanism.
The role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery disease. Objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise. Both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by ST segment depression and angina. However, the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise. Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while epinephrine-induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product. These findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine, as may occur during states of emotional distress, has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion.

The role of the renin--angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure during halothane anesthesia and sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced hypotension was evaluated. Control rats received halothane anesthesia (1 MAC) for one hour, followed by SNP infusion, 40 microgram/kg/min, for 30 min, followed by a 30-min recovery period. A second group of rats was treated identically and, in addition, received an infusion of saralasin (a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II) throughout the experimental period. In each group, SNP infusion resulted in an initial decrease in blood pressure from 86 torr and 83 torr, respectively, to 48 torr. During the SNP infusion the control animals demonstrated a progressive increase in blood pressure to 61 torr, whereas the saralasin-treated animals showed no change. Following discontinuation of SNP, blood pressure in the control animals rebounded to 94 torr, as compared with 78 torr in the saralasin-treated rats. This study indicates that with stable halothane anesthesia, the partial recovery of blood pressure during SNP infusion and the post-SNP rebound of blood pressure can be completely blocked by saralasin. This demonstrates the participation of the renin--angiotensin system in antagonizing the combined hypotensive effects of halothane and SNP.
The role of vasopressin as a pressor agent to the hypertensive process was examined. Vasopressin plays a major role in the pathogenesis of DOCA-salt hypertension, since the elevation of blood pressure was not substantial in the rats with lithium-treated diabetes insipidus after DOCA-salt treatment. Administration of DDAVP which has antidiuretic action but minimal vasopressor effect failed to increase blood pressure to the levels observed after administration of AVP. Furthermore, the pressor action of vasopressin appears to be important in the development of this model of hypertension, since the enhanced pressor responsiveness to the hormone was observed in the initial stage of hypertension. Increased secretion of vasopressin from neurohypophysis also promotes the function of the hormone as a pathogenetic factor in hypertension. An unproportional release of vasopressin compared to plasma osmolality may be induced by the absence of an adjusting control of angiotensin II forming and receptor binding capacity for sodium balance in the brain. However, the role of vasopressin remains to be determined in human essential hypertension.
The safety and efficacy of combination N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (SC-48334) and zidovudine in patients with HIV-1 infection and 200-500 CD4 cells/mm3.
The safety and efficacy of total dose infusion (TDI) of iron dextran has been well documented. In 40% of treated patients, an arthralgia-myalgia syndrome develops. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, prospective study was to investigate whether intravenous (i.v.) administration of methylprednisolone (MP) prevents this complication. Sixty-five patients, 34 women and 31 men, ages 36 to 80 years, received either normal saline before and after TDI (group 1), 125 mg i.v. MP before and saline after TDI (group 2), or 125 mg i.v. MP before and after TDI (group 3). Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity. Fifty-eight percent of group 1 patients, 33% of group 2, and 26% of group 3 had reactions to TDI. The severity of reactions (minimal, mild, and moderate, respectively) was as follows: group 1--6, 6, and 2; group 2--1, 5, and 0; group 3--5, 1, and 0. Data were analyzed by the two-sided Fisher's exact test using 95% confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf. These data demonstrate that administration of MP before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the arthralgia-myalgia syndrome. We conclude that 125 mg i.v. MP should be given routinely before and after TDI of iron dextran.
The same heterozygous T - > C transition at nt 8567 of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) transcript was found in two unrelated patients with type IID von Willebrand disease, with no other apparent abnormality. In one family, both alleles were normal in the parents and one sister; thus, the mutation originated de novo in the proposita. The second patient also had asymptomatic parents who, however, were not available for study. The structural consequences of the identified mutation, resulting in the CyS2010 - > Arg substitution, were evaluated by expression of the vWF carboxyl-terminal domain containing residues 1366-2050. Insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing normal vWF sequence secreted a disulfide linked dimeric molecule with an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa before reduction, yielding a single band of 80 kDa after disulfide bond reduction. In contrast, cells expressing the mutant fragment secreted a monomeric molecule of apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa, which remained unchanged after reduction. We conclude that CyS2010 is essential for normal dimerization of vWF subunits through disulfide bonding of carboxyl-terminal domains and that a heterozygous mutation in the corresponding codon is responsible for defective multimer formation in type IID von Willebrand disease..
The selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist Ro4368554 restores memory performance in cholinergic and serotonergic models of memory deficiency in the rat.
The sequence of the ubiquitin protein is highly conserved between species and has facilitated the cloning of numerous ubiquitin-like proteins. In the present study, we report the cloning of the cDNA for human ubiquilin 3 (UBQLN3). The deduced amino acid sequence of UBQLN3 contains a UBQ domain (ubiquitin-like) in the amino terminus as well as two highly conserved domains found in several recently cloned ubiquitin-like proteins. One of these domains, termed the NP domain, is a highly conserved 93 amino acid region present in UBQLN3 and several ubiquitin-like proteins. The last conserved domain is the UBA domain (ubiquitin-associated) found in a variety of proteins of the ubiquination pathway. The human UBQLN3 gene was mapped to the 11p15 region of chromosome 11. Northern blot analysis of multiple human and mouse tissues demonstrated UBQLN3 mRNA expression specifically in testis.
The serum of a 29-year old woman with a recent episode of disseminated gonococcal infection and a history of meningococcal meningitis and arthritis as a child was found to lack serum hemolytic complement activity. The seventh component of complement (C7) was not detected by functional or immunochemical assays, whereas other components were normal by hemolytic and immunochemical assessment. Her fresh serum lacked complement-mediated bactericidal activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but the addition of fresh normal serum or purified C7 restored bactericidal activity as well as hemolytic activity. The absence of functional C7 activity could not be accounted for on the basis of an inhibitor. Opsonization and generation of chemotactic activity functioned normally. Complete absence of C7 was also found in one sibling who had the clinical syndrome of meningococcal meningitis and arthritis as a child and in this siblings clinically well eight-year-old son. HLA histocompatibility typing of the family members did not demonstrate evidence for genetic linkage of C7 deficiency with the major histocompatibility loci. This report represents the first cases of C7 deficiency associated with infectious complications and suggests that bactericidal activity may be important in host defense against bacteremic neisseria infections.
The serum of a 44-yr-old woman of French-Canadian descent having a B-27 positive ankylosing spondylitis was deficient in the seventh component of complement (C7) as determined by hemolytic and immunochemical methods. No inhibitor against C7 was detected, and the levels of all other complement components were normal. No deficiency in the opsonic activity of the serum was found, and the results of basic coagulation studies of the plasma were normal. On investigation of the patients family, two sisters were found to have the same deficiency but were otherwise in good health. The seven other siblings were heterozygous for C7 deficiency, while the paternal aunt had a normal C7 level. In the third generation, six children of the three homozygous sisters and five children of heterozygotes were available for testing. Studies of the HLA antigens in all the 22 subjects and in three spouses indicated no close linkage between the CM deficienty and the HLA system. In addition, the simultaneous occurrence of two hereditary complement deficiencies (C2 and C7) was discovered in one family of this remarkable kindred..
The serum response element (SRE) is a sequence required for transient transcriptional activation of genes in response to growth factors. We have isolated cDNA clones encoding serum response factor (SRF), a ubiquitous nuclear protein that binds to the SRE. The SRF gene is highly conserved through evolution, and in cultured cells its transcription is itself transiently increased following serum stimulation. A cDNA clone of SRF expressed in vitro generates protein that forms complexes indistinguishable from those formed with HeLa cell SRF, as judged by DNA binding specificity and the ability to promote SRE-dependent in vitro transcription. SRF binds DNA as a dimer, and the DNA binding/dimerization domain of the protein exhibits striking homology to two yeast regulatory proteins.
The serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase SGK1 was originally identified as a glucocorticoid-sensitive gene. Subsequently, the two homologous kinases SGK2 and SGK3 have been cloned, being products of distinct genes, which are differentially expressed and share 80% identity in amino acid sequence in their catalytic domains. While SGK1 has been shown to activate ion channels, including K(+) channels, the functions of SGK2 and SGK3 have not been examined. The present study was therefore performed to elucidate the effect of SGK1, SGK2, and SGK3 on electrical properties of renal epithelial cells. To this end human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were transfected with the kinases and ion-channel activity determined using the patch-clamp technique. In non-transfected cells and in cells transfected with the empty GFP construct a voltage-gated K(+) current was observed amounting to 303+/-19 pA ( n=13) and 299+/-29 pA ( n=23), respectively. Transfection with SGK1, SGK2 or SGK3 increased the voltage-gated K(+) current to 1056+/-152 pA ( n=17), 555+/-47 pA ( n=17), and 775+/-98 pA ( n=16), respectively. The K(+) current was fully blocked by 3 mM tetraethylammonium chloride and inhibited 45% by the Kv1 channel blocker margatoxin (10 nM). In dual electrode voltage-clamp experiments SGK isoforms up-regulated Kv1 voltage-gated K(+)channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The present observations thus reveal a powerful stimulating effect of all three isoforms of SGK on K(+) channels. Those effects may participate in regulation of epithelial transport, cell proliferation, and neuromuscular excitability.
The site of common side effects of sumatriptan.
The size of the (CAG)n repeat array in the 3' end of the MJD1 gene and the haplotype at a series of microsatellite markers surrounding the MJD1 gene were examined in a large cohort of Japanese and Caucasian subjects affected with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). Our data provide five novel observations. First, MJD is associated with expansion fo the array from the normal range of 14-37 repeats to 68-84 repeats in most Japanese and Caucasian subjects, but no subjects were observed with expansions intermediate in size between those of the normal and MJD affected groups. Second, the expanded allele associated with MJD displays inter-generational instability, particularly in male meioses, and this instability was associated with the clinical phenomenon of anticipation. Third, the size of the expanded allele is not only inversely correlated with the age-of-onset of MJD (r = -0.738, p < 0.001), but is also correlated with the frequency of other clinical features [e.g. pseudoexophthalmos and pyramidal signs were more frequent in subjects with large repeats (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 respectively)]. Fourth, the disease phenotype is significantly more severe and had an early age of onset (16 years) in a subject homozygous for the expanded allele, which contrasts with Huntington disease and suggests that the expanded allele in the MJD1 gene could exert its effect either by a dominant negative effect (putatively excluded in HD) or by a gain of function effect as proposed for HD. Finally, Japanese and Caucasian subjects affected with MJD share haplotypes at several markers surrounding the MJD1 gene, which are uncommon in the normal Japanese and Caucasian population, and which suggests the existence either of common founders in these populations or of chromosomes susceptible to pathologic expansion of the CAG repeat in the MJD1 gene.
The small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) gene is regarded as one of the candidates for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We describe two sibs with typical PWS presenting deletion of SNRPN detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Neither a cytogenetically detectable 15q12 deletion nor a deletion for the D15S11, D15S10, and GABRB3 cosmid probes were found in either patient. This implies a smaller deletion limited to the PWS critical region. FISH with a SNRPN probe will permit analysis of PWS patients with limited deletions not detectable with other probes..
The small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles containing H/ACA-type snoRNAs (H/ACA snoRNPs) are crucial trans-acting factors intervening in eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis. Most of these particles generate the site-specific pseudouridylation of rRNAs while a subset are required for 18S rRNA synthesis. To understand in detail how these particles carry out these functions, all of their protein components have to be characterized. For that purpose, we have affinity-purified complexes containing epitope-tagged Gar1p protein, previously shown to be part of H/ACA snoRNPs. Under the conditions used, three polypeptides of 65, 22 and 10 kDa apparent molecular weight specifically copurify with epitope-tagged Gar1p. The 22 and 10 kDa polypeptides were identified as Nhp2p and a novel protein we termed Nop10p, respectively. Both proteins are conserved, essential and present in the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus. Nhp2p and Nop10p are specifically associated with all H/ACA snoRNAs and are essential to the function of H/ACA snoRNPs. Cells lacking Nhp2p or Nop10p are impaired in global rRNA pseudouridylation and in the A1 and A2 cleavage steps of the pre-rRNA required for the synthesis of mature 18S rRNA. These phenotypes are probably a direct consequence of the instability of H/ACA snoRNAs and Gar1p observed in cells deprived of Nhp2p or Nop10p. Our results suggest that Nhp2p and Nop10p, together with Cbf5p, constitute the core of H/ACA snoRNPs.
The specific aim of this retrospective, observational study was to assess safety and efficacy of long-term (21 months/patient), open-label, gemfibrozil-lovastatin treatment in 80 patients with primary mixed hyperlipidemia (68% of whom had atherosclerotic vascular disease). Because ideal lipid targets were not reached (low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol less than 130 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol greater than 35 mg/dl, or total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol less than 4.5 mg/dl) with diet plus a single drug, gemfibrozil (1.2 g/day)-lovastatin (primarily 20 or 40 mg) treatment was given. Follow-up visits were scheduled with 2-drug therapy every 6 to 8 weeks, an average of 10.3 visits per patient, with 741 batteries of 6 liver function tests and 714 creatine phosphokinase levels measured. Only 1 of the 4,446 liver function tests (0.02%), a gamma glutamyl transferase, was greater than or equal to 3 times the upper normal limit. Of the 714 creatine phosphokinase levels, 9% were high; only 1 (0.1%) was greater than or equal to 3 times the upper normal limit. With 2-drug therapy, mean total cholesterol decreased 22% from 255 to 200 mg/dl, triglyceride levels decreased 35% from 236 to 154 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol decreased 26% from 176 to 131 mg/dl, and the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio decreased 24% from 7.1 to 5.4, all p less than or equal to 0.0001. Myositis, attributable to the drug combination and symptomatic enough to discontinue it, occurred in 3% of patients, and in 1% with concurrent high creatine phosphokinase (769 U/liter); no patients had rhabdomyolysis or myoglobinuria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The spectrum of RB1 germ-line mutations in hereditary retinoblastoma.
The spinocerebellar ataxia 3 locus (SCA3) for type I autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA type I), a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders, has been mapped to chromosome 14q32. 1 1. ADCA type I patients from families segregating SCA3 share clinical features in common with those with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), the gene of which maps to the same region. We show here that the disease gene segregating in each of three French ADCA type I kindreds and in a French family with neuropathological findings suggesting the ataxochoreic form of dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy carries an expanded CAG repeat sequence located at the same locus as that for MJD. Analysis of the mutation in these families shows a strong negative correlation between size of the expanded CAG repeat and age at onset of clinical disease. Instability of the expanded triplet repeat was not found to be affected by sex of the parent transmitting the mutation. Evidence was found for somatic and gonadal mosaicism for alleles carrying expanded trinucleotide repeats.
The stress-responsive p38 and JNK MAPK pathways regulate cell cycle and apoptosis. A human MAPKKK, MTK1 (= MEKK4), mediates activation of both p38 and JNK in response to environmental stresses. Using a yeast two-hybrid method, three related proteins, GADD45alpha (= GADD45), GADD45, (= MyD118), and GADD45gamma, were identified that bound to an N-terminal domain of MTK1. These proteins activated MTK1 kinase activity, both in vivo and in vitro. The GADD45-like genes are induced by environmental stresses, including MMS, UV, and gamma irradiation. Expression of the GADD45-like genes induces p38/JNK activation and apoptosis, which can be partially suppressed by coexpression of a dominant inhibitory MTK1 mutant protein. We propose that the GADD45-like proteins mediate activation of the p38/JNK pathway, via MTK1/ MEKK4, in response to environmental stresses.
The striated muscle sarcomeres are highly organized structures composed of actin (thin) and myosin (thick) filaments that slide past each other during contraction. The integrity of sarcomeres is controlled by a set of structural proteins, among which are titin, a giant molecule that contains several immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and associates with thin and thick filaments, and -actinin, an actin cross-linking protein. Mutations in several sarcomeric and sarcolemmal proteins have been shown to result in muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. On the other hand, the disease genes underlying several disease forms remain to be identified. Here we describe a novel 57 kDa cytoskeletal protein, myotilin. Its N-terminal sequence is unique, but the C-terminal half contains two Ig-like domains homologous to titin. Myotilin is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, it co-localizes with -actinin in the sarcomeric I--bands and directly interacts with -actinin. The human myotilin gene maps to chromosome 5q31 between markers AFM350yB1 and D5S500. The locus of a dominantly inherited limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD1A) resides in an overlapping narrow segment, and a new type of distal myopathy with vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness (VCPMD) has been mapped to the same locus. The muscle specificity and apparent role as a sarcomeric structural protein raise the possibility that defects in the myotilin gene may cause muscular dystrophy.
The striatum as a target for anti-rigor effects of an antagonist of mGluR1, but not an agonist of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors.
The study investigates if alpha-lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity, if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade, and if neuroprotective effects of alpha-lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protection. We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin, two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs. This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha-lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha-lipoic acid. Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons. Alpha-lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons: it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein with anti-oxidant and chaperone properties. In conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti-oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions, possibly inducing the expression of frataxin. These findings suggest that alpha-lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials.
The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of epileptic seizure activity. Additionally, in models of prolonged status epilepticus the pars reticulata of substantia nigra (SNR) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR. In this study, status epilepticus was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine in rats. The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time-course of changes in neurons and astrocytes. Animals surviving 20, 30, 40, 60 min, 2, 3, 6 hours, 1, 2, and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion-fixed, and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR. Nissl-staining and antibodies against the neuron-specific calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin, served to detect neuronal damage in SNR. Antibodies against the astroglia-specific cytoskeletal protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and against the glial calcium-binding protein, S-100 protein, were used to assess the status of astrocytes. Immunohistochemical staining for serum-albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood-brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation. Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP-staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects. At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S-100 protein staining. By 2 hours, parvalbumin-staining changed in the central SNR indicating neuronal damage, and Nissl-staining visualized some neuronal distortion. Staining for serum-proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours. By 6 h, vasogenic edema covered the lesioned SNR. By 24 h, glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR. By 48-72 h, astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size, and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area. In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days, conventional paraffin-sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of SNR. Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus. Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR. Both cell elements may suffer in common from metabolic disturbance and neurotransmitter dysfunction as occur during massive status epilepticus.
The survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein is the product of the gene mutated or deleted in the neurodegenerative disease, spinal muscular atrophy. SMN is part of a large macromolecular complex that also contains Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin4, Gemin5, and Gemin6. The SMN complex functions in the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and probably other ribonucleoprotein particles. We have identified a novel protein component of the SMN complex termed Gemin7 using native purified SMN complexes and peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunolocalization experiments demonstrate that Gemin7 is a component of the SMN complex and colocalizes with SMN in the cytoplasm and in gems. Binding experiments show that Gemin7 interacts directly with SMN and Gemin6 and mediates the association of Gemin6 with the SMN complex. The amino acid sequence of Gemin7 does not contain any recognizable motifs with the exception of several arginine and glycine repeats that are necessary for its interaction with SMN. Moreover, Gemin7 interacts with several Sm proteins of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, in particular, with SmE. With the identification of Gemin7, the inventory of the core components of the SMN complex appears essentially complete.
The systolic pressure variation (SPV), which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) after one positive-pressure breath, was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to hypotension. Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage (HEM, n = 7) or by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, n = 7). During HEM-induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the SNP group. The systemic, central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and heart rates, were similar in the two groups. Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups. The SPV during hypotension was 15.7 +/- 6.7 mm Hg in the HEM group, compared with 9.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg in the SNP group (P less than 0.02). The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20.3 +/- 8.4 and 10.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg in the HEM and SNP groups, respectively, during hypotension (P less than 0.02). It is concluded that increases in the SPV and the delta down are characteristic of a hypotensive state due to a predominant decrease in preload. They are thus more important during absolute hypovolemia than during deliberate hypotension.
The t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) chromosomal translocation commonly found in synovial sarcomas fuses the SYT gene on chromosome 18 to either of two similar genes, SSX1 or SSX2, on the X chromosome. The SYT protein appears to act as a transcriptional co-activator and the SSX proteins as co-repressors. Here we have investigated the functional domains of the proteins. The SYT protein has a novel conserved 54 amino acid domain at the N-terminus of the protein (the SNH domain) which is found in proteins from a wide variety of species, and a C-terminal domain, rich in glutamine, proline, glycine and tyrosine (the QPGY domain), which contains the transcriptional activator sequences. Deletion of the SNH domain results in a more active transcriptional activator, suggesting that this domain acts as an inhibitor of the activation domain. The C-terminal SSX domain present in SYT-SSX translocation protein contributes a transcriptional repressor domain to the protein. Thus, the fusion protein has transcriptional activating and repressing domains. We demonstrate that the human homologue of the SNF2/Brahama protein BRM co-localizes with SYT and SYT-SSX in nuclear speckles, and also interacts with SYT and SYT-SSX proteins in vitro. This interaction may provide an explanation of how the SYT protein activates gene transcription.
The tectorial membrane is an extracellular matrix of the inner ear that contacts the stereocilia bundles of specialized sensory hair cells. Sound induces movement of these hair cells relative to the tectorial membrane, deflects the stereocilia, and leads to fluctuations in hair-cell membrane potential, transducing sound into electrical signals. Alpha-tectorin is one of the major non-collagenous components of the tectorial membrane. Recently, the gene encoding mouse alpha-tectorin (Tecta) was mapped to a region of mouse chromosome 9, which shows evolutionary conservation with human chromosome 11q (ref. 3), where linkage was found in two families, one Belgian (DFNA12; ref. 4) and the other, Austrian (DFNA8; unpublished data), with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment. We determined the complete sequence and the intron-exon structure of the human TECTA gene. In both families, mutation analysis revealed missense mutations which replace conserved amino-acid residues within the zona pellucida domain of TECTA. These findings indicate that mutations in TECTA are responsible for hearing impairment in these families, and implicate a new type of protein in the pathogenesis of hearing impairment.
The telomeric poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, tankyrase 1, contains multiple binding sites for telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1) and a novel acceptor, 182-kDa tankyrase-binding protein (TAB182).
The three human TACC (transforming acidic coiled-coil) genes encode a family of proteins with poorly defined functions that are suspected to play a role in oncogenesis. A Xenopus TACC homolog called Maskin is involved in translational control, while Drosophila D-TACC interacts with the microtubule-associated protein MSPS (Mini SPindleS) to ensure proper dynamics of spindle pole microtubules during cell division. We have delineated here the interactions of TACC1 with four proteins, namely the microtubule-associated chTOG (colonic and hepatic tumor-overexpressed gene) protein (ortholog of Drosophila MSPS), the adaptor protein TRAP (tudor repeat associator with PCTAIRE2), the mitotic serine/threonine kinase Aurora A and the mRNA regulator LSM7 (Like-Sm protein 7). To measure the relevance of the TACC1-associated complex in human cancer we have examined the expression of the three TACC, chTOG and Aurora A in breast cancer using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. We show that expressions of TACC1, TACC2, TACC3 and Aurora A are significantly correlated and downregulated in a subset of breast tumors. Using siRNAs, we further show that depletion of chTOG and, to a lesser extent of TACC1, perturbates cell division. We propose that TACC proteins, which we also named 'Taxins', control mRNA translation and cell division in conjunction with microtubule organization and in association with chTOG and Aurora A, and that these complexes and cell processes may be affected during mammary gland oncogenesis.
The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) regulates the expression of target genes upon binding to triiodothyronine (T3) response elements. In the presence of T3, the TR recruits coactivating proteins that both modulate and integrate the ligand response. We report here the cloning of a novel protein using the TR ligand-binding domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Analysis of a putative full-length clone demonstrates a cDNA sequence that encodes a protein of 920 amino acids with a size of 120 kDa (p120). Alignment with known sequences shows homology to a previously identified protein of unknown function, termed skeletal muscle abundant protein. Interaction studies demonstrate that p120 interacts with the TR AF-2 domain in the presence of ligand through a 111-amino acid region. Northern analysis demonstrates widespread expression in human tissues. Cotransfection assays in CV-1 cells demonstrate that p120 enhances TR-mediated transactivation on multiple T3 response elements in the presence of T3. In addition, CREB-binding protein synergizes with p120 to enhance this effect. When linked to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, p120 is an activator of transcription alone. Thus, p120 satisfies a number of important criteria as a nuclear receptor coactivator.
The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), a member of the large family of G protein-coupled receptors, controls both the function and growth of thyroid cells via stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. We report two different mutations in the TSHR gene of affected members of two large pedigrees with non-autoimmune autosomal dominant hyperthyroidism (toxic thyroid hyperplasia), that involve residues in the third (Val509Ala) and seventh (Cys672Tyr) transmembrane segments. When expressed by transfection in COS-7 cells, the mutated receptors display a higher constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase than wild type. This new disease entity is the germline counterpart of hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas, in which different somatic mutations with similar functional characteristics have been demonstrated.
The time course and concentration-effect relationship of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia was studied, using computer-aided pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling. Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of oxprenolol in antagonizing such hypokalemia, together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs. Six healthy subjects were given a 0.5 mg subcutaneous dose of terbutaline on two occasions: 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after 80 mg oxprenolol orally. In the 7-hour period after terbutaline administration, plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma potassium levels and drug concentrations. The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between terbutaline concentrations and potassium effects. Oxprenolol caused decreases of 65% and 56% of terbutaline volume of distribution and clearance, respectively, and an increase of 130% of its AUC. In spite of higher terbutaline concentrations after oxprenolol pretreatment, the hypokalemia was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2-blocking action.
The toxicity of Renografin 76% was compared with that of Hypaque 76% by selective injection of each into the right coronary artery of dogs. Renografin contains the chelating agents sodium citrate and disodium edetate, while Hypaque contains calcium disodium edetate and no sodium citrate. Ventricular fibrillation occurred significantly more often with Renografin, suggesting that chelating agents contribute to toxicity in coronary angiography.
The transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-6 is an upstream regulator of several genes involved in the pathogenesis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young. We therefore tested the hypothesis that variability in the HNF-6 gene is associated with subsets of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and estimates of insulin secretion in glucose tolerant subjects. We cloned the coding region as well as the intron-exon boundaries of the HNF-6 gene. We then examined them on genomic DNA in six MODY probands without mutations in the MODY1, MODY3 and MODY4 genes and in 54 patients with late-onset Type II diabetes by combined single strand conformational polymorphism-heteroduplex analysis followed by direct sequencing of identified variants. An identified missense variant was examined in association studies and genotype-phenotype studies. We identified two silent and one missense (Pro75 Ala) variant. In an association study the allelic frequency of the Pro75Ala polymorphism was 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.5) in 330 patients with Type II diabetes mellitus compared with 4.2% (2.4-6.0) in 238 age-matched glucose tolerant control subjects. Moreover, in studies of 238 middle-aged glucose tolerant subjects, of 226 glucose tolerant offspring of Type II diabetic patients and of 367 young healthy subjects, the carriers of the polymorphism did not differ from non-carriers in glucose induced serum insulin or C-peptide responses. Mutations in the coding region of the HNF-6 gene are not associated with Type II diabetes or with changes in insulin responses to glucose among the Caucasians examined.
The transduction of a human placental cDNA retroviral library into glyB cells, a Chinese hamster ovary K1 subline that is deficient in the transport of folates into mitochondria, resulted in the complementation of glycine auxotrophy of these cells. A 2.6-kilobase pair cDNA insert flanked by retroviral sequences had integrated into genomic DNA in rescued cells. An open reading frame in this cDNA encoded a 35-kDa protein homologous to several inner mitochondrial wall transporters for intermediate metabolites. The subcloned cDNA complemented the glycine auxotrophy of glyB cells and reinstated folate accumulation in the mitochondria of transfected cells. The human origin, chromosomal location, and intron-exon organization of the isolated mitochondrial folate transporter gene were deduced from the expressed sequence tag database and human genome project data.
The treatment regimens are described in 74 patients with endometrial disease among 850 climacteric women receiving oestrogen therapy. Cystic hyperplasia was associated with unopposed oestrogen therapy without progestagen. Two courses of 21 days of 5 mg norethisterone daily caused reversion to normal in all 57 cases of cystic hyperplasia and 6 of the 8 cases of atypical hyperplasia. 4 cases of endometrial carcinoma referred from elsewhere demonstrated the problems of inappropriate and unsupervised unopposed oestrogen therapy and the difficulty in distinguishing severe hyperplasia from malignancy. Cyclical low-dose oestrogen therapy with 7--13 days of progestagen does not seem to increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma.
The trinucleotide expansion mutation causing myotonic dystrophy is in the 3 untranslated region of a protein kinase gene. The molecular mechanisms by which the expanded repeat causes the clinically variable and multisystemic disease, myotonic dystrophy, are not understood. It has been particularly difficult to rationalize the dominant inheritance with the fact that the expansion mutation lies outside of the protein-encoding gene elements, and should not be translated into protein. Here we use muscle biopsies from classical adult-onset myotonic dystrophy patients to study the accumulation of transcripts from both the normal and expanded DM kinase genes in patient muscle, and compare the results to normal and myopathic controls. We found relatively small decreases of DM kinase RNA in the total RNA pool from muscle; however, these reductions were not disease specific. Analysis of poly (A) + RNA showed dramatic decreases of both the mutant and normal DM kinase RNAs, and these changes were disease-specific. Our findings are consistent with a novel molecular pathogenetic mechanism for myotonic dystrophy both the normal and expanded DM kinase genes are transcribed in patient muscle, but the abnormal expansion-containing RNA has a dominant effect on RNA metabolism by preventing the accumulation of poly (A) + RNA. The ability of the expansion mutation to alter accumulation of poly (A) + RNA in trans suggests that myotonic dystrophy may be the first example of a dominant-negative mutation manifested at the RNA level..
The tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) system is known to inhibit prolactin (PRL) secretion. In young animals this system responds to acute elevations in serum PRL by increasing its activity. However, this responsiveness is lost in aging rats with chronically high serum PRL levels. The purpose of this study was to induce hyperprolactinemia in rats for extended periods of time and examine its effects on dopaminergic systems in the brain. Hyperprolactinemia was induced by treatment with haloperidol, a dopamine receptor antagonist, and Palkovits' microdissection technique in combination with high-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure neurotransmitter concentrations in several areas of the brain. After 6 months of hyperprolactinemia, dopamine (DA) concentrations in the median eminence (ME) increased by 84% over the control group. Nine months of hyperprolactinemia produced a 50% increase in DA concentrations in the ME over the control group. However, DA response was lost if a 9-month long haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia was followed by a 1 1/2 month-long extremely high increase in serum PRL levels produced by implantation of MMQ cells under the kidney capsule. There was no change in the levels of DA, norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), or their metabolites in the arcuate nucleus (AN), medial preoptic area (MPA), caudate putamen (CP), substantia nigra (SN), and zona incerta (ZI), except for a decrease in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the AN after 6-months of hyperprolactinemia and an increase in DA concentrations in the AN after 9-months of hyperprolactinemia. These results demonstrate that hyperprolactinemia specifically affects TIDA neurons and these effects vary, depending on the duration and intensity of hyperprolactinemia. The age-related decrease in hypothalamic dopamine function may be associated with increases in PRL secretion.
The tumor suppressor gene Brca1 is required for embryonic cellular proliferation in the mouse.
The tumor suppressor gene Smad4/Dpc4 is required for gastrulation and later for anterior development of the mouse embryo.
The tumour suppressor gene PTEN, which maps to 10q23. 3 and encodes a 403 amino acid dual specificity phosphatase (protein tyrosine phosphatase; PTPase), was shown recently to play a broad role in human malignancy. Somatic PTEN deletions and mutations were observed in sporadic breast, brain, prostate and kidney cancer cell lines and in several primary tumours such as endometrial carcinomas, malignant melanoma and thyroid tumours. In addition, PTEN was identified as the susceptibility gene for two hamartoma syndromes Cowden disease (CD; MIM 158350) and Bannayan-Zonana (BZS) or Ruvalcaba-Riley-Smith syndrome (MIM 153480). Constitutive DNA from 37 CD families and seven BZS families was screened for germline PTEN mutations. PTEN mutations were identified in 30 of 37 (81%) CD families, including missense and nonsense point mutations, deletions, insertions, a deletion/insertion and splice site mutations. These mutations were scattered over the entire length of PTEN, with the exception of the first, fourth and last exons. A hot spot for PTEN mutation in CD was identified in exon 5 that contains the PTPase core motif, with 13 of 30 (43%) CD mutations identified in this exon. Seven of 30 (23%) were within the core motif, the majority (five of seven) of which were missense mutations, possibly pointing to the functional significance of this region. Germline PTEN mutations were identified in four of seven (57%) BZS families studied. Interestingly, none of these mutations was observed in the PTPase core motif. It is also worthy of note that a single nonsense point mutation, R233X, was observed in the germline DNA from two unrelated CD families and one BZS family. Genotype-phenotype studies were not performed on this small group of BZS families. However, genotype-phenotype analysis inthe group of CD families revealed two possible associations worthy of follow-up in independent analyses. The first was an association noted in the group of CD families with breast disease. A correlation was observed between the presence/absence of a PTEN mutation and the type of breast involvement (unaffected versus benign versus malignant). Specifically and more directly, an association was also observed between the presence of a PTEN mutation and malignant breast disease. Secondly, there appeared to be an interdependent association between mutations upstream and within the PTPase core motif, the core motif containing the majority of missense mutations, and the involvement of all major organ systems (central nervous system, thyroid, breast, skin and gastrointestinal tract). However, these observations would need to be confirmed by studying a larger number of CD families.
The type of somatic mutation at APC in familial adenomatous polyposis is determined by the site of the germline mutation: a new facet to Knudson's 'two-hit' hypothesis.
The ubiquitously expressed pICln protein forms homomeric complexes in vitro.
The underlying DNA changes associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) -deficient Asians have not been extensively investigated. To fill this gap, we sequenced the G6PD gene of 43 G6PD-deficient Chinese whose G6PD was well characterized biochemically. DNA samples were obtained from peripheral blood of these individuals for sequencing using a direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing procedure. From these 43 samples, we have identified five different types of nucleotide substitutions in the G6PD gene at cDNA 1388 from G to A (Arg to His); at cDNA 1376 from G to T (Arg to Leu); at cDNA 1024 from C to T (Leu to Phe); at cDNA 392 from G to T (Gly to Val); at cDNA 95 from A to G (His to Arg). These five nucleotide substitutions account for over 83% of our 43 G6PD-deficient samples and these substitutions have not been reported in non-Asians. The substitutions found at cDNA 392 and cDNA 1024 are new findings. The substitutions at cDNA 1376 and 1388 account for over 50% of the 43 samples examined indicating a high prevalence of these two alleles among G6PD-deficient Chinese. Our findings add support to the notion that diverse point mutations may account largely for much of the phenotypic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency..
The use and toxicity of didanosine (ddI) in HIV antibody-positive individuals intolerant to zidovudine (AZT)
The use of adriamycin (ADR) in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular toxicity. Earlier observations that ADR interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ADR's action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb-c mice i.p. treated with ADR for several weeks. At various times during treatment, the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy. In parallel, total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady-state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII, COXIII, and COXIV genes. Similarly, samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies. Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia, extension of ventricular depolarization time (tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations (10-14 mg/kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling, fusion, dissolution, and/or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment. Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue; and 3) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined, only COXII gene expression was suppressed by ADR treatment, mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver. Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40% of heart muscle by weight, we conclude that the deteriorating effects of ADR on cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural and functional impairment.
The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone in the treatment of severe heart failure is frequently restricted because they cause vasodilation and hypotension. In patients with decompensated heart failure with hypotension after treatment with milrinone, low doses of vasopressin restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of milrinone.
The use of serum cholinesterase in succinylcholine apnoea.
The vast majority of both polymorphic and sporadic G6PD variants are due to single missense mutations. In the four polymorphic variants that have two point mutations, one of the mutations is always 376 A-- > G (126 Asn-- > Asp), which on its own gives rise to the nondeficient polymorphic variant, G6PD A. In a study of G6PD deficient patients who presented with clinical favism in Spain, we have found a new polymorphic variant that we have called G6PD Malaga, whose only abnormality is a 542 A-- > T (181 Asp-- > Val) mutation. This is the same mutation as previously found in association with the mutation of G6PD A in the double mutant, G6PD Santamaria. G6PD Malaga is associated with enzyme deficiency (class III), and the enzymic properties of G6PD Malaga and G6PD Santamaria are quite similar, indicating that in this case the effects of the two mutations are additive rather than synergistic. G6PD Santamaria might have been produced by recombination between G6PD A and G6PD Malaga; however haplotype analysis, including the use of a new silent polymorphism, suggests that the same 542 A-- > T mutation has taken place independently in a G6PD B gene to give G6PD Malaga and in a G6PD A gene to give G6PD Santamaria. These findings help to outline the relationship and evolution of mutations in the human G6PD locus..
The vertebrate homologues of Drosophila dachsund, DACH1 and DACH2, have been implicated as important regulatory genes in development. DACH1 plays a role in retinal and pituitary precursor cell proliferation and DACH2 plays a specific role in myogenesis. DACH proteins contain a domain (DS domain) that is conserved with the proto-oncogenes Ski and Sno. Since the Ski/Sno proto-oncogenes repress AP-1 and SMAD signaling, we hypothesized that DACH1 might play a similar cellular function. Herein, DACH1 was found to be expressed in breast cancer cell lines and to inhibit transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced apoptosis. DACH1 repressed TGF-beta induction of AP-1 and Smad signaling in gene reporter assays and repressed endogenous TGF-beta-responsive genes by microarray analyses. DACH1 bound to endogenous NCoR and Smad4 in cultured cells and DACH1 co-localized with NCoR in nuclear dotlike structures. NCoR enhanced DACH1 repression, and the repression of TGF-beta-induced AP-1 or Smad signaling by DACH1 required the DACH1 DS domain. The DS domain of DACH was sufficient for NCoR binding at a Smad4-binding site. Smad4 was required for DACH1 repression of Smad signaling. In Smad4 null HTB-134 cells, DACH1 inhibited the activation of SBE-4 reporter activity induced by Smad2 or Smad3 only in the presence of Smad4. DACH1 participates in the negative regulation of TGF-beta signaling by interacting with NCoR and Smad4.
The vitamin A derivative retinoic acid exerts its effects on transcription through two distinct classes of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR). We provide evidence that expression of the gene for cellular retinol-binding protein type II (CRBPII), a key protein in the intestinal absorption of vitamin A, is dramatically up-regulated by retinoic acid in the presence of RXR but not RAR. This regulation is conferred through a specific cis element in the CRBPII promoter that contains five nearly perfect tandem repeats of the sequence AGGTCA spaced by a single nucleotide. The discovery of this new RX response element provides a means for distinguishing between the two retinoid receptor systems and suggests that an RXR-mediated pathway exists for modulating vitamin A metabolism.
The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease product is thought to down-regulate transcription by antagonizing elongin-enhanced transcriptional elongation. Germline VHL gene mutations predispose to the development of retinal, cerebellar and spinal haemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma. In addition, somatic Inactivation of the VHL gene is frequent in sporadic renal cell carcinoma and haemangioblastoma. Regulation of transcript elongation is an important control mechanism for gene expression and the VHL gene might modify the expression of proto-oncogenes and growth suppressor genes during embryogenesis. We therefore investigated the expression of VHL mRNA during human embryogenesis by in situ hybridization studies at 4, 6 and 10 weeks post conception. Although VHL mRNA was expressed in all three germ layers, strong expression was noted in the central nervous system, kidneys, testis and lung. Within the kidney, VHL mRNA was differentially expressed within renal tubules suggesting that the VHL gene product may have a specific role in kidney development. Two alternatively spliced VHL mRNAs characterized by inclusion (isoform I) or exclusion (isoform II) of exon 2 are transcribed in adult tissues. To investigate if the two isoforms are differentially expressed during embryogenesis, VHL mRNA was reverse transcribed from 13 fetal tissues (8-10 weeks gestation). The quantitative distribution of VHL mRNA within fetal tissues reflected that seen by in situ hybridization and the ratio of the two VHL isoforms was similar between tissues. Although the genes regulated by the VHL gene product have not yet been identified, our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that VHL-mediated control of transcriptional elongation may have a role in normal human development..
The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) has a critical role in the pathogenesis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), as VHL mutations have been found in both von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated and sporadic RCCs. Recent studies suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA is upregulated in RCC- and von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors. We have therefore assessed the effect of the VHL gene product on VEGF expression. VEGF promoter-luciferase constructs were transiently cotransfected with a wild-type VHL (wt-VHL) vector in several cell lines, including 293 embryonic kidney and RCC cell lines. wt-VHL protein inhibited VEGF promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner up to 5- to 10-fold. Deletion analysis defined a 144-bp region of the VEGF promoter necessary for VHL repression. This VHL-responsive element is GC rich and specifically binds the transcription factor Sp1 in crude nuclear extracts. In Drosophila cells, cotransfected VHL represses Sp1-mediated activation but not basal activity of the VEGF promoter. We next demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitates that VHL and Sp1 were part of the same complex and, by using a glutathione-S-transferase-VHL fusion protein and purified Sp1, that VHL and Sp1 directly interact. Furthermore, endogenous VEGF mRNA levels were suppressed in permanent RCC cell lines expressing wt-VHL, and nuclear run-on studies indicated that VHL regulation of VEGF occurs at least partly at the transcriptional level. These observations support a new mechanism for VHL-mediated transcriptional repression via a direct inhibitory action on Sp1 and suggest that loss of Sp1 inhibition may be important in the pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease and RCC..
The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene is required for cell cycle exit upon serum withdrawal.
The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product interacts with Sp1 to repress vascular endothelial growth factor promoter activity.
The whole genome approach enables the characterization of all components of any given biological pathway. Moreover, it can help to uncover all the metabolic routes for any molecule. Here we have used the genome of Drosophila melanogaster to search for enzymes involved in the metabolism of fucosylated glycans. Our results suggest that in the fruit fly GDP-fucose, the donor for fucosyltransferase reactions, is formed exclusively via the de novo pathway from GDP-mannose through enzymatic reactions catalyzed by GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose 3,5-epimerase/4-reductase (GMER, also known as FX in man). The Drosophila genome does not have orthologs for the salvage pathway enzymes, i.e. fucokinase and GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylase synthesizing GDP-fucose from fucose. In addition we identified two novel fucosyltransferases predicted to catalyze alpha1,3- and alpha1,6-specific linkages to the GlcNAc residues on glycans. No genes with the capacity to encode alpha1,2-specific fucosyltransferases were found. We also identified two novel genes coding for O-fucosyltransferases and a gene responsible for a fucosidase enzyme in the Drosophila genome. Finally, using the Drosophila CG4435 gene, we identified two novel human genes putatively coding for fucosyltransferases. This work can serve as a basis for further whole-genome approaches in mapping all possible glycosylation pathways and as a basic analysis leading to subsequent experimental studies to verify the predictions made in this work.
The yeast exosome is a complex of 3' --> 5' exoribonucleases. Sequence analysis identified putative human homologues for exosome components, although several were found only as expressed sequence tags. Here we report the cloning of full-length cDNAs, which encode putative human homologues of the Rrp40p, Rrp41p, and Rrp46p components of the exosome. Recombinant proteins were expressed and used to raise rabbit antisera. In Western blotting experiments, these decorated HeLa cell proteins of the predicted sizes. All three human proteins were enriched in the HeLa cells nucleus and nucleolus, but were also clearly detected in the cytoplasm. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p were present in a large complex. This cofractionated with the human homologues of other exosome components, hRrp4p and PM/Scl-100. Anti-PM/Scl-positive patient sera coimmunoprecipitated hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p demonstrating their physical association. The immunoprecipitated complex exhibited 3' --> 5' exoribonuclease activity in vitro. hRrp41p was expressed in yeast and shown to suppress the lethality of genetic depletion of yeast Rrp41p. We conclude that hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p represent novel components of the human exosome complex.
The yeast-based two hybrid has been used to identify a novel protein that binds to the intracellular domain of the type 1 receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNFR-1IC). The TNF receptor-associated protein, TRAP-1, shows strong homology to members of the 90-kDa family of heat shock proteins. After in vitro transcription/translation and 35S labeling, TRAP-1 was precipitated using a fusion protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase and TNFR-1IC, showing that the two proteins directly interact. The ability of deletion mutants of TNFR-1 to interact with TRAP-1 was tested using the two hybrid system. This showed that the amino acid sequences that mediate binding are diffusely distributed outside of the domain in the C terminus of TNFR-1IC that signals cytotoxicity. The 2.4-kilobase TRAP-1 mRNA was variably expressed in skeletal muscle, liver, heart, brain, kidney, pancreas, lung, and placenta. TRAP-1 mRNA was also detected in each of eight different transformed cell lines. Identification of TRAP-1 may be an important step toward defining how TNFR-1, which does not contain protein tyrosine kinase activity, transmits its message to signal transduction pathways.
The yield of severe cirrhosis of the liver (defined as a shrunken finely nodular liver with micronodular histology, ascites greater than 30 ml, plasma albumin less than 2.2 g/dl, splenomegaly 2-3 times normal, and testicular atrophy approximately half normal weight) after 12 doses of carbon tetrachloride given intragastrically in the phenobarbitone-primed rat was increased from 25% to 56% by giving the initial "calibrating" dose of carbon tetrachloride at the peak of the phenobarbitone-induced enlargement of the liver. At this point it was assumed that the cytochrome P450/CCl4 toxic state was both maximal and stable. The optimal rat size to begin phenobarbitone was determined as 100 g, and this size as a group had a mean maximum relative liver weight increase 47% greater than normal rats of the same body weight. The optimal time for the initial dose of carbon tetrachloride was after 14 days on phenobarbitone.
The zinc finger protein ZPR1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after treatment of cells with mitogens. The function of nuclear ZPR1 has not been defined. Here we demonstrate that ZPR1 accumulates in the nucleolus of proliferating cells. The role of ZPR1 was examined using a gene disruption strategy. Cells lacking ZPR1 are not viable. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the loss of ZPR1 caused disruption of nucleolar function, including preribosomal RNA expression. These data establish ZPR1 as an essential protein that is required for normal nucleolar function in proliferating cells.
Theophylline neurotoxicity in pregnant rats.
Therapeutic drug monitoring of tobramycin: once-daily versus twice-daily dosage schedules.
There are very few reports about asterixis as a side effect of treatment with psychopharmacologic agents. In this report we present four patients treated with a combination of different psychotropic drugs, in whom asterixis was triggered either by adding carbamazepine (CBZ) to a treatment regimen, or by increasing its dosage. Neither dosage nor serum levels of CBZ were in a higher range. We consider asterixis to be an easily overlooked sign of neurotoxicity, which may occur even at low or moderate dosage levels, if certain drugs as lithium or clozapine are used in combination with CBZ.
There have been concerns that the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events may be higher with cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors than nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We evaluated cardiovascular event data for valdecoxib, a new COX-2-specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials. The incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events (cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular, or arterial thrombotic) was determined by analyzing pooled valdecoxib (10-80 mg daily), nonselective NSAID (diclofenac 75 mg bid, ibuprofen 800 mg tid, or naproxen 500 mg bid) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis trials that were 6-52 weeks in duration. The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients (n = 7934) and in users of low-dose (< or =325 mg daily) aspirin (n = 1051) and nonusers of aspirin (n = 6883). Crude and exposure-adjusted incidences of thrombotic events were similar for valdecoxib, NSAIDs, and placebo. The risk of serious thrombotic events was also similar for each valdecoxib dose. Thrombotic risk was consistently higher for users of aspirin users than nonusers of aspirin (placebo, 1.4% vs. 0%; valdecoxib, 1.7% vs. 0.2%; NSAIDs, 1.9% vs. 0.5%). The rates of events in users of aspirin were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across valdecoxib doses. Short- and intermediate-term treatment with therapeutic (10 or 20 mg daily) and supratherapeutic (40 or 80 mg daily) valdecoxib doses was not associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events relative to nonselective NSAIDs or placebo in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients in controlled clinical trials.
There is a growing list of drugs implicated in acquired long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes. However, the torsadogenic potential of metoclopramide, a commonly used antiemetic and prokinetic drug, has not been reported in the literature, despite its chemical similarity to procainamide. We report on a 92-year-old woman with preexisting complete left bundle branch block who developed torsade de pointes after intravenous and oral administration of metoclopramide. This patient also developed torsade de pointes when cisapride and erythromycin were given simultaneously. These two episodes were suppressed successfully after discontinuing the offending drugs and administering class IB drugs. This is the first documentation that metoclopramide provokes torsade de pointes clinically. Metoclopramide should be used cautiously in patients with a risk of torsade de pointes.
There is evidence that growth hormone may be related to the progression of weakness in Duchenne dystrophy. We conducted a 12-month controlled trial of mazindol, a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor, in 83 boys with Duchenne dystrophy. Muscle strength, contractures, functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after treatment with mazindol (3 mg/d) or placebo. The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0.90 to detect a slowing to 25% of the expected rate of progression of weakness at P less than 0.05. Mazindol did not benefit strength at any point in the study. Side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased appetite (36%), dry mouth (10%), behavioral change (22%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (18%); mazindol dosage was reduced in 43% of patients. The effect of mazindol on GH secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive IGF-I levels obtained following 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in the mazindol treated to those in the placebo groups. Although mazindol-treated patients gained less weight and height than placebo-treated patients, no significant effect on IGF-I levels was observed. Mazindol doses not slow the progression of weakness in Duchenne dystrophy.
There is now evidence to suggest a central role for the dopaminergic system in restless legs syndrome (RLS). For example, the symptoms of RLS can be dramatically improved by levodopa and dopamine agonists, whereas central dopamine D2 receptor antagonists can induce or aggravate RLS symptoms. To our knowledge, there is no previous report regarding whether domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, can also induce or aggravate symptoms of RLS. Mirtazapine, the first noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), has been associated with RLS in several recent publications. The authors report here a depressed patient comorbid with postprandial dyspepsia who developed RLS after mirtazapine had been added to his domperidone therapy. Our patient started to have symptoms of RLS only after he had been treated with mirtazapine, and his RLS symptoms resolved completely upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine. Such a temporal relationship between the use of mirtazapine and the symptoms of RLS in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine-associated RLS. However, physicians should be aware of the possibility that mirtazapine can be associated with RLS in some individuals, especially those receiving concomitant dopamine D2 receptor antagonists.
Thermal enhancement of Adriamycin-mediated antitumor activity and normal tissue toxicities by whole body hyperthermia were compared using a F344 rat model. Antitumor activity was studied using a tumor growth delay assay. Acute normal tissue toxicities (i.e., leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) and late normal tissue toxicities (i.e., myocardial and kidney injury) were evaluated by functional/physiological assays and by morphological techniques. Whole body hyperthermia (120 min at 41.5 degrees C) enhanced both Adriamycin-mediated antitumor activity and toxic side effects. The thermal enhancement ratio calculated for antitumor activity was 1.6. Thermal enhancement ratios estimated for "acute" hematological changes were 1.3, whereas those estimated for "late" damage (based on morphological cardiac and renal lesions) varied between 2.4 and 4.3. Thus, while whole body hyperthermia enhances Adriamycin-mediated antitumor effect, normal tissue toxicity is also increased, and the potential therapeutic gain of the combined modality treatment is eroded.
These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug-induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents. Apomorphine, a nonselective dopamine agonist, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce hypothermia, and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain. From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine-induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed. In rats, detection of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions. Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug-induced hypothermia. In mice, apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage. Drug-induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only, while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both. By contrast, apomorphine-induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box. Dopamine turnover ratios (DOPAC:DA and HVA:DA) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts. However, apomorphine-induced reductions in striatal dopamine turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environments. The implications of these findings are discussed with particular emphasis upon conducting psychopharmacological challenge tests in rodents.
Thiazide diuretics are widely accepted as the cornerstone of antihypertensive treatment programs. Hypokalemia is a commonly encountered metabolic consequence of chronic thiazide therapy. We treated 38 patients (22 low renin, 16 normal renin) with moderate diastolic hypertension with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTC) administered on a twice daily schedule. Initial dose was 50 mg and the dose was increased at monthly intervals to 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg daily until blood pressure normalized. The serum K during the control period was 4.5 +/- 0.2 mEq/l an on 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg HCTZ daily 3.9 +/- 0.3, 3.4 +/- 0.2, 2.9 +/- 0.2, and 2.4 +/- 0.3 mEq/l, respectively. Corresponding figures for whole body K were 4107 +/- 208, 3722 +/- 319, 3628 +/- 257, 3551 +/- 336, and 3269 +/- 380 mEq, respectively. In 13 patients we observed the effects of HCTZ therapy (100 mg daily) on the occurrence of PVC's during rest as well as during static and dynamic exercise. During rest we observed 0.6 +/- 0.08 PVC beats/min +/- SEM and during static and dynamic exercise 0.6 +/- 0.06 and 0.8 +/- 0.15, respectively. Corresponding figures during HCTZ therapy 100 mg daily were 1.4 +/- 0.1, 3.6 +/- 0.7 and 5.7 4/- 0.8, respectively. The occurrence of PVC's correlated significantly with the fall in serum K+ observed r = 0.72, p less than 0.001. In conclusion we found that thiazide diuretics cause hypokalemia and depletion of body potassium. The more profound hypokalemia, the greater the propensity for the occurrence of PVC's.

Thiopentone pretreatment for propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients.
Thirteen psoriatic patients with hypertension during the course of cyclosporin A therapy were treated for 25 months with a calcium channel blocker, sustained-release nifedipine, to study the clinical antihypertensive effects and adverse events during treatment with both drugs. Seven of the 13 patients had exhibited a subclinical hypertensive state before cyclosporin A therapy. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures of these 13 patients were decreased significantly after 4 weeks of nifedipine therapy, and blood pressure was maintained within the normal range thereafter for 25 months. The adverse events during combined therapy with cyclosporin A and nifedipine included an increase in blood urea nitrogen levels in 9 of the 13 patients and development of gingival hyperplasia in 2 of the 13 patients. Our findings indicate that sustained-release nifedipine is useful for hypertensive psoriatic patients under long-term treatment with cyclosporin A, but that these patients should be monitored for gingival hyperplasia.
Thirty-four patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who were treated with flurbiprofen at a maximum dose of 4 mg/kg/day, had statistically significant decreases from baseline in 6 arthritis indices after 12 weeks of treatment. Improvements were seen in the number of tender joints, the severity of swelling and tenderness, the time of walk 50 feet, the duration of morning stiffness and the circumference of the left knee. The most frequently observed side effect was fecal occult blood (25% of patients); however, there was no other evidence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in these patients. One patient was prematurely discontinued from the study for severe headache and abdominal pain. Most side effects were mild and related to the GI tract.
Thirty-seven families with four or more cases of breast cancer or breast and ovarian cancer were analyzed for mutations in BRCA1. Twelve different germ-line mutations, four novel and eight previously observed, were detected in 16 families. Five families of Ashkenazi Jewish descent carried the 185delAG mutation and shared the same haplotype at eight polymorphic markers spanning approximately 850 kb at BRCA1. Expressivity of 185delAG in these families varied, from early-onset breast cancer without ovarian cancer. Mutation 4184delTCAA occurred independently in two families. In one family, penetrance was complete, with females developing early-onset breast cancer or ovarian cancer and the male carrier developing prostatic cancer, whereas, in the other family, penetrance was incomplete and only breast cancer occurred, diagnosed at ages 38-81 years. Two novel nonsense mutations led to the loss of mutant BRCA1 transcript in families with 10 and 6 cases of early-onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer. A 665-nt segment of the BRCA1 3-UTR and 1. 3 kb of genomic sequence including the putative promoter region were invariant by single-strand conformation analysis in 13 families without coding-sequence mutations. Overall in our series, BRCA1 mutations have been detected in 26 families 16 with positive BRCA1 lod scores, 7 with negative lod scores (reflecting multiple sporadic breast cancers), and 3 not tested for linkage. Three other families have positive lod scores for linkage to BRCA2, but 13 families without detected BRCA1 mutations have negative lod scores for both BRCA1 and BRCA2.
Thirty-two unrelated patients with features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, a common autosomal dominant condition of craniosynostosis and limb anomalies, were screened for mutations in TWIST, FGFR2, and FGFR3. Nine novel and three recurrent TWIST mutations were found in 12 families. Seven families were found to have the FGFR3 P250R mutation, and one individual was found to have an FGFR2 VV269-270 deletion. To date, our detection rate for TWIST or FGFR mutations is 68% in our Saethre-Chotzen syndrome patients, including our five patients elsewhere reported with TWIST mutations. More than 35 different TWIST mutations are now known in the literature. The most common phenotypic features, present in more than a third of our patients with TWIST mutations, are coronal synostosis, brachycephaly, low frontal hairline, facial asymmetry, ptosis, hypertelorism, broad great toes, and clinodactyly. Significant intra- and interfamilial phenotypic variability is present for either TWIST mutations or FGFR mutations. The overlap in clinical features and the presence, in the same genes, of mutations for more than one craniosynostotic condition-such as Saethre-Chotzen, Crouzon, and Pfeiffer syndromes-support the hypothesis that TWIST and FGFRs are components of the same molecular pathway involved in the modulation of craniofacial and limb development in humans..
This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active acromegaly treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog octreotide in dosages of 300-1500 micrograms/day for a mean of 24.2 +/- 13.9 months. During treatment with octreotide, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had gallstones, and 1 developed acute cholecystitis requiring surgery. In all of 7 patients examined acutely, gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100-micrograms injection. In 8 patients followed for 24 weeks, gallbladder contractility remained depressed throughout therapy. After withdrawal of octreotide in 10 patients without gallstones, 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month. In 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed gallstones during treatment, gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients (3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks), and remained depressed in 3 (2 of whom had stones present at 6 months). Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge, gallstones, and cholecystitis during octreotide therapy in Chinese acromegalic patients. It is therefore very important to follow the changes of gallbladder function during long-term octreotide therapy of acromegalic patients.
This case illustrates that patients receiving ritodrine for preterm labor may risk interactions between the residual betamimetic effects of ritodrine and the effects of anesthetics during cesarean section. Such interactions may result in serious cardiovascular complications even after cessation of an infusion of ritodrine. Preoperative assessment should focus on cardiovascular status and serum potassium level. Delaying induction of anesthesia should be considered whenever possible. Careful fluid administration and cautious use of titrated doses of ephedrine are advised. After delivery of the infant, there should be no contraindication to the use of an alpha-adrenergic vasopressor such as phenylephrine to treat hypotensive patients with tachycardia.
This case report describes a generalized seizure associated with sustained-release bupropion use and sleep deprivation. The subject, a 31-year-old female smoker, was participating in a clinical trial evaluating an investigational medication for smoking cessation that used sustained-release bupropion as an active control. After 5 weeks of bupropion use, the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic seizure after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence. The patient had no other risk factors for seizures. We suggest that sleep deprivation may add to the risk of bupropion-associated seizures.
This case study highlights the important contribution of nursing in obtaining an accurate health history. The case discussed herein initially appeared to be neurogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) secondary to a traumatic brain injury. The nursing staff, by reviewing the patient's health history with his family, discovered a history of polydipsia and long-standing lithium use. Lithium is implicated in drug-induced nephrogenic DI, and because the patient had not received lithium since being admitted to the hospital, his treatment changed to focus on nephrogenic DI. By combining information from the patient history, the physical examination, and radiologic and laboratory studies, the critical care team demonstrated that the patient had been self-treating his lithium-induced nephrogenic DI and developed neurogenic DI secondary to brain trauma. Thus successful treatment required that nephrogenic and neurogenic DI be treated concomitantly.
This case study reveals an unusual finding of rapidly proliferative crescentic glomerulonephritis in a patient treated with rifampin who had no other identifiable causes for developing this disease. This patient underwent a 10-month regimen of rifampin and isoniazid for pulmonary tuberculosis and was discovered to have developed signs of severe renal failure five weeks after completion of therapy. Renal biopsy revealed severe glomerulonephritis with crescents, electron dense fibrillar deposits and moderate lymphocytic interstitial infiltrate. Other possible causes of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis were investigated and ruled out. This report documents the unusual occurrence of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with crescents and fibrillar glomerulonephritis in a patient treated with rifampin.
This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of haloperidol alone and haloperidol plus sertraline on cognitive and psychomotor function in 24 healthy male subjects. METHOD: All subjects received placebo on Day 1 and haloperidol 2 mg on Days 2 and 25. From Days 9 to 25, subjects were randomly assigned to either sertraline (12 subjects) or placebo (12 subjects); the sertraline dose was titrated from 50 to 200 mg/day from Days 9 to 16, and remained at 200 mg/day for the final 10 days of the drug administration period. Cognitive function testing was performed before dosing and over a 24-hour period after dosing on Days 1, 2, and 25. RESULTS: Impairment of cognitive function was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of haloperidol on Day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing. When single-dose haloperidol was given again 25 days later, greater impairment with earlier onset was noted in several tests in both treatment groups, suggesting enhancement of this effect. There was no indication that sertraline exacerbated the impairment produced by haloperidol since an equivalent effect also occurred in the placebo group. Three subjects (2 on sertraline and 1 on placebo) withdrew from the study because of side effects. Ten subjects in each group reported side effects related to treatment. The side effect profiles of sertraline and of placebo were similar. CONCLUSION: Haloperidol produced a clear profile of cognitive impairment that was not worsened by concomitant sertraline administration.
This is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism in a patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term amiodarone therapy. Myxedema coma is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20% with treatment. The condition is treated with intravenous thyroxine (T4) or intravenous tri-iodo-thyronine (T3). Patients with CHF on amiodarone may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from hypothyroidism, and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of amiodarone among CHF patients. The myriad clinical presentation of myxedema coma and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among CHF patients presenting with hypotension, weakness or other unexplained symptoms.
This is a case report on a 45-year old African-American female with newly diagnosed hypertension, who was started on a combination pill of amlodipine/benazapril 10/5 mg. The very next day, she presented at the emergency room (ER) with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Physical exam, complete metabolic panel, and hemogram were in the normal range. She was discharged from the ER after a few hours of treatment with fluid and analgesics. However, she returned to the ER the next day with the same complaints. This time the physical exam was significant for a distended abdomen with dullness to percussion. CT scan of the abdomen revealed markedly thickened antrum of the stomach, duodenum and jejunum, along with fluid in the abdominal and pelvic cavity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-induced angioedema was suspected, and anti-hypertensive medications were discontinued. Her symptoms improved within the next 24 hours, and repeat CT after 72 hours revealed marked improvement in stomach and small bowel thickening and resolution of ascites. The recognition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) intestinal angioedema constitutes a challenge to primary care physicians, internists, emergency room personal and surgeons.
This is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long-term lithium treatment on the kidney. Creatinine clearance, maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long-term lithium for more than one year. These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to lithium, available for most of our patients. No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during lithium treatment. Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre-lithium values. Urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patients. The concentration defect appeared reversible, at least in part. Polyuria above 3 litres/24 hours was found in 10% of patients. An attempt is made to draw practical conclusions from the preliminary findings.
This paper attempts to examine and compare prevalence rates and symptom patterns of DSM substance-induced and other mood disorders. 243 cocaine-dependent outpatients with cocaine-induced mood disorder (CIMD), other mood disorders, or no mood disorder were compared on measures of psychiatric symptoms. The prevalence rate for CIMD was 12% at baseline. Introduction of the DSM-IV diagnosis of CIMD did not substantially affect rates of the other depressive disorders. Patients with CIMD had symptom severity levels between those of patients with and without a mood disorder. These findings suggest some validity for the new DSM-IV diagnosis of CIMD, but also suggest that it requires further specification and replication.
This paper describes the clinical features of six children who developed the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome after treatment with metronidazole. These children were older and were more likely to have undergone recent bowel surgery than are other children with this condition. While the involvement of metronidazole in the aetiology of the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome is not established firmly, the action of this drug in sensitizing tissues to oxidation injury and the reported evidence of oxidation changes in the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome suggest a possible link between metronidazole treatment and some cases of the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome.
This paper presents the clinical and metabolic findings in two young boys with long-standing Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Following short exposure to oral prednisone, both boys developed lethargy, increasing somnolence, polydipsia, polyphagia, and polyuria. Both presented in the emergency room with profound coma, hypotension, severe hyperglycemia, and acidosis. Nonketotic lactic acidosis was present in one and ketosis without a known serum lactate level was present in the other. Respiratory failure rapidly ensued and both patients expired in spite of efforts at resuscitation. We believe these two cases represent a newly described and catastrophic metabolic-endocrine failure in the Kearns-Sayre syndrome.
This paper reports the results of a study of 50 menopausal women receiving hormonal replacement therapy. The majority (29) had surgical menopause; their mean age was 45.7 years. It was hypothesized that progestins could equilibrate the effects of the estrogenic stimulation on the mammary and endometrial target tissues of women on hormonal replacement therapy. The treatment schedule consisted of conjugated estrogens (Premarin) 1.25 mg/day for 21 days and Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day for 10 days in each month. The mean treatment period was 18 months. During the follow-up period, attention was paid to breast modifications as evidenced by symptomatology, physical examination, and plate thermography. Mastodynia was reported by 21 patients, and physical examination revealed a light increase in breast firmness in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nodularity in 2 women. Themography confirmed the existence of an excessive breast stimulation in 1 women who complained of moderate mastodynia and in 5 of the 7 women who complained of severe mastodynia. Normalization was obtained by halving the estrogen dose. These results suggest that hormonal replacement therapy can be safely prescribed if the following criteria are satisfied: 1) preliminary evaluation of patients from a clinical, metabolic, cytologic, and mammographic perspective; 2) cyclic treatment schedule, with a progestative phase of 10 days; and 3) periodic complete follow-up, with accurate thermographic evaluation of the breast target tissues.
This pilot study examines whether hormone therapy for breast cancer affects cognition. Patients participating in a randomised trial of anastrozole, tamoxifen alone or combined (ATAC) (n=94) and a group of women without breast cancer (n=35) completed a battery of neuropsychological measures. Compared with the control group, the patients were impaired on a processing speed task (p=0.032) and on a measure of immediate verbal memory (p=0.026) after controlling for the use of hormone replacement therapy in both groups. Patient group performance was not significantly related to length of treatment or measures of psychological morbidity. The results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of breast cancer. Verbal memory may be especially sensitive to changes in oestrogen levels, a finding commonly reported in studies of hormone replacement therapy in healthy women. In view of the increased use of hormone therapies in an adjuvant and preventative setting their impact on cognitive functioning should be investigated more thoroughly.
This report describes a case of encephalopathy developed in the course of amitriptyline therapy, during a remission of unipolar depression. This patient could have been diagnosed as having either neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or serotonin syndrome (SS). The major determinant of the symptoms may have been dopamine/serotonin imbalance in the central nervous system. The NMS-like encephalopathy that develops in association with the use of antidepressants indicates that NMS and SS are spectrum disorders induced by drugs with both antidopaminergic and serotonergic effects.
This report describes unique contrast enhancement of the white matter on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of two patients with disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy, which developed from acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with high-dose methotrexate. In both patients, the enhancement was more pronounced near the base of the brain than at the vertex. Necropsy of the first case revealed loss of myelination and necrosis of the white matter. Possible mechanisms causing such a leukoencephalopathy are discussed.
This report presents the clinical, laboratory, and light and electron microscopic observations on a patient with chronic active (aggressive) hepatitis caused by the administration of propylthiouracil. This is an addition to the list of drugs that must be considered in the evaluation of chronic liver disease.
This retrospective study describes toxicity associated with a protocol of lomustine (CCNU) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) in dogs with lymphoma. CCNU was administered per os (PO) at a targeted dosage of 60 mg/m(2) body surface area on day 0, CTX was administered PO at a targeted dosage of 250 mg/m(2) divided over days 0 through 4, and all dogs received prophylactic antibiotics. Ninety treatments were given to the 57 dogs included in the study. Neutropenia was the principal toxic effect, and the overall frequency of grade 4 neutropenia after the first treatment of CCNU/CTX was 30% (95% confidence interval, 19-43%). The mean body weight of dogs with grade 4 neutropenia (19.7 kg + 13.4 kg) was significantly less than the mean body weight of dogs that did not develop grade 4 neutropenia (31.7 kg + 12.4 kg; P = .005). One dog (3%) developed hematologic changes suggestive of hepatotoxicity. No dogs had evidence of either renal toxicity or hemorrhagic cystitis. Adverse gastrointestinal effects were uncommon. On the basis of the findings reported herein, a dose of 60 mg/m(2) of CCNU combined with 250 mg/m(2) of CTX (divided over 5 days) q 4 wk is tolerable in tumor-bearing dogs.
This study analyzed the behavior of an antiadhesive membrane molecule, CD43, in neutrophil polarization and locomotion. CD43 cross-linking by antibodies induced neutrophil locomotion, with CD43 molecules clustered at the uropod of polarized neutrophils. In contrast, CD11b/CD18 cross-linking by antibodies did not affect either cell polarization or locomotion. Stimulation of suspended or adherent neutrophils with chemotactic peptide results in cell polarization and locomotion and a concomitant redistribution of CD43 to the uropod. This process is entirely reversible. The study also investigated which actin-binding protein could be involved in CD43 lateral redistribution. alpha-Actinin and moesin are preferentially adsorbed on Sepharose beads bearing a recombinant CD43 intracellular domain. Analysis by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy shows a codistribution of moesin during CD43 lateral redistribution. By contrast, alpha-actinin is located at the leading edge, an area devoid of CD43. These results shed new light on the role of CD43 membrane redistribution, which appears to be directly related to neutrophil polarity and locomotion. (Blood. 2000;95:2462-2470)
This study describes neuropsychiatric side effects in patients after treatment with mefloquine. Reactions consisted mainly of seizures, acute psychoses, anxiety neurosis, and major disturbances of sleep-wake rhythm. Side effects occurred after both therapeutic and prophylactic intake and were graded from moderate to severe. In a risk analysis of neuropsychiatric side effects in Germany, it is estimated that one of 8,000 mefloquine users suffers from such reactions. The incidence calculation revealed that one of 215 therapeutic users had reactions, compared with one of 13,000 in the prophylaxis group, making the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions after mefloquine treatment 60 times higher than after prophylaxis. Therefore, certain limitations for malaria prophylaxis and treatment with mefloquine are recommended.
This study examined the frequency of atrioventricular (AV) dissociation and accelerated junctional rhythms in 59 patients receiving oral verapamil. Accelerated junctional rhythms and AV dissociation were frequent in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, particularly AV nodal reentry. Verapamil administration to these patients led to an asymptomatic increase in activity of these junctional pacemakers. In patients with various chest pain syndromes, verapamil neither increased the frequency of junctional rhythms nor suppressed their role as escape rhythms under physiologically appropriate circumstances.
This study investigated alleviation of streptomycin-induced vestibulotoxicity by edaravone in guinea pigs. Edaravone, a free radical scavenger, has potent free radical quenching action and is used in clinical practice to treat cerebral infarction. Streptomycin was administered to the inner ear by osmotic pump for 24 h, and edaravone (n=8) or saline (n=6) was intraperitoneally injected once a day for 7 days. We observed horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex as a marker of postoperative vestibular function. Animals injected with saline showed statistically smaller gains than those injected with edaravone. These results suggest that edaravone suppresses streptomycin-induced vestibulotoxicity.
This study investigated propofol injection pain in patients undergoing ambulatory anaesthesia. In a randomized, double-blind trial, 90 women were allocated to receive one of three treatments prior to induction of anaesthesia with propofol. Patients in Group C received 2 ml normal saline, Group L, 2 ml, lidocaine 2% (40 mg) and Group T, 2 ml thiopentone 2.5% (50 mg). Venous discomfort was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS) 5-15 sec after commencing propofol administration using an infusion pump (rate 1000 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). Loss of consciousness occurred in 60-90 sec. Visual analogue scores (mean +/- SD) during induction were lower in Groups L (3.3 +/- 2.5) and T (4.1 +/- 2.7) than in Group C (5.6 +/- 2.3); P = 0.0031. The incidence of venous discomfort was lower in Group L (76.6%; P < 0.05) than in Group C (100%) but not different from Group T (90%). The VAS scores for recall of pain in the recovery room were correlated with the VAS scores during induction (r = 0.7045; P < 0.0001). Recovery room discharge times were similar: C (75.9 +/- 19.4 min); L 73.6 +/- 21.6 min); T (77.1 +/- 18.9 min). Assessing their overall satisfaction, 89.7% would choose propofol anaesthesia again. We conclude that lidocaine reduces the incidence and severity of propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients whereas thiopentone only reduces its severity.
This study investigated the visual defects associated with the antiepileptic drug vigabatrin (VGB). Two hundred four people with epilepsy were grouped on the basis of antiepileptic drug therapy (current, previous, or no exposure to VGB). Groups were matched with respect to age, gender, and seizure frequency. All patients underwent objective assessment of electrophysiological function (wide-field multifocal electroretinography) and conventional visual field testing (static perimetry). Bilateral visual field constriction was observed in 59% of patients currently taking VGB, 43% of patients who previously took VGB, and 24% of patients with no exposure to VGB. Assessment of retinal function revealed abnormal responses in 48% of current VGB users and 22% of prior VGB users, but in none of the patients without previous exposure to VGB. Bilateral visual field abnormalities are common in the treated epilepsy population, irrespective of drug history. Assessment by conventional static perimetry may neither be sufficiently sensitive nor specific to reliably identify retinal toxicity associated with VGB.
This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10-mg dose of immediate-release oxycodone in healthy, older (> 65 years), and middle-aged (35 to 55 years) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily pain. Seventy-one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition (placebo, 10-mg oxycodone). Plasma oxycodone concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose (P < .01) and pupil size, an indication of physiological effects of the medication, peaked at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose (P < .01). Significant declines in simple and sustained attention, working memory, and verbal memory were observed at 1 hour postdose compared to baseline for both age groups with a trend toward return to baseline by 5 hours postdose. For almost all cognitive measures, there were no medication by age-interaction effects, which indicates that the 2 age groups exhibited similar responses to the medication challenge. This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from chronic pain, neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10-mg dose of immediate-release oxycodone are similar to those observed for middle-aged adults. PERSPECTIVE: Study findings indicate that the metabolism, neurocognitive effects, and physical side effects of oral oxycodone are similar for healthy middle-aged and older adults. Therefore, clinicians should not avoid prescribing oral opioids to older adults based on the belief that older adults are at higher risk for side effects than younger adults.
This study prospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy, the incidence of torsades de pointes, and the presumable risk factors for torsades de pointes in patients treated with d,l-sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Eighty-one consecutive patients (54 with coronary artery disease, and 20 with dilated cardiomyopathy) with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation received oral d,l-sotalol to prevent induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia. During oral loading with d,l-sotalol, continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was performed. Those patients in whom d,l-sotalol prevented induction of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were discharged with the drug and followed up on an outpatient basis for 21 +/- 18 months. Induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia was prevented by oral d,l-sotalol in 35 (43%) patients; the ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible in 40 (49%) patients; and two (2.5%) patients did not tolerate even 40 mg of d,l-sotalol once daily. Four (5%) patients had from torsades de pointes during the initial oral treatment with d,l-sotalol. Neither ECG [sinus-cycle length (SCL), QT or QTc interval, or U wave] nor clinical parameters identified patients at risk for torsades de pointes. However, the oral dose of d,l-sotalol was significantly lower in patients with torsades de pointes (200 +/- 46 vs. 328 +/- 53 mg/day; p = 0.0017). Risk factors associated with the development of torsades de pointes were the appearance of an U wave (p = 0.049), female gender (p = 0.015), and significant dose-corrected changes of SCL, QT interval, and QTc interval (p < 0.05). During follow-up, seven (20%) patients had a nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence, and two (6%) patients died suddenly. One female patient with stable cardiac disease had recurrent torsades de pointes after 2 years of successful treatment with d,l-sotalol. Torsades de pointes occurred early during treatment even with low doses of oral d,l-sotalol. Pronounced changes in the surface ECG (cycle length, QT, and QTc) in relation to the dose of oral d,l-sotalol might identify a subgroup of patients with an increased risk for torsades de pointes. Other ECG parameters before the application of d,l-sotalol did not identify patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes. Recurrence rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias are high despite complete suppression of the arrhythmia during programmed stimulation. Therefore programmed electrical stimulation in the case of d,l-sotalol seems to be of limited prognostic value.
This study reports on six cases of deficiency in the human complement regulatory protein Factor H (FH) in the context of an acute renal disease. Five of the cases were observed in children presenting with idiopathic hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Two of the children exhibited a homozygous deficiency characterized by the absence of the 150-kD form of Factor H and the presence, upon immunoblotting, of the 42-kD Factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) and other FH-related protein (FHR) bands. Southern blot and PCR analysis of DNA of one patient with homozygous deficiency ruled out the presence of a large deletion of the FH gene as the underlying defect for the deficiency. The other four children presented with heterozygous deficiency and exhibited a normal immunoblotting pattern of proteins of the FH family. Factor H deficiency is the only complement deficiency associated with HUS. These observations suggest a role for FH and/or FH receptors in the pathogenesis of idiopathic HUS..
This study was designed to disclose detailed genetic mechanisms in salivary gland tumors (SGTs) for development of novel independent marker. We constructed an in-house cDNA microarray carrying 2,201 cDNA clones derived from SGT and oral squamous cell carcinoma cDNA libraries. Four cell lines that originated from the SGT-derived cell lines were analyzed using this microarray system. The genes identified by our microarray system were further analyzed at the mRNA or protein expression level in other types of human cancer cell lines and clinical samples (ten normal salivary glands [NSGs], eleven pleomorphic adenomas, ten adenoid cystic carcinomas and three adenocarcinomas). Two up-regulated genes and six down-regulated genes were identified in common when compared with the control RNA. Of the up-regulated genes, WISP-2, which plays an important role in breast carcinogenesis, was selected for further analyses. We found a higher expression of the WISP-2 gene in the SGT-derived cell lines compared with other types of human cancer cell lines. Furthermore, WISP-2 mRNA and protein expression levels in NSGs were significantly higher than those in SGTs. These results suggest that WISP-2 could be a reliable independent marker and that down-regulation or loss of the WISP-2 gene may be associated with the development of SGTs.
This study was designed to evaluate the effects of pilocarpine and explore the underlying ionic mechanism, using both aconitine-induced rat and ouabain-induced guinea pig arrhythmia models. Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular free-calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in isolated myocytes. The current data showed that pilocarpine significantly delayed onset of arrhythmias, decreased the time course of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, reduced arrhythmia score, and increased the survival time of arrhythmic rats and guinea pigs. [Ca(2+)](i) overload induced by aconitine or ouabain was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with pilocarpine. Moreover, M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide) partially abolished the beneficial effects of pilocarpine. These data suggest that pilocarpine produced antiarrhythmic actions on arrhythmic rat and guinea pig models induced by aconitine or ouabain via stimulating the cardiac M(3)-mAChR. The mechanism may be related to the improvement of Ca(2+) handling.
This study was designed to investigate the chronic cardiotoxic potential of SM-5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM-5887 on low-grade cardiotoxicity pre-induced by doxorubicin in beagle dogs. In the chronic treatment, beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks, either a sublethal dose of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg). The experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing. Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high-grade histopathological cardiomyopathy, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the SM-5887 administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations. To examine a possibly deteriorating cardiotoxic effect of SM-5887, low-grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg). Nine weeks after pre-treatment, dogs were given four courses of either doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks. The low-grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment. On the contrary, the SM-5887 treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy. In conclusion, SM-5887 does not have any potential of chronic cardiotoxicity and deteriorating effect on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in dogs.
This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside were due to nephrotic syndrome per se, or, at least in part, to the aminonucleoside. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of puromycin aminonucleoside (20 mg/kg for 7 days) and the subsequent development of nephrotic syndrome. Since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment, the time-course study was divided into two stages: pre-nephrotic stage (day 1-5) and nephrotic stage (day 6-11). In pre-nephrotic stage the plasma level of fatty acids, triacylglycerol and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid, cholesteryl esters and HDL remained constant. Plasma apolipoprotein A-I tended to increase (40% increase at day 5). At the beginning of nephrotic stage (day 6) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level, while that of apolipoprotein A-I increased abruptly (4-fold increase) and continued to rise, although less steeply, in the following days. The plasma concentration of HDL followed the same pattern. Plasma VLDL and LDL increased at a later stage (day 9). Plasma apolipoprotein A-I was found not only in HDL (1.063-1.210 g/ml) but also in the LDL density class (1.025-1.050 g/ml). In the pre-nephrotic stage lipoproteinuria was negligible, while in the early nephrotic stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL. These observations indicate that puromycin aminonucleoside alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL. It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in nephrotic rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL metabolism.
This study was undertaken to determine the effect of lidocaine pretreatment on reduction of succinylcholine-induced myalgia in patients undergoing general anesthesia for gynecological surgery. One hundred and thirty-five patients were assigned to one of three groups in a prospective, double blind, randomized manner. Group PS, the control group, received normal saline and succinylcholine 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group LS, lidocaine 1.5 mg x kg(-1) and succinylcholine 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group PR, normal saline and rocuronium 0.6 mg x kg(-1). Morphine 0.1 mg x kg(-1) iv was given for premedication and all patients were monitored with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor, ECG and pulse oximetry. Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg.kg(-1) thiopental iv. followed by succinylcholine (Group PS, LS) or rocuronium (Group PR) for tracheal intubation. Following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of fasciculation were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered. The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions. Twenty-four hours later, any myalgia experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management. The results indicate that muscle fasciculation was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of muscle fasciculation than those in Group PS (p < 0.001). At 24 h, the incidence of myalgia was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR (p < 0.05). A correlation was not found between the incidence of myalgia and the occurrence of muscle fasciculation. The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups. In conclusion, where succinylcholine is used, lidocaine is proven to be the useful pretreatment agent for the reduction of postoperative myalgia.
This was an exploratory study to investigate lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains in selected lamivudine-na ve HBV carriers with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection in South African patients. Thirty-five lamivudine-na ve HBV infected patients with or without HIV co-infection were studied: 15 chronic HBV mono-infected patients and 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients. The latter group was further sub-divided into 13 occult HBV (HBsAg-negative) and 7 overt HBV (HBsAg- positive) patients. HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HIV 1/2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using Axsym assays (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). Serum samples were PCR amplified with HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) primers, followed by direct sequencing across the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif of the major catalytic region in the C domain of the HBV RT enzyme. HBV viral load was performed with Amplicor HBV Monitor test v2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). HBV lamivudine-resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono-infected chronic hepatitis B patients and 10 of 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of HBV lamivudine-resistant strains in therapy-na ve HBV-HIV co-infected patients. The HBV viral loads for mono-infected and co-infected patients ranged from 3.32 x 10(2) to 3.82 x 10(7) and <200 to 4.40 x 10(3) copies/ml, respectively. It remains to be seen whether such pre-existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when lamivudine-containing highly active antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (HAART) regimens become widely applied in South Africa, as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of HBV-HIV co-infected patients.
This work evaluates the antinociceptive and constipating effects of the combination of 3.2 mg/kg s.c. morphine with 177.8 mg/kg s.c. metamizol in acutely and chronically treated (once a day for 12 days) rats. On the 13th day, antinociceptive effects were assessed using a model of inflammatory nociception, pain-induced functional impairment model, and the charcoal meal test was used to evaluate the intestinal transit. Simultaneous administration of morphine with metamizol resulted in a markedly antinociceptive potentiation and an increasing of the duration of action after a single (298+/-7 vs. 139+/-36 units area (ua); P<0.001) and repeated administration (280+/-17 vs. 131+/-22 ua; P<0.001). Antinociceptive effect of morphine was reduced in chronically treated rats (39+/-10 vs. 18+/-5 au) while the combination-induced antinociception was remained similar as an acute treatment (298+/-7 vs. 280+/-17 au). Acute antinociceptive effects of the combination were partially prevented by 3.2 mg/kg naloxone s.c. (P<0.05), suggesting the partial involvement of the opioidergic system in the synergism observed. In independent groups, morphine inhibited the intestinal transit in 48+/-4% and 38+/-4% after acute and chronic treatment, respectively, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the constipating effects. The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by morphine regardless of the time of treatment, suggesting that metamizol did not potentiate morphine-induced constipation. These findings show a significant interaction between morphine and metamizol in chronically treated rats, suggesting that this combination could be useful for the treatment of chronic pain.
Thoracic hematomyelia secondary to coumadin anticoagulant therapy: a case report.
Though uncommon, kidney malformations are described in several cases of Townes-Brocks syndrome. By contrast, kidney failure has been reported as the presenting feature of Townes-Brocks syndrome on only one occasion. While the SALL1 gene, mutations of which result in the Townes-Brocks phenotype, is expressed in the developing kidney, the absence of other corroborative reports of kidney failure presenting in affected individuals suggests that the solitary observation of kidney failure is as likely due to chance as to causal association. In now reporting a further instance of this association, we review the literature, demonstrating that several other instances of kidney failure are in fact known, despite an incomplete dataset. These findings suggest that kidney failure may be a constituent element of the natural history of Townes-Brocks syndrome and raise the possible benefits of longitudinal survey for progressive kidney impairment in patients with this syndrome.
Three cases of EEG changes induced by single exposure to enflurane anesthesia are reported. In one patient, enflurane administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor seizures. Until the cause of the seizures was correctly identified, the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvulsants. Two other patients suffered from partial, complex and generalized seizures uncontrolled by medication. Epileptic foci delineated and activated by enflurane were surgically ablated and the patients are now seizure-free. Previous exposures to enflurane have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the EEG. On the other hand, enflurane may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of epileptic foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings.
Three children are reported with typical cat eye syndrome (CES) and three more children with partial CES because of absence of coloboma, in which the supernumerary marker chromosome was studied by FISH. Using a genomic library, and also a centromeric and particularly a cosmid probe of 22q11, partial tetrasomy was shown in all cases..
Three forms of X-linked spastic paraplegia (SPG) have been defined. One locus (SPG 1) maps to Xq28 while two clinically distinct forms map to Xq22 (SPG2). A rare X-linked dysmyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), has also been mapped to Xq21-q22, and is caused by mutations in the proteolipid protein gene (PLP) which encodes two myelin proteins, PLP and DM20. While narrowing the genetic interval containing SPG2 in a large pedigree, we found that PLP was the closest marker to the disease locus, implicating PLP as a possible candidate gene. We have found that a point mutation (His139Tyr) in exon 3B of an affected male produces a mutant PLP but a normal DM20, and segregates with the disease (Zmax = 6. 63, theta = 0. 00). It appears, therefore, that SPG2 and PMD are allelic disorders
Three human RNA polymerase III-specific subunits form a subcomplex with a selective function in specific transcription initiation.
Three infants, born of two mothers with inflammatory bowel disease who received treatment with sulphasalazine throughout pregnancy, were found to have major congenital anomalies. In the singleton pregnancy, the mother had ulcerative colitis, and the infant, a male, had coarctation of the aorta and a ventricular septal defect. In the twin pregnancy, the mother had Crohn's disease. The first twin, a female, had a left Potter-type IIa polycystic kidney and a rudimentary left uterine cornu. The second twin, a male, had some features of Potter's facies, hypoplastic lungs, absent kidneys and ureters, and talipes equinovarus. Despite reports to the contrary, it is suggested that sulphasalazine may be teratogenic.

Three overlapping cDNA clones covering the entire primary sequence of the bile salt stimulated lipase in human milk were isolated from a human breast lambda gt10 cDNA library by screening with the rat pancreatic cholesterol esterase cDNA. Nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA showed that the human milk lipase mRNA encodes a 748-residue protein, including a 23-residue signal peptide. The human milk lipase cDNA is highly homologous to rat pancreatic cholesterol esterase, suggesting that the milk lipase may be identical to the cholesterol esterase in human pancreas. This conclusion was confirmed by isolation and sequencing of the cDNA for human pancreatic cholesterol esterase. Analysis of the sequence for the human cholesterol esterase/milk lipase revealed similarities to other serine esterases in three distinct regions of the protein. These domains may represent the active site triads of these proteins.
Three patients developed chorea while receiving oral contraceptives. Two were young patients whose chorea developed long after treatment had been started and disappeared soon after it had been discontinued. The third patient had acute amphetamine-induced chorea after prolonged oral contraception. Prolonged administration of female sex hormones is a possible cause of chorea in women who have not previously had chorea or rheumatic fever.
Three patients with ischaemic heart disease developed profound cardiac failure, hypotension and bradycardia during combined therapy with verapamil and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. This clinical picture resolved completely with cessation of the combined therapy. Baseline left ventricular function, assessed by cardiac catheterisation or nuclear angiography, was normal in two patients and only mildly reduced in the other. Simultaneously administration of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs and verapamil may result in profound adverse interactions and should only be administered with great caution.

Thrombotic microangiopathy and renal failure associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy.
Through 30 years of widespread use, acetaminophen has been shown to be a remarkably safe medication in therapeutic dosages. The potential for acetaminophen to produce cardiovascular toxicities is very low. However, acetaminophen has been demonstrated to produce symptoms of anaphylaxis, including hypotension, in sensitive individuals. This article describes two critically ill patients in whom transient episodes of hypotension reproducibly developed after administration of acetaminophen. Other symptoms of allergic reactions were not clinically detectable. The hypotensive episodes were severe enough to require vasopressor administration. The reports illustrate the need for clinicians to consider acetaminophen in patients with hypotension of unknown origin.
Through our transcriptional mapping effort in the Xp22 region, we have isolated by exon trapping a new transcript highly homologous to the Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) gene. rdgC encodes a serine/threonine phosphatase protein and is required in Drosophila to prevent light-induced retinal degeneration. This human gene is the first mammalian member of the serine-threonine phosphatase with EF hand motif gene family, and was thus named PPEF (Protein Phosphatase with EF calcium-binding domain). The expression pattern of the mouse Ppef gene was studied by RNA in situ hybridization on embryonic tissue sections. While rdgC is expressed in the visual system of the fly, as well as in the mushroom bodies of the central brain, we found that Ppef is highly expressed in sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and neural crest-derived cranial ganglia. The selective pattern of expression makes PPEF an important marker for sensory neuron differentiation and suggests a role for serine-threonine phosphatases in mammalian development.

Thyroxine abuse: an unusual case of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy.
Tiapride in levodopa-induced involuntary movements.
Tiapride, a substituted benzamide derivative closely related to metoclopramide, reduced levodopa-induced peak dose involuntary movements in 16 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. However, an unacceptable increase in disability from Parkinsonism with aggravation of end-of-dose akinesia led to its cessation in 14 patients. Tiapride had no effect on levodopa-induced early morning of "off-period" segmental dystonia. These results fail to support the notion that levodopa-induced dyskinesias are caused by overstimulation of a separate group of dopamine receptors.
Tiazofurin is an experimental chemotherapeutic agent currently undergoing clinical evaluation. We report our results with magnetic resonance (MR) in demonstrating reversible cerebral abnormalities concurrent with the use of this drug. The abnormalities on MR were correlated with findings on CT as well as with cerebral angiography. The utility of MR in the evaluation of patients receiving this new agent is illustrated.
Tic disorders can be effectively treated by atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine and ziprasidone. However, there are two case reports that show tic-like symptoms, including motor and phonic variants, occurring during treatment with quetiapine or clozapine. We present a 15-year-old girl schizophrenic who developed frequent involuntary eye-blinking movements after 5 months of amisulpride treatment (1000 mg per day). The tic-like symptoms resolved completely after we reduced the dose of amisulpride down to 800 mg per day. However, her psychosis recurred after the dose reduction. We then placed her on an additional 100 mg per day of quetiapine. She has been in complete remission under the combined medications for more than one year and maintains a fair role function. No more tic-like symptoms or other side effects have been reported. Together with previously reported cases, our patient suggests that tic-like symptoms might occur in certain vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine, clozapine, or amisulpride.

Tincture of Crataegus (TCR), an alcoholic extract of the berries of hawthorn (Crataegus oxycantha), is used in herbal and homeopathic medicine. The present study was done to investigate the protective effect of TCR on experimentally induced myocardial infarction in rats. Pretreatment of TCR, at a dose of 0.5 mL/100 g bodyweight per day, orally for 30 days, prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation and activity of marker enzymes observed in isoproterenol-induced rats (85 mg kg(-1) s. c. for 2 days at an interval of 24 h). TCR prevented the isoproterenol-induced decrease in antioxidant enzymes in the heart and increased the rate of ADP-stimulated oxygen uptake and respiratory coupling ratio. TCR protected against pathological changes induced by isoproterenol in rat heart. The results show that pretreatment with TCR may be useful in preventing the damage induced by isoproterenol in rat heart.
To ascertain the molecular mechanism that causes murine C5 deficiency, genomic and cDNA libraries were constructed from mouse liver DNA and mRNA employing the congenic strains B10. D2/nSnJ and B10. D2/oSnJ that are sufficient and deficient for C5, respectively. Genomic fragments were isolated which correspond to PvuII and HindIII restriction fragment length polymorphisms associated with C5 deficiency. Sequence analyses demonstrated that each of these polymorphisms resulted from single base pair substitutions and that neither substitution would probably cause or contribute to the C5 deficiency. Sequence analyses of C5 sufficient and deficient cDNAs revealed a 2 base-pair deletion in the deficient cDNAs. The " TA " deletion was located near the 5 end of the cDNA. This deletion shifts the reading frame of the C5 mRNA so that the termination codon UGA is present 4 base pairs downstream from the deletion. Genomic DNA was amplified and sequenced corresponding to the area surrounding the 2-base pair deletion. Six C5-deficient strains, A/HeJ, AKR/J, DBA/2J, NZB/B1NJ, SWR/J, and B10. D2/oSnJ, and four C5-sufficient strains, Balb/CJ, C57Bl/6J, DBA/1J, and B10. D2/nSnJ, were analyzed. The sequencing data revealed that the 2 base pairs were deleted from the C5 gene of each deficient mouse tested but not from the C5 gene of any sufficient mouse. These data demonstrate that 1) there is an identical 2-base pair deletion in an exon of the C5 gene in several different C5-deficient mouse strains; 2) the mRNA transcribed from the C5D gene retains this deletion; and 3) this mutation should result in C5 protein deficiency.
To assess the antioxidant effects of atorvastatin (atorva) on dexamethasone (dex)-induced hypertension, 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with atorva 30 mg/kg/day or tap water for 15 days. Dex increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 109 +/- 1.8 to 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg and plasma superoxide (5711 +/- 284.9 saline, 7931 +/- 392.8 U/ml dex, P < 0.001). In this prevention study, SBP in the atorva + dex group was increased from 115 +/- 0.4 to 124 +/- 1.5 mmHg, but this was significantly lower than in the dex-only group (P' < 0.05). Atorva reversed dex-induced hypertension (129 +/- 0.6 mmHg, vs. 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg P' < 0.05) and decreased plasma superoxide (7931 +/- 392.8 dex, 1187 +/- 441.2 atorva + dex, P < 0.0001). Plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) was decreased in dex-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats (11.2 +/- 1.08 microm, 15.3 +/- 1.17 microm, respectively, P < 0.05). Atorva affected neither plasma NOx nor thymus weight. Thus, atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat.
To begin to address the hypothesis that abnormal regulation of the breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 is a critical step in sporadic breast/ovarian tumorigenesis, we have determined the detailed structure of the BRCA1 genomic region. We show that this region of the genome contains a tandem duplication of approximately 30 kilobases, which results in two copies of BRCA1 exons 1 and 2, of exons 1 and 3 of the adjacent 1A1-3B gene and of the previously reported 295 base pair intergenic region. Sequence analysis of the duplicated exons of BRCA1 and 1A1-3B and flanking genomic DNA reveals maintenance of the intron-exon structure and a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity, suggesting that these are non-processed pseudogenes and that the duplication is a recent event in evolutionary terms. We also show that a processed pseudogene of the acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P1 (ARPP1) is inserted directly upstream of pseudo-BRCA1 exon 1A. We believe that these findings could not only confound BRCA1 mutation analysis, but could have implications for the normal and abnormal regulation of BRCA1 transcription, translation and function..
To characterize the nature, time course and dose dependency of zidovudine-related side effects, we undertook a multicenter, prospective, dose-range finding study. Our study group consisted of 74 HIV-positive homosexual men belonging to groups II B, III and IV C2 from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classification of HIV disease. Following a 3-week observation period, volunteers were treated with zidovudine 600 mg/day for 18 weeks, 900 mg/day for 9 weeks and 1200 mg/day for 9 weeks, followed by a washout period of 6 weeks after which they were re-started on 1200 mg/day or the highest tolerated dose at 8-hourly intervals. Subjects were randomly assigned to 4-hourly or 8-hourly regimens within CDC groups while taking 600 and 1200 mg/day. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at 3-week intervals. Symptomatic adverse effects were present in 96% of subjects, most commonly nausea (64%), fatigue (55%) and headache (49%). These were generally self-limited, reappearing briefly at each dose increment. A decrease in hemoglobin occurred shortly after initiation of therapy. This was not dose dependent and reversed rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment. A red blood cell count decrease, a mean cell volume increase and a granulocyte count decrease developed early in a dose-independent fashion, reverting at least partially during the washout phase. The decrease in reticulocyte count was dose related between 600 and 900 mg/day with no further change when the dose was escalated to 1200 mg/day. Bone marrow changes occurred rapidly as demonstrated by megaloblastosis in 95% of 65 specimens at week 18.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
To clarify the effects of bromocriptine on prolactinoma cells in vivo, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to estrogen-induced rat prolactinoma cells 1 h and 6 h after injection of bromocriptine (3 mg/kg of body weight). One h after treatment, serum prolactin levels decreased markedly. Electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules, slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum, and partially dilated Golgi cisternae in the prolactinoma cells. Morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased, while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased. These findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of bromocriptine treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules. At 6 h after injection, serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls. The prolactinoma cells at this time were well granulated, with vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated Golgi cisternae. Electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules, Golgi cisternae, and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat prolactinoma cells. However, only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after bromocriptine treatment of the adenoma cells. An increase in the volume density of secretory granules and a decrease in the volume densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was determined by morphometric analysis, suggesting that bromocriptine inhibits protein synthesis as well as bringing about a disturbance of the prolactin secretion.
To define the possible role of the VHL gene in the development of sporadic renal cell carcinomas, 91 different parenchymal tumours of the kidney have been investigated for mutation of the VHL gene by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and/or heteroduplex (HD) techniques. Chromosome 3p deletion was detected in 98 per cent of non-papillary renal cell carcinomas and in 25 per cent of chromophobe renal cell carcinomas. In 22 of the 43 non-papillary renal cell carcinomas, abnormally migrating DNA bands were detected by SSCP and/or HD analysis. No mobility shift was seen in any of the 23 chromophobe renal cell carcinomas. In addition, 15 papillary renal cell tumours and ten renal oncocytomas, which are characterized by genetic changes other than loss of chromosome 3p sequences, were analysed for mutation of the VHL gene. None of these tumours showed abnormal migration patterns. The results indicate that mutation of the VHL gene is associated exclusively with the development of non-papillary renal cell carcinoma..
To determine the incidence of clinically significant adverse events after long-term, fixed-dose, generic highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use among HIV-infected individuals in South India, we examined the experiences of 3154 HIV-infected individuals who received a minimum of 3 months of generic HAART between February 1996 and December 2006 at a tertiary HIV care referral center in South India. The most common regimens were 3TC + d4T + nevirapine (NVP) (54.8%), zidovudine (AZT) + 3TC + NVP (14.5%), 3TC + d4T + efavirenz (EFV) (20.1%), and AZT + 3TC + EFV (5.4%). The most common adverse events and median CD4 at time of event were rash (15.2%; CD4, 285 cells/microL) and peripheral neuropathy (9.0% and 348 cells/microL). Clinically significant anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) was observed in 5.4% of patients (CD4, 165 cells/microL) and hepatitis (clinical jaundice with alanine aminotransferase > 5 times upper limits of normal) in 3.5% of patients (CD4, 260 cells/microL). Women were significantly more likely to experience lactic acidosis, while men were significantly more likely to experience immune reconstitution syndrome (p < 0.05). Among the patients with 1 year of follow-up, NVP therapy was significantly associated with developing rash and d4T therapy with developing peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.05). Anemia and hepatitis often occur within 12 weeks of initiating generic HAART. Frequent and early monitoring for these toxicities is warranted in developing countries where generic HAART is increasingly available.
To determine the prevalence and characterize demographic, clinical, and genetic features of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) of late onset, all patients experiencing their first FMF attack at age 40 years or more were identified using the computerized registry of our FMF clinic, and then thoroughly interviewed and examined. The control group consisted of 40 consecutive FMF patients, who arrived at the FMF clinic for their regular follow-up visit and were 40 years of age or older at the time of the examination. The severity of the disease in patients and controls was determined using a modified score, developed previously. Mutational analysis in the FMF gene was performed using a commercial kit. Only 20 of 4000 (0. 5%) patients had late-onset FMF. These patients were mostly men, of non-North African origin, P < 0. 05 compared to controls. All had abdominal attacks and in most these were the only manifestation of their disease, P < 0. 001 001. None had chronic or prolonged manifestations of FMF, for example, amyloidosis, chronic arthritis, or protracted myalgia, P < 0. 001. The response to treatment was good despite using low colchicine dose, P < 0. 05. The overall severity score indicated a mild disease, P < 0. 001. Mutational analysis revealed absence of M694V homozygosity, P < 0. 01, compared to our regular FMF population. We conclude that the onset of FMF in a late age defines a milder form of disease with typical clinical, demographic, and molecular genetic characteristics
To determine the prevalence of heart disease in outpatient young asymptomatic chronic cocaine users, 35 cocaine users and 32 age-matched controls underwent resting and exercise electrocardiography (ECG) and Doppler echocardiography. Findings consistent with coronary artery disease were detected in 12 (34%) patients and 3 (9%) controls (p = 0.01). Decreased left ventricular systolic function was demonstrated in 5 (14%) patients, but in none of the controls (p = 0.055). Finally, resting and peak exercise abnormal left ventricular filling was detected in 38 and 35% of patients as compared to 19 and 9% of controls, respectively (p = 0.11 and 0.02, respectively). We conclude that coronary artery or myocardial disease is common (38%) in young asymptomatic chronic cocaine users. Therefore, screening ECG and echocardiography may be warranted in these patients.
To develop a novel and effective drug that could enhance cognitive function and neuroprotection, we newly synthesized maltolyl p-coumarate by the esterification of maltol and p-coumaric acid. In the present study, we investigated whether maltolyl p-coumarate could improve cognitive decline in scopolamine-injected rats and in amyloid beta peptide(1-42)-infused rats. Maltolyl p-coumarate was found to attenuate cognitive deficits in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the amyloid beta peptide(1-42)-infused rats. We also examined the neuroprotective effects of maltolyl p-coumarate in vitro using SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were pretreated with maltolyl p-coumarate, before exposed to amyloid beta peptide(1-42), glutamate or H2O2. We found that maltolyl p-coumarate significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation. Taking these in vitro and in vivo results together, our study suggests that maltolyl p-coumarate is a potentially effective candidate against Alzheimer's disease that is characterized by wide spread neuronal death and progressive decline of cognitive function.
To discover genes involved in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) -mediated carcinogenesis, we used renal cell carcinoma cell lines stably transfected with wild-type VHL-expressing transgenes. Large-scale RNA differential display technology applied to these cell lines identified several differentially expressed genes, including an alpha carbonic anhydrase gene, termed CA12. The deduced protein sequence was classified as a one-pass transmembrane CA possessing an apparently intact catalytic domain in the extracellular CA module. Reintroduced wild-type VHL strongly inhibited the overexpression of the CA12 gene in the parental renal cell carcinoma cell lines. Similar results were obtained with CA9, encoding another transmembrane CA with an intact catalytic domain. Although both domains of the VHL protein contribute to regulation of CA12 expression, the elongin binding domain alone could effectively regulate CA9 expression. We mapped CA12 and CA9 loci to chromosome bands 15q22 and 17q21. 2 respectively, regions prone to amplification in some human cancers. Additional experiments are needed to define the role of CA IX and CA XII enzymes in the regulation of pH in the extracellular microenvironment and its potential impact on cancer cell growth.
To evaluate the effect of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) or trimethaphan (TMP) induced hypotension on epidural blood flow (EBF) during spinal surgery, EBF was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero-lateral interbody fusion under isoflurane anaesthesia. An initial dose of 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 of PGE1 (15 patients), or 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 of TMP (15 patients) was administered intravenously after the dural opening and the dose was adjusted to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at about 60 mmHg. The hypotensive drug was discontinued at the completion of the operative procedure. After starting PGE1 or TMP, MAP and rate pressure product (RPP) decreased significantly compared with preinfusion values (P < 0.01), and the degree of hypotension due to PGE1 remained constant until 60 min after its discontinuation. Heart rate (HR) did not change in either group. EBFF did not change during PGE1 infusion whereas in the TMP group, EBF decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min after the start of TMP (preinfusion: 45.9 +/- 13.9 ml/100g/min. 30 min: 32.3 +/- 9.9 ml/100 g/min (P < 0.05). 60 min: 30 +/- 7.5 ml/100 g/min (P < 0.05)). These results suggest that PGE1 may be preferable to TMP for hypotensive anaesthesia in spinal surgery because TMP decreased EBF.
To examine the relationship between quantitative stimulant drug levels, catecholamines, and psychotic symptoms, nineteen patients in a psychiatric emergency service with a diagnosis of amphetamine- or cocaine-induced psychosis were interviewed, and plasma and urine were collected for quantitative assays of stimulant drug and catecholamine metabolite levels. Methamphetamine or amphetamine levels were related to several psychopathology scores and the global hyperkinesia rating. HVA levels were related to global hyperkinesia but not to psychopathology ratings. Although many other factors such as sensitization may play a role, intensity of stimulant-induced psychotic symptoms and stereotypies appears to be at least in part dose-related.
To facilitate the evaluation of ATM heterozygotes for susceptibility to other diseases, such as breast cancer, we have attempted to define the most common mutations and their frequencies in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) homozygotes from 10 ethnic populations. Both genomic mutations and their effects on cDNA were characterized. Protein-truncation testing of the entire ATM cDNA detected 92 (66%) truncating mutations in 140 mutant alleles screened. The haplotyping of patients with identical mutations indicates that almost all of these represent common ancestry and that very few spontaneously recurring ATM mutations exist. Assays requiring minimal amounts of genomic DNA were designed to allow rapid screening for common ethnic mutations. These rapid assays detected mutations in 76% of Costa Rican patients (3), 50% of Norwegian patients (1), 25% of Polish patients (4), and 14% of Italian patients (1), as well as in patients of Amish/Mennonite and Irish English backgrounds. Additional mutations were observed in Japanese, Utah Mormon, and African American patients. These assays should facilitate screening for A-T heterozygotes in the populations studied..
To identify and early response factor by exposure to ionizing radiation, we cloned the cDNA of a novel Kr ppel-type zinc finger (ZNF) gene, ZK1, from a cDNA library constructed from the human leukemia cell line, CMK86, using degenerate primers. This cDNA encoded a protein of 671 amino acids with an A box of Kr ppel-associated box (KRAB) domain at the N-terminus, followed by 15 ZNF motifs. The expression level of the ZK1 mRNA in human leukemia cells lines, CMK86 and U937, was increased after exposure to ionizing radiation. Furthermore, murine myeloid precursor 32D cells that were stably transfected with ZK1 cDNA had higher sensitivity to ionizing radiation than the 32D parent cells. These data suggest that the ZK1 gene is one of early response genes by exposure to ionizing radiation, and may have some functions on radiation-induced apoptotic cell death on hematopoietic cells.
To identify the genes involved in cervical carcinogenesis, we applied the mRNA differential display (DD) method to analyze normal cervical tissue, cervical cancer, metastatic lymph node, and cervical cancer cell line. We cloned a 491-bp cDNA fragment, CC231, which was present in metastatic tissue and cervical cancer cell line, but absent in normal cervical and cervical cancer tissues. The 491 bp cDNA fragment has 98% homology to the previously published sequence, AAC-11 (antiapoptosis clone 11). The levels of AAC-11 mRNA expressions in nine normal cervical and nine primary cervical cancer tissues were low. Its expression was higher in three metastatic tissues and five cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, CaSki, SiHa, CUMC-3, and CUMC-6). Invasion of matrigel and adhesion to laminin by AAC-11 transfected CUMC-6 cells were increased by approximately 2-fold and 4-fold, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP) genes were found to be expressed in high levels in AAC-11-transfected cancer cells. But MMP-2 and MT1-MMP were not expressed in cells transfected with vector alone or wild-type cells. AAC-11-transfected cells expressed an elevated level of MMP-2 protein as assessed by immunoblotting. On the contrary, tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP-2) expression was detectable in cells transfected with vector alone or wild-type cells, respectively. Its expression was undetectable in AAC-11 transfected cells. In cervical cancer cells transfected with AAC-11, the expression of beta-catenin was up-regulated. These suggest that overexpressions of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, loss of TIMP-2 expression, and up-regulation of beta-catenin by AAC-11 transfection may contribute to the development of cervical cancer invasion. AAC-11 gene transfection increased cervical cancer cell colonization. The effect of AAC-11 on cultured cervical cancer cells was associated with antiapoptotic process. Approximately 50% of the AAC-11 transfected cells in serum-free medium died after 2 weeks, compared to 1 week for vector alone or wild-type cells. These results suggest that AAC-11 may serve as a candidate metastasis-related and apoptosis-inhibiting gene in human cervical cancer.
To identify the risk factors for new-onset seizures after pediatric LT and to assess their clinical implications and long-term prognosis. The clinical and laboratory data of 27 consecutive children who underwent LT from January 2007 to December 2010 in our center were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into seizures group and a non-seizures group. Pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative data were collected. Seizures occurred in four children, an incidence of 14.8%. All exhibited generalized tonic-clonic seizures within the first two wk after LT. Univariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with seizures after pediatric LT included gender, pediatric end-stage liver disease score before surgery, Child-Pugh score before surgery, serum total bilirubin after surgery, and trough TAC level. Multivariate analysis showed that trough TAC level was the only independent risk factor associated with the seizures. All children who experienced seizures survived with good graft function and remained seizure-free without anti-epileptic drugs over a mean follow-up period of 33.7 + 14.6 months. High trough TAC level was the predominant factor that contributed to seizures in the early post-operative period after pediatric LT. High PELD and Child-Pugh scores before LT and high post-operative serum Tbil may be contributory risk factors for TAC-related seizures.
To investigate the initial potassium loss and development of hypokalaemia during the administration of an oral diuretic, metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential hypertension who had shown hypokalaemia under prior oral diuretic treatment. Chlorthalidone (50 mg daily) was given for 14 days. Six patients received a normal-sodium diet and four a low-sodium (17 mmol/day) diet. All patients had a normal initial total body potassium (40K). The electrolyte balances, weight, bromide space, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone secretion rate were measured. In both groups a potassium deficit developed, with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment. In the normal-sodium group the highest mean potassium deficit was 176 mmol on day 9, after which some potassium was regained; in the low-sodium group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13. The normal-sodium group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and aldosterone levels; in the low-sodium group renin and aldosterone increased more slowly but remained elevated. It is concluded that dietary sodium restriction increases diuretic-induced potassium loss, presumably by an increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, while sodium delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased potassium secretion.
To investigate the nature of somatic von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutations, we analyzed 173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas for mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) of DNA. We detected abnormal SSCP pattern in 73 samples. After sequencing, we identified microdeletions in 58% of cases, microinsertions in 17%, nonsense mutations in 8%, and missense mutations in 17%. Among these mutations, 50% correspond to new mutations. VHL mutations were found only in the nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtype, as previously reported. To compare somatic and germline mutations, we used the VHL database, which includes 507 mutations. The study of mutational events revealed a significant difference between somatic and germline mutations with mutations leading to truncated proteins observed in 78% of somatic mutations vs only 37% in germline mutations (P < 0. 001). We postulated that a specific pattern of VHL mutations is associated with sporadic RCC. This pattern corresponds to mutations leading mainly to truncated proteins with few specific missense mutations. We then analyzed the occurrence of RCC in VHL families, based on the nature of mutations. We observed RCC in at least one member of the VHL families in 77% of cases with mutations leading to truncated proteins versus 55% in cases with missense mutations (P < 0. 05). Thus, mutations resulting in truncated proteins may lead to a higher risk of RCC in VHL patients
To investigate the relationship of prostaglandins (PGs) to seizure induction, the effects of six PG synthetase inhibitors on convulsions induced by flurothyl, picrotoxin, pentetrazol (PTZ), electroshock or bicuculline were evaluated. Ibuprofen, sulindac, mefenamic acid, and low dose meclofenamic acid increased the latency-to-onset in the flurothyl and/or PTZ models; the electroshock, picrotoxin and bicuculline models were not significantly affected by any of the pretreatment agents. These results suggest that PGs are involved in the mechanism(s) underlying fluorthyl- and PTZ-induced convulsions, but not picrotoxin-, electroshock-, or bicuculline-induced convulsions.
To quantify the effects of gentamicin, kanamycin and netilmicin on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation, these drugs were administered to rats intraperitoneally (30 mg/kg/day) for 7, 14 or 21 days. Scanning electron microscopy of the glomerular endothelia, urinary measurements of sodium, potassium, endogenous lysozyme, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) as well as clearance and accumulation experiments after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme and measurements of inulin clearance (GFR) were done in each treatment group. Gentamicin administration decreased diameter, density and shape of endothelial fenestrae. Kanamycin and netilmicin appeared to have no effect at the dose used. All three aminoglycosides decreased GFR and increased urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. While gentamicin and kanamycin decreased the percentage reabsorption and accumulation of lysozyme after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme netilmicin had no effect. Daily excretion of total protein, endogenous lysozyme and NAG increased only after treatment with kanamycin and gentamicin. Thus, aminoglycosides may act as nephrotoxicants at glomerular and/or tubular level inducing impairment of renal reabsorption and accumulation of proteins.
To report a sinus bradycardia induced by metoprolol and terbinafine drug-drug interaction and its management. A 63 year-old Caucasian man on metoprolol 200 mg/day for stable coronary artery disease was prescribed a 90-day course of oral terbinafine 250 mg/day for onychomycosis. On the 49th day of terbinafine therapy, he was brought to the emergency room for a decrease of his global health status, confusion and falls. The electrocardiogram revealed a 37 beats/min sinus bradycardia. A score of 7 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the patient's sinus bradycardia and the drug interaction between metoprolol and terbinafine. The heart rate ameliorated first with a decrease in the dose of metoprolol. It was subsequently changed to bisoprolol and the heart rate remained normal. By inhibiting the cytochrome P450 2D6, terbinafine had decreased metoprolol's clearance, leading in metoprolol accumulation which has resulted in clinically significant sinus bradycardia.
To test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of DNA plays an important role in the initiation of carcinogenic process, 5-azacytidine (5-AzC) (10 mg/kg), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens, benzo[a]-pyrene (200 mg/kg), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (60 mg/kg) and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (1,2-DMH) (100 mg/kg). The initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive foci formed following a 2-week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene coupled with a necrogenic dose of CCl4. The results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens, administration of 5-AzC during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes, for example 10-20 foci/cm2 in 5-AzC and carcinogen-treated rats compared with 3-5 foci/cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen only. Administration of [3H]-5-azadeoxycytidine during the repair synthesis induced by 1,2-DMH further showed that 0.019 mol % of cytosine residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue, indicating that incorporation of 5-AzC occurs during repair synthesis. In the absence of the carcinogen, 5-AzC given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy, when its incorporation should be maximum, failed to induce any gamma-GT positive foci. The results suggest that hypomethylation of DNA per se may not be sufficient for initiation. Perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation, the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hypomethylation of DNA.
To understand the role of the CCAAT-binding factor, CBF, in transcription, we developed a strategy to purify the heterotrimeric CBF complex from HeLa cell extracts using two successive immunoaffinity chromatography steps. Here we show that the p32 protein, previously identified as the ASF/SF2 splicing factor-associated protein, copurified with the CBF complex. Studies of protein-protein interaction demonstrated that p32 interacts specifically with CBF-B subunit and also associates with CBF-DNA complex. Cellular localization by immunofluorescence staining revealed that p32 is present in the cell throughout the cytosol and nucleus, whereas CBF is present primarily in the nucleus. A portion of the p32 colocalizes with CBF-B in the nucleus. Interestingly, reconstitution of p32 in an in vitro transcription reaction demonstrated that p32 specifically inhibits CBF-mediated transcription activation. Altogether, our study identified p32 as a novel and specific corepressor of CBF-mediated transcription activation in vitro.
Tolerability of lomustine in combination with cyclophosphamide in dogs with lymphoma.
Tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients with NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema.
Tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin in patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever.
Tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin was studied in 6 patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) of more than 8 days of evolution. Administration of ribavirin resulted in a neutralization of viremia and a drop of endogenous interferon titers. The average time of death was delayed. A reversible anemia was the only adverse effect observed. From these results, we conclude that ribavirin has an antiviral effect in advanced cases of AHF, and that anemia, the only secondary reaction observed, can be easily managed. The possible beneficial effect of ribavirin during the initial days of AHF is discussed.

Tonotopic organization is an essential feature of the primary auditory area (A1) of primate cortex. In A1 of macaque monkeys, low frequencies are represented rostrolaterally and high frequencies are represented caudomedially. The purpose of this study was to determine if changes occur in this tonotopic organization following cochlear hearing loss. Under anesthesia, the superior temporal gyrus of adult macaque monkeys was exposed, and the tonotopic organization of A1 was mapped using conventional microelectrode recording techniques. Following recovery, the monkeys were selectively deafened for high frequencies using kanamycin and furosemide. The actual frequencies deafened were determined by the loss of tone-burst elicited auditory brainstem responses. Three months after deafening, A1 was remapped. Postmortem cytoarchitectural features identifying A1 were correlated with the electrophysiologic data. The results indicate that the deprived area of A1 undergoes extensive reorganization and becomes responsive to intact cochlear frequencies. The region of cortex that represents the low frequencies was not obviously affected by the cochlear hearing loss.
Topical 0.025% capsaicin in chronic post-herpetic neuralgia: efficacy, predictors of response and long-term course.
Topiramate is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating refractory seizures. Urologists should be aware that this medication can cause metabolic acidosis in patients secondary to inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. In addition, a distal tubular acidification defect may result, thus impairing the normal compensatory drop in urine pH. These factors can lead to the development of calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis. We report the first two cases of topiramate-induced nephrolithiasis in the urologic literature.

Total blindness with a transient tonic pupillary response, denervation supersensitivity, and abnormal visual-evoked potentials developed in a 54-year-old man after the use of quinine sulfate for leg cramps. He later recovered normal visual acuity. A transient tonic pupillary response, denervation supersensitivity, and abnormal visual-evoked potentials in quinine toxicity, to our knowledge, have not been previously reported.
Total colourblindness (OMIM 216900), also referred to as rod monochromacy (RM) or complete achromatopsia, is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited and congenital disorder characterized by photophobia, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus and the complete inability to discriminate between colours. Electroretinographic recordings show that in RM, rod photoreceptor function is normal, whereas cone photoreceptor responses are absent. The locus for RM has been mapped to chromosome 2q11 (ref. 2), however the gene underlying RM has not yet been identified. Recently, a suitable candidate gene, CNGA3, encoding the alpha-subunit of the cone photoreceptor cGMP-gated cation channel, a key component of the phototransduction pathway, has been cloned and assigned to human chromosome 2q11 (refs 3,4). We report the identification of missense mutations in CNGA3 in five families with RM. Homozygous mutations are present in two families, whereas the remaining families show compound heterozygous mutations. In all cases, the segregation pattern of the mutations is consistent with the autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease and all mutations affect amino acids that are highly conserved among cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNG) in various species. This is the first report of a colour vision disorder caused by defects other than mutations in the cone pigment genes, and implies at least in this instance a common genetic basis for phototransduction in the three different cone photoreceptors of the human retina.

Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) is an autosomal dominant malformation syndrome characterized by renal, anal, ear, and thumb anomalies caused by SALL1 mutations. To date, 36 SALL1 mutations have been described in TBS patients. All but three of those, namely p.R276X, p.S372X, and c.1404dupG, have been found only in single families thereby preventing phenotype-genotype correlations. Here we present 20 novel mutations (12 short deletions, five short duplications, three nonsense mutations) in 20 unrelated families. We delineate the phenotypes and report previously unknown ocular manifestations, i.e. congenital cataracts with unilateral microphthalmia. We show that 46 out of the now 56 SALL1 mutations are located between the coding regions for the glutamine-rich domain mediating SALL protein interactions and 65 bp 3' of the coding region for the first double zinc finger domain, narrowing the SALL1 mutational hotspot region to a stretch of 802 bp within exon 2. Of note, only two SALL1 mutations would result in truncated proteins without the glutamine-rich domain, one of which is reported here. The latter is associated with anal, ear, hand, and renal manifestations, indicating that the glutamine-rich domain is not required for typical TBS.
Townes-Brocks syndrome: twenty novel SALL1 mutations in sporadic and familial cases and refinement of the SALL1 hot spot region.
Toxic actions of flurazepam (FZP) were studied in cats, mice and rats. High doses caused an apparent central excitation, most clearly seen as clonic convulsions, superimposed on general depression. Following a lethal dose, death was always associated with convulsions. Comparing the relative sensitivity to central depression and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have convulsions at doses that did not first cause loss of consciousness, while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory actions. Signs of FZP toxocity in cats included excessive salivation, extreme apprehensive behavior, retching, muscle tremors and convulsions. An interaction between FZP and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was shown by pretreating mice with FZP before PTZ challenge. As a function of dose, FZP first protected against convulsions and death. At higher doses, however, convulsions again emerged. These doses of FZP were lower than those that would alone cause convulsions. These results may be relevant to the use of FZP in clinical situations in which there is increased neural excitability, such as epilepsy or sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal.

Toxic peripheral neuropathy is still a significant limiting factor for chemotherapy with paclitaxel (PAC), although glutamate and its closely related amino acid glutamine were claimed to ameliorate PAC neurotoxicity. This pilot trial aimed to evaluate the role of glutamate supplementation for preventing PAC-induced peripheral neuropathy in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical and electro-diagnostic study. Forty-three ovarian cancer patients were available for analysis following six cycles of the same PAC-containing regimen: 23 had been supplemented by glutamate all along the treatment period, at a daily dose of three times 500 mg (group G), and 20 had received a placebo (group P). Patients were evaluated by neurological examinations, questionnaires and sensory-motor nerve conduction studies. There was no significant difference in the frequency of signs or symptoms between the two groups although neurotoxicity symptoms presented mostly with lower scores of severity in group G. However, this difference reached statistical significance only with regard to reported pain sensation (P = 0.011). Also the frequency of abnormal electro-diagnostic findings showed similarity between the two groups (G: 7/23 = 30.4%; P: 6/20 = 30%). This pilot study leads to the conclusion that glutamate supplementation at the chosen regimen fails to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of PAC.

Tramadol is a weak opioid with effects on adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission that is used to treat cancer pain and chronic non malignant pain. This drug was initiated in association with paroxetine and dosulepine hydrochloride in a tetraparetic patient with chronic pain. Fifty-six days after initiation of the treatment the patient presented hallucinations that only stopped after the withdrawal of psycho-active drugs and tramadol. The case report questions the long term use of pain killers combined with psycho-active drugs in chronic non malignant pain, especially if pain is under control.
Tranexamic acid overdosage-induced generalized seizure in renal failure.
Transcription by RNA polymerase III involves recruitment of the polymerase by template-bound accessory factors, followed by initiation, elongation, and termination steps. An immunopurification approach has been used to demonstrate that human RNA Pol III is composed of 16 subunits, some of which are apparently modified in HeLa cells. Partial denaturing conditions and sucrose gradient sedimentation at high salt result in the dissociation of a subcomplex that includes hRPC32, hRPC39, and hRPC62. Cognate cDNAs were isolated and shown to encode three subunits that are specific to RNA Pol III and homologous to three yeast subunits. The human RNA Pol III core lacking the subcomplex functions in transcription elongation and termination following nonspecific initiation on a tailed template, but fails to show promoter-dependent transcription initiation in conjunction with accessory factors. The capability for specific transcription initiation can be restored either by the natural subcomplex or by a stable subcomplex composed of recombinant hRPC32, hRPC39, and hRPC62 polypeptides. One component (hRPC39) of this subcomplex interacts physically with both hTBP and hTFIIIB90, two subunits of human RNA Pol III transcription initiation factor IIIB. These data strongly suggest that the hRPC32-hRPC39-hRPC62 subcomplex directs RNA Pol III binding to the TFIIIB-DNA complex via the interactions between TFIIIB and hRPC39.
Transforming growth factor-beta TGF-beta is the prototype for a family of extracellular proteins that affect cell proliferation and tissue differentiation. TGF-beta-related factors, including BMP-2/4, Dpp and activin, act through two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors which can form a heteromeric complex. However, the mechanism of signal transduction by these receptors is largely unknown. In Drosophila, Mad is required for signalling by Dpp. We have isolated complementary DNAs for four human Mad homologues, one of which, hMAD-4, is identical to DPC-4, a candidate tumour suppressor. hMAD-3 and -4 synergized to induce strong ligand-independent TGF-beta-like responses. When truncated at their carboxy termini, hMAD-3 and -4 act as dominant-negative inhibitors of the normal TGF-beta response. The activity of hMAD-3 and -4 was regulated by the TGF-beta receptors, and hMAD-3 but not hMAD-4 was phosphorylated and associated with the ligand-bound receptor complex. These results define hMAD-3 and -4 as effectors of the TGF-beta response and demonstrate a function for DPCA-4/hMAD-4 as a tumour suppressor.

Transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome was first described in Japan as "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy." This syndrome has been identified in many other countries. Many variations of this syndrome have been recently described in the literature. One of the rarest is the reverse type of this syndrome, with hyperdynamic apex and complete akinesia of the base (as opposed to the classic apical ballooning). In this article, we report an interesting case of a young woman who presented with this rare type of reverse apical ballooning syndrome occurring after amphetamine use. This report is followed by review of the literature.

Translocations involving chromosomal region 19q13 are a frequent finding in follicular adenomas of the thyroid and might represent the most frequent type of structural aberration in human epithelial tumors. By positional cloning, a putative candidate gene, ZNF331 (formerly RITA) located close to the breakpoint was identified. Recently, aberrant expression of ZNF331 has been described in two cell lines of follicular thyroid adenomas with aberrations in 19q13 indicating an involvement of ZNF331 in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, knowledge about structure and expression of ZNF331 is limited. We performed RACE-PCR and genomic sequence analyses to gain a deeper insight into its molecular structure. To elucidate ZNF331 expression patterns we performed Northern blot analyses on various normal tissues as well as on thyroid carcinoma and adenoma cell lines. Herein, unique expression of a 3.4-kbp transcript is described in thyroid adenoma cell lines with 19q13 aberrations, which was not detected either in normal tissues or in thyroid carcinoma cell lines.

Transporter-facilitated uptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) has been implicated in anxiety in humans and animal models and is the site of action of widely used uptake-inhibiting antidepressant and antianxiety drugs. Human 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) gene transcription is modulated by a common polymorphism in its upstream regulatory region. The short variant of the polymorphism reduces the transcriptional efficiency of the 5-HTT gene promoter, resulting in decreased 5-HTT expression and 5-HT uptake in lymphoblasts. Association studies in two independent samples totaling 505 individuals revealed that the 5-HTT polymorphism accounts for 3 to 4 percent of total variation and 7 to 9 percent of inherited variance in anxiety-related personality traits in individuals as well as sibships..
Transvenous right ventricular pacing during cardiopulmonary resuscitation of pediatric patients with acute cardiomyopathy.
Treatment for scabies is usually initiated by general practitioners; most consider lindane (gamma benzene hexachloride) the treatment of choice. Lindane is also widely used as an agricultural and industrial pesticide, and as a result the toxic profile of this insecticide is well understood. Evidence is accumulating that lindane can be toxic to the central nervous system and may be associated with aplastic anaemia. Preparations containing lindane continue to be sold over the counter and may represent a hazard to poorly informed patients. This literature review suggests that general practitioners should prescribe scabicides with increased caution for certain at-risk groups, and give adequate warnings regarding potential toxicity.

Treatments by oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) alone, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) alone, and combination of the two drugs were attempted for 7 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CDCA treatment at a dose of 300 mg/day reduced serum cholestanol (67. 3% reduction), lathosterol (50. 8%), campesterol (61. 7%) and sitosterol (12. 7%). However, the sera of the patients changed to be " atherogenic "; total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol were increased, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol was decreased. Contrarily, pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day improved the sera of the patients to be markedly " anti-atherogenic ", but the reductions of cholestanol (30. 4%), lathosterol (44. 0%), campesterol (22. 9%) and sitosterol (9. 6%) were inadequate. Combined treatment with CDCA and pravastatin showed good overlapping of the effects of each drug alone. The sera of the patients were apparently more " anti-atherogenic " than those after CDCA treatment. Serum cholestanol concentration was still 2. 7 times higher than in controls, but the serum lathosterol level was within the normal range, indicating that the enhancement of overall cholesterol synthesis in the patients was sufficiently suppressed. Plant sterol levels were also within the normal range. The combination of CDCA and pravastatin was a good treatment for CTX, based on the improvement of serum lipoprotein metabolism, the suppression of cholesterol synthesis, and reductions of cholestanol and plant sterol levels. In all of 7 patients, the progression of disease was arrested, but dramatic effects on clinical manifestations, xanthoma, and electrophysiological findings could not be found after the treatment of these drugs
Tremor side effects of salbutamol, quantified by a laser pointer technique.
Tri-ortho-tolyl phosphate (TOTP), 360 mg/kg, po, and 0,0'-diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP), 1 mg/kg sc, were administered to adult White Leghorn chickens 24 hr after they were placed on diets containing 0 to 300 ppm corticosterone. Supplemented diets were continued until clinical signs and lesions of delayed neuropathy appeared. Although low concentrations (less than or equal to 50 ppm) of corticosterone had beneficial effects on TOTP-induced neuropathy, greater than or equal to 200 ppm exacerbated clinical signs in chickens given either TOTP or DFP. Neurotoxic esterase activities 24 hr after TOTP or DFP were less than 20% of values measured in chickens not given organophosphorous compounds. Chickens given 200 ppm corticosterone without TOTP or DFP had significantly elevated activity of plasma cholinesterase and significantly inhibited activity of liver carboxylesterase. Degenerating myelinated fibers were also evident in distal levels of the peripheral nerves of chickens given TOTP or DFP.

Trimipramine (TRI), which shows a clinical antidepressant activity, is chemically related to imipramine but does not inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine, nor does it induce beta-adrenergic down-regulation. The mechanism of its antidepressant activity is still unknown. The aim of the present study was to find out whether TRI given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1-adrenergic systems, demonstrated by us previously for various antidepressants. TRI was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days. In the acute experiment TRI (given i.p.) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5-hydroxytryptophan head twitches in rats. TRI given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor hyperactivity induced by d-amphetamine, quinpirole and (+)-7-hydroxy-dipropyloaminotetralin (dopamine D2 and D3 effects). The stereotypies induced by d-amphetamine or apomorphine are not potentiated by TRI. It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine (given intraventricularly) in rats, evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in mice, both these effects being mediated by an alpha1-adrenergic receptor. It may be concluded that, like other tricyclic antidepressants studied previously, TRI given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain dopamine D2 and D3 (locomotor activity but not stereotypy) as well as alpha1-adrenergic receptors to their agonists. A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated antidepressants, suggested to be responsible for the antidepressant activity.

TrkC is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by neurotrophin-3, a factor important in the development of certain areas of the central nervous system. We have cloned and sequenced the human trkC cDNA and found that the predicted amino acid sequence is 97 to 98% homologous to the rat and porcine trkC sequences, respectively. The rat trkC has several isoforms due to alternative splicing in the tyrosine kinase domain. We cloned one human splice variant that has a nucleic acid sequence identical to the rat isoform with an insert of 14 amino acids. The human trkC cDNA also has a (CGG)n repeat in the 5'-untranslated region. This sequence was not highly polymorphic in that 79 of 80 chromosomes examined had eight repeats, while 1 chromosome had four repeats. By PCR analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and fluorescence in situ hybridization with the cDNA clone, human trkC was mapped to chromosome 15q24-q25.
Truncation mutations in the transactivation region of PAX6 result in dominant-negative mutants.
Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder marked by hamartoma growth in multiple organ systems. We performed mutational analyses on 325 individuals with definite tuberous sclerosis complex diagnostic status. We identified mutations in 72% (199/257) of de novo and 77% (53/68) of familial cases, with 17% of mutations in the TSC1 gene and 50% in the TSC2 gene. There were 4% unclassified variants and 29% with no mutation identified. Genotype/phenotype analyses of all observed tuberous sclerosis complex findings in probands were performed, including several clinical features not analyzed in two previous large studies. We showed that patients with TSC2 mutations have significantly more hypomelanotic macules and learning disability in contrast to those with TSC1 mutations, findings not noted in previous studies. We also observed results consistent with two similar studies suggesting that individuals with mutations in TSC2 have more severe symptoms. On performing meta-analyses of our data and the other two largest studies in the literature, we found significant correlations for several features that individual studies did not have sufficient power to conclude. Male patients showed more frequent neurologic and eye symptoms, renal cysts, and ungual fibromas. Correlating genotypes with phenotypes should facilitate the disease management of tuberous sclerosis complex.
Tuftelin has been suggested to play an important role during the development and mineralization of enamel, but its precise function is still unclear. This article reviews major milestones in the discovery, structural characterization, expression, localization, and conservation of tuftelin in different vertebrate species. It focuses on the structure of the human tuftelin gene, which has recently been deciphered . It describes the exon-intron organization, sizes and structure, the promoter structure, and the newly discovered alternatively spliced human tooth-bud tuftelin mRNA transcripts. It also examines information on the structural motifs in the human-derived tuftelin protein and how they relate to tuftelin from other species. It reviews our recent results on the transcription of tuftelin mRNA and protein expression in several nonmineralizing soft tissues, using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by DNA cloning and sequencing, indirect immunohistochemistry, immunohistochemistry combined with confocal microscopy, and in situ hybridization. These results and earlier Northern blot results show that tuftelin, in addition to being expressed in the developing and mineralizing tooth, is also expressed in several nonmineralizing soft tissues, suggesting that tuftelin has a universal function and/or a multifunctional role.
Tumor associated antigen recognition by autologous serum in patients with breast cancer.
Tumor suppression and apoptosis of human prostate carcinoma mediated by a genetic locus within human chromosome 10pter-q11.
Tumour progression is regulated by the balance of proliferation and apoptosis in the tumour cell population. To date, the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumour growth has been attributed to the induction of angiogenesis. VEGF has been shown to be a survival factor for endothelial cells, preventing apoptosis by inducing Bcl-2 expression. In both murine (4T1) and human (MDA-MB-231) metastatic mammary carcinoma cell lines, we found that VEGF upregulated Bcl-2 expression and anti-VEGF antibodies reduced Bcl-2 expression. These alterations in Bcl-2 expression were reflected by the levels of tumour cell apoptosis. VEGF resulted in reduced tumour cell apoptosis, whereas its inhibition with anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies induced apoptosis directly in tumour cells. Therefore, in addition to its role in angiogenesis and vessel permeability, VEGF acts as a survival factor for tumour cells, inducing Bcl-2 expression and inhibiting tumour cell apoptosis.
Twelve aniridia patients, five with a family history and seven presumed to be sporadic, were exhaustively screened in order to test what proportion of people with aniridia, uncomplicated by associated anomalies, carry mutations in the human PAX6 gene. Mutations were detected in 90% of the cases. Three mutation detection techniques were used to determine if one method was superior for this gene. The protein truncation test (PTT) was used on RT-PCR products, SSCP on genomic PCR amplifications, and chemical cleavage of mismatch on both RT-PCR and genomic amplifications. For RT-PCR products, only the translated portion of the gene was screened. On genomic products exons 1 to 13 (including 740 bp of the 3 untranslated sequence and all intron/exon boundaries) were screened, as was a neuroretina specific enhancer in intron 4. Ten of the possible 12 mutations in the five familial cases and five of the sporadic patients were found, all of which conformed to a functional outcome of haploinsufficiency. Five were splice site mutations (one in the donor site of intron 4, two in the donor site of intron 6, one in each of the acceptor sites of introns 8 and 9) and five were nonsense mutations in exons 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. SSCP analysis of individually amplified exons, with which nine of the 10 mutations were seen, was the most useful detection method for PAX6..
Twelve patients with liver disease related to methyldopa were seen between 1967 and 1977. Illness occurred within 1--9 weeks of commencement of therapy in 9 patients, the remaining 3 patients having received the drug for 13 months, 15 months and 7 years before experiencing symptoms. Jaundice with tender hepatomegaly, usually preceded by symptoms of malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and associated with upper abdominal pain, was an invariable finding in all patients. Biochemical liver function tests indicated hepatocellular necrosis and correlated with histopathological evidence of hepatic injury, the spectrum of which ranged from fatty change and focal hepatocellular necrosis to massive hepatic necrosis. Most patients showed moderate to severe acute hepatitis or chronic active hepatitis with associated cholestasis. The drug was withdrawn on presentation to hospital in 11 patients, with rapid clinical improvement in 9. One patient died, having presented in hepatic failure, and another, who had been taking methyldopa for 7 years, showed slower clinical and biochemical resolution over a period of several months. The remaining patient in the series developed fulminant hepatitis when the drug was accidentally recommenced 1 year after a prior episode of methyldopa-induced hepatitis. In this latter patient, and in 2 others, the causal relationship between methyldopa and hepatic dysfunction was proved with the recurrence of hepatitis within 2 weeks of re-exposure to the drug.
Twenty children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed meningeal disease were treated with a high-dose intravenous methotrexate regimen that was designed to achieve and maintain CSF methotrexate concentrations of 10(-5) mol/L without the need for concomitant intrathecal dosing. The methotrexate was administered as a loading dose of 6,000 mg/m2 for a period of one hour followed by an infusion of 1,200 mg/m2/h for 23 hours. Leucovorin rescue was initiated 12 hours after the end of the infusion with a loading dose of 200 mg/m2 followed by 12 mg/m2 every three hours for six doses and then every six hours until the plasma methotrexate level decreased to less than 1 X 10(-7) mol/L. The mean steady-state plasma and CSF methotrexate concentrations achieved were 1.1 X 10(-3) mol/L and 3.6 X 10(-5) mol/L, respectively. All 20 patients responded to this regimen, 16/20 (80%) achieved a complete remission, and 20% obtained a partial remission. The most common toxicities encountered were transient serum transaminase and bilirubin elevations, neutropenia, and mucositis. One patient had focal seizures and transient hemiparesis but recovered completely. High-dose intravenous methotrexate is an effective treatment for the induction of remission after meningeal relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Twenty common migraine patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of nitroglycerin (10 patients) or placebo ointment (10 patients) in a double blind study. Early onset migraine attacks were induced by nitroglycerin in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group. Subsequently 20 migraine patients, who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal nitroglycerin, received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas. No early onset migraine was observed. Thus the migraine-inducing effect of nitroglycerin seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of pain, suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a migraine crisis. This is not consistent with a CNS origin of migraine attack.
Twenty patients received 27 courses of ifosfamide administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 14 days without Mesna. The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of ifosfamide that would be comparable to standard bolus or short-term infusions administered with Mesna. Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300, 400, 450, 500, and 550 mg/m2/d. Four patients developed transient microscopic hematuria at 400, 450, and 500 mg/m2/d. There were no instances of macroscopic hematuria. At 550 mg/m2/d, three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity; confusion (1), nausea (1), and Grade 2 leukopenia (1). The recommended dose of 500 mg/m2/d delivers a total dose of 7 g/m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short-term infusion. Because few patients received multiple courses over time, the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial. The frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential, adding Mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent hematuria. The protracted infusion schedule for ifosfamide permits convenient outpatient administration without Mesna and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to 890 per cycle. Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient, but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained.
Twenty single-nucleotide polymorphisms in four genes encoding cardiac ion channels.
Twenty-five patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who developed toxicity while taking remission inducing drugs and 30 without toxicity were studied for possible associations with class I and II HLA antigens. A strong association has been found between nephritis and dermatitis due to Tiopronin (a D-Penicillamine like compound) and class I antigens B35-Cw4, and between dermatitis due to gold thiosulphate and B35. Compared to healthy controls a lower DR5 frequency was observed in patients with RA except for the Tiopronin related nephritis group.
Twenty-six cases of Reye syndrome from The Children's Hospital, Camperdown, Australia, occurring between 1973 and 1982 were reviewed. Of these, 20 cases met the US Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control criteria for the diagnosis of Reye syndrome. Aspirin or salicylate ingestion had occurred in only one of the 20 cases (5%), and paracetamol (acetaminophen) had been administered in only six of the cases (30%). Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of Reye syndrome was accomplished in 90% of the cases. The incidence of Reye syndrome in New South Wales, Australia, is estimated from this study to be approximately nine cases per 1 million children compared with recent US data of ten to 20 cases per 1 million children and three to seven cases per 1 million children in Great Britain. The mortality for these Reye syndrome cases in Australia was 45% as compared with a 32% case-fatality rate in the United States. In Australia, the pediatric usage of aspirin has been extremely low for the past 25 years (less than 1% of total dosage units sold), with paracetamol (acetaminophen) dominating the pediatric analgesic and antipyretic market. Reye syndrome may be disappearing from Australia despite a total lack of association with salicylates or aspirin ingestion, since there were no cases found at The Children's Hospital in 1983, 1984, or 1985.
Twenty-three hours after heart transplantation, life-threatening acute right heart failure was diagnosed in a patient requiring continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). Increasing doses of catecholamines, sedatives, and muscle relaxants administered through a central venous catheter were ineffective. However, a bolus of epinephrine injected through an alternative catheter provoked a hypertensive crisis. Thus, interference with the central venous infusion by the dialysis catheter was suspected. The catheters were changed, and hemodynamics stabilized at lower catecholamine doses. When the effects of IV drugs are inadequate in patients receiving CVVHDF, interference with adjacent catheters resulting in elimination of the drug by CVVHDF should be suspected.
Twin preterm neonates with cardiac toxicity related to lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.
Two brothers, 6 and 13 years old, had histidinemia. On the basis of clinical and biochemical observations, the younger boy was considered to have a classical type of the disease, while the older boy had an atypical form characterized by partial impairment of the skin histidase activity and a moderately prolonged half-life of blood histidine. The mother is a heterozygous carrier, while the father and sister seem to be normal..
Two cases of amisulpride overdose: a cause for prolonged QT syndrome.
Two cases of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina detected at follow-up in young women exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol are reported. One patient, aged 23, had been followed for 2 years before carcinoma was diagnosed; the second patient, aged 22, had been seen on a regular basis for 5 years, 8 months. In both instances, suspicion of the presence of carcinoma was aroused by the palpation of a small nodule in the vaginal fornix. Hysterosalpingography was performed on both patients and, in 1 instance, an abnormal x-ray film was reflected by the gross appearance of the uterine cavity found in the surgical specimen.
Two cases of deliberate self-poisoning with 5 g and 3.6 g of amisulpride, respectively, are reported. In both cases, QT prolongation and hypocalcaemia were noted. The QT prolongation appeared to respond to administration of i.v. calcium gluconate.
Two cases of downbeat nystagmus and oscillopsia associated with carbamazepine.
Two cases of hepatic adenoma and one of focal nodular hyperplasia presumably associated with the use of oral contraceptives, are reported. Special reference is made to their clinical presentation, which may be totally asymptomatic. Liver-function tests are of little diagnostic value, but valuable information may be obtained from both liver scanning and hepatic angiography. Histologic differences and clinical similarities between hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver are discussed.
Two cases of postinfarction ventricular septal rupture in patients on long-term steroid therapy are presented and the favourable outcome in both cases described. A possible association between steroid therapy and subsequent postinfarction septal rupture is discussed.
Two cases of propylthiouracil-associated acute hepatitis, one case of fatal methimazole-associated hepatocellular necrosis and one case of propylthiouracil-associated lupus-like syndrome are described. The literature related to antithyroid drug side effects and the mechanisms for their occurrence are reviewed and the efficacy and complications of thyroidectomy and radioiodine compared to those of antithyroid drugs. It is concluded that in most circumstances 131I is the therapy of choice for hyperthyroidism.
Two cases of propylthiouracil-induced liver damage have been observed. The first case is of an acute type of damage, proven by rechallenge; the second presents a clinical and histologic picture resembling chronic active hepatitis, with spontaneous remission.
Two cases of severe delayed neurologic toxicity related to the administration of intrathecal (IT) combination chemotherapy including thiotepa (TSPA) are presented. Both cases developed axonal neuropathy with motor predominance in the lower extremities 1 and 6 months after IT chemotherapy was administered. Neurologic toxicities have been described with IT-methotrexate, IT-cytosine arabinoside and IT-TSPA. To our knowledge, however, axonal neuropathy following administration of these three agents has not been previously described. In spite of the fact that TSPA is a useful IT agent, its combination with MTX, ara-C and radiotherapy could cause severe neurotoxicity. This unexpected complication indicates the need for further toxicology research on IT-TSPA.
Two children with Wilms tumor of the left kidney experienced severe anthracycline cardiomyopathy after irradiation to the tumor bed and conventional dosage of doxorubicin. The cardiomyopathy is attributed 1) to the fact that radiation fields for left Wilms tumor include the lower portion of the heart and 2) to the interaction of doxorubicin and irradiation on cardiac muscle. It is recommended that doxorubicin dosage be sharply restricted in children with Wilms tumor of the left kidney who receive postoperative irradiation.
Two closely related human nuclear export factors utilize entirely distinct export pathways.
Two distinct loci have been proposed for aniridia; AN1 for autosomal dominant aniridia on chromosome 2p and AN2 for the aniridia in the WAGR contiguous gene syndrome on chromosome 11p13. In this report, the kindred segregating for autosomal dominant aniridia, which suggested linkage to acid phosphatase-1 (ACP1) and led to the assignment of the AN1 locus on chromosome 2p, has been updated and expanded. Linkage analysis between the aniridia phenotype and ACP1 does not support the original linkage results, excluding linkage up to theta = 0. 17 with Z = -2. Tests for linkage to other chromosome 2p markers. APOB, D2S71, D2S5, and D2S1, also excluded linkage to aniridia. Markers that have been isolated from the chromosome 11p13 region were then analyzed in this aniridia family. Two RFLPs at the D11S323 locus give significant evidence for linkage. The PvuII polymorphism detected by probe p5S1. 6 detects no recombinants, with a maximum lod score of Z = 6. 97 at theta = 0. 00 00. The HaeIII polymorphism detected by the probe p5BE1. 2 gives a maximum lod score of Z = 2. 57 at theta = 0. 00 00. Locus D11S325 gives a lod score of Z = 1. 53 at theta = 0. 00 00. These data suggest that a locus for aniridia (AN1) on chromosome 2p has been misassigned and that this autosomal dominant aniridia family is segregating for an aniridia mutation linked to markers in the 11p13 region.
Two distinct mutations at a single BamHI site in phenylketonuria.
Two elderly patients with a history of either cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or head trauma and no evidence of renal disease developed seizures while receiving maximum doses of imipenem/cilastatin. Neither patient had reported previous seizures or seizure-like activity nor was receiving anticonvulsant agents. All seizures were controlled with therapeutic doses of phenytoin. Both patients had received maximum doses of other beta-lactam antibiotics without evidence of seizure activity.
Two frequent missense mutations in Pendred syndrome.
Two full-length cDNAs, DNLC2A and DNLC2B, were cloned and characterized. Their open reading frames respectively encode 96 amino acids which are most closely homologous to roadblock/LC7, one member of an ancient dynein light chain protein family, conserved in nematode, fruit fly, mouse and rat. The DNLC2A was expressed in 12 of 16 human tissues examined, with especially strong expression in heart, liver and brain, whereas there was weak expression in lung, prostate, testis, small intestine and colon. The expression of DNLC2B was generally high compared with that of DNLC2A except in liver. Northern blotting and/or semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis examined the expression changes of DNLC2A and DNLC2B in 68 hepatocellular carcinoma tissue samples. It was revealed that DNLC2A was up-regulated (45 out of the 68 cases) while DNLC2B was down-regulated (44 out of 68 cases), compared with their adjacent tumor-free liver tissues. Interestingly, among the total 68 liver cancer samples tested, DNLC2A was up-regulated while DNLC2B was down-regulated in 28 cases; DNLC2A was up-regulated while no obvious change was observed for DNLC2B in 10 cases; no obvious change was observed for DNLC2A while DNLC2B was down-regulated in 14 cases. Although the underlying mechanism is not clear to date, the apparent up-regulation of DNLC2A and down-regulation of DNLC2B suggest that these genes might be involved in tumor progression. On the other hand, the different expression changes of the two homologous genes indicate that hepatocellular carcinomas are caused by different pathological mechanisms. In addition, DNLC2A was assigned to human chromosome 20q12-q13.11 near the marker D20S106 by radiation hybrid mapping.
Two genes were identified and characterized that express cDNAs related to previously identified neurotransmitter and/or osmolyte transporters, but which are expressed specifically in the kidney. RNA transcribed from one of these two genes (XT2) was found to undergo an extensive degree of alternative splicing to generate six distinct isoforms. The intron-exon structure of the XT2 gene and the sites of alternative splicing were identified. Expression of the second gene (XT3) was found to be conserved in human kidney, and partial sequence was obtained from a human cDNA library. The expressions of both XT2 and XT3 RNAs were determined in mouse and human tissues, respectively, and the locations of the two genes within the mouse genome were identified. Screening experiments to identify the substrate(s) of these proteins failed to identify specific uptake with any of the tested compounds; however, immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated that epitope-tagged variants of the protein products of the XT2 and XT3 cDNAs were present on the plasma membrane of transfected cells.
Two halogenated anesthetics, enflurane and isoflurane, have been associated with an allergic-type hepatic injury both alone and following previous exposure to halothane. Halothane hepatitis appears to involve an aberrant immune response. An antibody response to a protein-bound biotransformation product (trifluoroacetyl adduct) has been detected on halothane hepatitis patients. This study was performed to determine cross-reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane. The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by halothane-induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane, and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models. Enflurane administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver. In the same liver, biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20-fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats. This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and/or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or subsequent to halothane administration. The guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens.
Two human cDNA clones (HHO.c1.95 and HHO.c8.5111) containing a homeobox region have been characterized, and the respective genomic regions have been partially analyzed. Expression of the corresponding genes, termed c1 and c8, was evaluated in different organs and body parts during human embryonic/fetal development. HHO.c1.95 apparently encodes a 217-amino acid protein containing a class I homeodomain that shares 60 out of 61 amino acid residues with the Antennapedia homeodomain of Drosophila melanogaster. HHO.c8.5111 encodes a 153-amino acid protein containing a homeodomain identical to that of the frog AC1 gene. Clones HHO.c1 and HHO.c8 detect by blot-hydridization one and two specific polyadenylylated transcripts, respectively. These are differentially expressed in spinal cord, backbone rudiments, limb buds (or limbs), heart, and skin of human embryos and early fetuses in the 5- to 9-week postfertilization period, thus suggesting that the c1 and c8 genes play a key role in a variety of developmental processes. Together, the results of the embryonic/fetal expression of c1 and c8 and those of two previously analyzed genes (c10 and c13) indicate a coherent pattern of expression of these genes in early human ontogeny.
Two human homeobox genes, c1 and c8: structure analysis and expression in embryonic development.
Two male subjects are described, with unusual clinical presentations and with hitherto undescribed G6PD variants. The first, of Italian extraction, suffered from severe neonatal jaundice following maternal ingestion of fresh broad beans (Vicia fava) both prenatally and postnatally the expression of the enzymatic defect was much more severe in the neonatal period than on retesting in adolescence, when biochemical characterization showed unique features which justify designation as a new variant Gd (+) Alexandra. The second patient, a boy of Maltese extraction who was found to have bilateral lamellar cataracts at the age of 4 years, was identified as G6PD deficient only as a result of a survey of children of Mediterranean origin with unexplained cataract formation; he has approximately 15% of normal enzyme activity, with another unique combination of biochemical characteristics which has led to its designation as Gd (-) Camperdown. Although this association may be coincidental, it prompts further attention to the possibility that under certain circumstances G6PD deficiency may favor cataract formation. The two cases illustrate the value of characterization of the mutant enzyme whenever unexpected clinical or laboratory results are obtained..
Two missense mutations causing mild hyperphenylalaninemia associated with DNA haplotype 12.
Two mothers with heart valve prosthesis were treated with warfarin during pregnancy. In the first case a caesarean section was done one week after replacement of warfarin with heparin. The baby died of cerebral and pulmonary hemorrhage. The second mother had a male infant by caesarean section. The baby showed warfarin-induced embryopathy with nasal hypoplasia and stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata). Nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses has now been reported in 11 infants born to mothers treated with warfarin during the first trimester, and a causal association is probable. In view of the risks to both mother and fetus in women with prosthetic cardiac valves it is recommended that therapeutic abortion be advised as the first alternative.
Two mouse lines selected for differential sensitivities to beta-carboline-induced seizures are also differentially sensitive to various pharmacological effects of other GABA(A) receptor ligands.
Two mouse lines were selectively bred according to their sensitivity (BS line) or resistance (BR line) to seizures induced by a single i.p. injection of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), an inverse agonist of the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine site. Our aim was to characterize both lines' sensitivities to various physiological effects of other ligands of the GABA(A) receptor. We measured diazepam-induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus-maze test, diazepam-induced sedation by recording the vigilance states, and picrotoxin- and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures after i.p. injections. Results presented here show that the differential sensitivities of BS and BR lines to beta-CCM can be extended to diazepam, picrotoxin, and pentylenetetrazol, suggesting a genetic selection of a general sensitivity and resistance to several ligands of the GABA(A) receptor.
Two multigravida patients with no prior psychiatric history were seen with postpartum psychosis, having received bromocriptine for inhibition of lactation. Bromocriptine given in high doses has been associated with psychosis in patients receiving the drug for Parkinson's disease. These cases demonstrate that bromocriptine may cause psychosis even when given in low doses.
Two neonates suffered from generalized seizures during the course of intravenous morphine sulfate for post-operative analgesia. They received morphine in doses of 32 micrograms/kg/hr and 40 micrograms/kg/hr larger than a group of 10 neonates who received 6-24 micrograms/kg/hr and had no seizures. Plasma concentrations of morphine in these neonates was excessive (60 and 90 mg/ml). Other known reasons for seizures were ruled out and the convulsions stopped a few hours after cessation of morphine and did not reoccur in the subsequent 8 months. It is suggested that post-operative intravenous morphine should not exceed 20 micrograms/kg/ml in neonates.
Two new UDP-glucuronosyltransferase cDNAs, designated UGT2B10 and UGT2B11, encoding 528 amino acid proteins were isolated from a human liver cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequences of UGTs 2B10 and 2B11 share > 76% sequence similarity with other known human liver UGT2B subfamily isoforms and < 48% sequence similarity with UGT1 family proteins. COS-7 cells transfected with UGT 2B10 and 2B11 synthesized proteins with respective molecular masses of 49kDa and 51kDa. UGT2B11 expressed in COS-7 cells glucuronidated a number of polyhydroxylated estrogens (estriol, 4-hydroxyestrone and 2-hydroxyestriol) and xenobiotics (4-methylumbelliferone, 1-naphthol, 4-nitrophenol, 2-aminophenol, 4-hydroxybiphenyl and menthol). Despite the screening of more than forty potential substrates, glucuronidation activity was not observed for expressed UGT2B10.
Two new arylsulfatase A (ARSA) mutations in a juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) patient.
Two new deficient variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) causing hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) are described. Both of these are unique and they have been named G6PD Wayne and G6PD Huron. Patients with G6PD Wayne underwent splenectomy and no objective improvement was noted. The patients with G6PD Huron were under medical observation for a considerable period of time without the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency being entertained because the family was of Northern European origin. Since sporadic variants of G6PD causing HNSHA show no special racial predilection, the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency should always be considered in patients with this syndrome..
Two new variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase associated with hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia: G6PD Wayne and G6PD Huron.
Two of 14 patients with Cushing's syndrome treated on a long-term basis with ketoconazole developed sustained hypertension. In both cases normal plasma and urinary free cortisol levels had been achieved following ketoconazole therapy, yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated hypertension 31 (patient 1) and 52 weeks (patient 2) after treatment. In patient 1, plasma levels of deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol were elevated. In patient 2, in addition to an increase in both deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol levels, plasma aldosterone values were raised, with a concomitant suppression of renin levels. Our findings show that long-term treatment with high doses of ketoconazole may induce enzyme blockade leading to mineralocorticoid-related hypertension.
Two overlapping cDNA clones (1, 991 bp and 736 bp, respectively) encoding the precursor of human mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD) were cloned and sequenced. The cDNA inserts of these clones together encompass a region of 2, 177 bases, encoding the entire protein of 655 amino acids, including a 40-amino acid leader peptide and a 615-amino acid mature polypeptide. PCR-amplified VLCAD cDNAs were sequenced in cultured fibroblasts from two VLCAD-deficient patients. In both patients, a 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182 in VLCAD cDNA was identified. The deletion seems to occur due to exon skipping during processing of VLCAD pre-mRNA. This is the first demonstration of a mutation causing VLCAD deficiency. Quantitative cDNA expression of normal human VLCAD was performed in the patients fibroblasts, using vaccinia viral system, which demonstrated that the deficiency of the normal VLCAD protein causes impaired long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation activity in the patients fibroblasts. In patient fibroblasts, raising VLCAD activity to approximately 20% of normal control fibroblast activity raised palmitic acid beta-oxidation flux to the level found in control fibroblasts, which may offer important information for the rational design of future somatic gene therapy for VLCAD deficiency..
Two patients developed acute tubular necrosis, characterized clinically by acute oliguric renal failure, while they were receiving a combination of cephalothin sodium and gentamicin sulfate therapy. Patients who are given this drug regimen should be observed very carefully for early signs of nephrotoxicity. High doses of this antibiotic combination should be avoided especially in elderly patients. Patients with renal insufficiency should not be given this regimen.
Two patients treated with parenteral paramethasone (Triniol) and dexamethasone (Sedionbel) are described. A few minutes after administration of the drugs, they presented urticaria (patients 1 and 2) and conjunctivitis (patient 1). The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients' reactions, the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid. Clinical examinations and skin, oral and parenteral challenges with different corticosteroids and ELISA tests were performed. In the two patients, skin and ELISA tests with paramethasone were negative, as was the prick test with each of its excipients. A single-blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug, and negative with its excipients. We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other corticosteroids and found intolerance to some of them. These results suggest that paramethasone caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients. Corticosteroids different from paramethasone also produced hypersensitivity reactions in these patients; however, a few of them were tolerated. The basic mechanisms of those reactions are not yet fully understood. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pseudo-allergy caused by paramethasone.
Two patients with signs of carbamazepine neurotoxicity after combined treatment with verapamil showed complete recovery after discontinuation of the calcium entry blocker. Use of verapamil in combination with carbamazepine should either be avoided or prescribed only with appropriate adjustment of the carbamazepine dose (usually reduction of the carbamazepine dose by one half).
Two patients with similar clinical features are presented: both patients had chronic renal failure, on hemodialysis for many years but recently begun on a high-flux dialyzer; both had been receiving a carbidopa/levodopa preparation; and both had the onset of hallucinosis and recurrent seizures, which were refractory to anticonvulsants. The first patient died without a diagnosis; the second patient had a dramatic recovery following the administration of vitamin B6. Neither patient was considered to have a renal state sufficiently severe enough to explain their presentation.
Two peroxisomal targeting signals, PTS1 and PTS2, are involved in the import of proteins into the peroxisome matrix. Human patients with fatal generalized peroxisomal deficiency disorders fall into at least nine genetic complementation groups. Cells from many of these patients are deficient in the import of PTS1-containing proteins, but the causes of the protein-import defect in these patients are unknown. We have cloned and sequenced the human cDNA homologue (PTS1R) of the Pichia pastoris PAS8 gene, the PTS1 receptor (McCollum, D., E. Monosov, and S. Subramani. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 121 761-774). The PTS1R mRNA is expressed in all human tissues examined. Antibodies to the human PTS1R recognize this protein in human, monkey, rat, and hamster cells. The protein is localized mainly in the cytosol but is also found to be associated with peroxisomes. Part of the peroxisomal PTS1R protein is tightly bound to the peroxisomal membrane. Antibodies to PTS1R inhibit peroxisomal protein-import of PTS1-containing proteins in a permeabilized CHO cell system. In vitro-translated PTS1R protein specifically binds a serine-lysine-leucine-peptide. A PAS8-PTS1R fusion protein complements the P. pastoris pas8 mutant. The PTS1R cDNA also complements the PTS1 protein-import defect in skin fibroblasts from patients--belonging to complementation group two--diagnosed as having neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy or Zellweger syndrome. The PTS1R gene has been localized to a chromosomal location where no other peroxisomal disorder genes are known to map. Our findings represent the only case in which the molecular basis of the protein-import deficiency in human peroxisomal disorders is understood.

Two point mutations are responsible for G6PD polymorphism in Sardinia.
Two pregnancies at risk for Wolman disease were monitored by assay and electrophoresis of acid lipase in cultured amniotic-fluid cells. Cells from patient 1 had 5% of control levels of acid lipase, using 14C-triolein as substrate; however, when artificial substrates (esters of 4-methylumbelliferone and p-nitrophenol) were used to measure acid lipase, these cells had 30% of control levels. Electrophoresis of cell extracts revealed the absence of the A form of acid lipase, consistent with the diagnosis of Wolman disease. Analysis of fetal tissues following prostaglandin termination of this pregnancy confirmed the diagnosis. Assay of fetal-skin fibroblasts with 14C-triolein, as well as with artificial substrates, showed marked deficiency of acid lipase activity. Electrophoresis of fetal-tissue extracts also demonstrated the absence of the A form of acid lipase. Amniotic-fluid cells from patient 2 showed normal levels of acid lipase with all substrates tested; the electrophoretic pattern of acid lipase was normal. The results suggest that the prenatal diagnosis of Wolman disease be made using the radioassay of acid lipase and/or electrophoresis..
Two prodrugs of potent and selective GluR5 kainate receptor antagonists actives in three animal models of pain.
Two proteins which specifically bind tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have recently been isolated from human urine in our laboratory. The two proteins cross-react immunologically with two species of cell surface TNF receptors (TNF-R). Antibodies against one of the two TNF binding proteins (TBPI) were found to have effects characteristic of TNF, including stimulating phosphorylation of specific cellular proteins. Oligonucleotide probes designed on the basis of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of TBPI were used to clone the cDNA for the structurally related cell surface type 1 TNF-R. It is notable that although this receptor can signal the phosphorylation of cellular proteins, it appears from its amino acid sequence to be devoid of intrinsic protein kinase activity. The extracellular domain of the receptor is composed of four internal cysteine-rich repeats, homologous to structures repeated four times in the extracellular domains of the nerve growth factor receptor and the B lymphocytes surface antigen CDw40. The amino acid composition and size of the extracellular domain of the type I TNF-R closely resemble those of TBPI. The COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of the four cysteine rich repeats within the extracellular domain of the type I TNF-R matches the COOH-terminal sequence of TBPI. Amino acid sequences in the extracellular domain also fully match other sequences found in TBPI. On the other hand, amino acid sequences in the soluble form of the type II TNF-R (TBPII), while indicating a marked homology of structure, did not suggest any identity between this protein and the extracellular domain of the type I TNF-R. CHO cells transfected with type I TNF-R cDNA produced both cell surface and soluble forms of the receptor. The receptor produced by CHO cells was recognized by several monoclonal antibodies against TBPI, reacting with several distinct epitopes in this molecule. These data suggest that the soluble forms of the TNF-Rs are structurally identical to the extracellular cytokine binding domains of these receptors and are consistent with the notion that the soluble forms are, at least partly, derived from the same transcripts that encode the cell surface receptors.
Two proteins with seven transmembrane-spanning domains typical of guanosine-nucleotide-binding-protein-coupled receptors have been identified as cannabinoid receptors; the central cannabinoid receptor, CB1, and the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, CB2, initially described in rat brain and spleen, respectively. Here, we report the distribution patterns for both CB1 and CB2 transcripts in human immune cells and in several human tissues, as analysed using a highly sensitive and quantitative PCR-based method. CB1 was mainly expressed in the central nervous system and, to a lower extent, in several peripheral tissues such as adrenal gland, heart, lung, prostate, uterus, ovary, testis, bone marrow, thymus and tonsils. In contrast, the CB2 gene, which is not expressed in the brain, was particularly abundant in immune tissues, with an expression level 10-100-fold higher than that of CB1. Although CB2 mRNA was also detected in some other peripheral tissues, its level remained very low. In spleen and tonsils, the CB2 mRNA content was equivalent to that of CB1 mRNA in the central nervous system. Among the main human blood cell subpopulations, the distribution pattern of the CB2 mRNA displayed important variations. The rank order of CB2 mRNA levels in these cells was B-cells > natural killer cells >> monocytes > polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells > T8 cells > T4 cells. The same rank order was also established in human cell lines belonging to the myeloid, monocytic and lymphoid lineages. The prevailing expression of the CB2 gene in immune tissues was confirmed by Northern-blot analysis. In addition, the expression of the CB2 protein was demonstrated by an immunohistological analysis performed on tonsil sections using specific anti-(human CB2) IgG; this experiment showed that CB2 expression was restricted to B-lymphocyte-enriched areas of the mantle of secondary lymphoid follicles. These results suggest that (a) CB1 and CB2 can be considered as tissue-selective antigens of the central nervous system and immune system, respectively, and (b) cannabinoids may exert specific receptor-mediated actions on the immune system through the CB2 receptor.
Two recent studies have suggested the involvement of serum amyloid A (SAA) and P (APCS) genes in familial Mediterranean fever (MEF). To test the role of SAA and APCS in MEF and MEF-amyloidosis, we studied 17 informative families (15 Armenians, 2 non-Ashkenazi Jews) and 8 MEF patients with amyloidosis using a candidate gene approach. No evidence for any MEF-associated polymorphism was found in any of the 41 Armenian and Jewish MEF patients tested. Our family studies allowed us to rule out tight linkage between SAA and MEF (lod score = -2. 16, theta less than or equal to 0. 06). For APCS we found that the allele frequency in the MEF-amyloidosis patients was similar to that in 18 unrelated MEF patients without amyloidosis and their 33 healthy parents.
Two schizophrenic patients, who had a prior history of LSD abuse and who had previously developed EPS with classic antipsychotics, were successfully treated with risperidone. They both reported short episodes of transient visual disturbances, which appeared immediately after starting treatment with risperidone. This imagery resembled visual disturbances previously experienced as "flashbacks" related to prior LSD consumption. Risperidone administration was continued and the visual disturbances gradually wore off. During a six-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of visual disturbances. This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign, short-term and self-limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of risperidone or interfere with treatment. Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution.
Two siblings with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and several family members were found with heterozygous C2 deficiency. An association with histocompatibility markers HLA-B18 and HLA-Dw2 was demonstrated, and the slow allotype of factor B was present. Linkage studies in this family suggested a close linkage between the C2 deficiency gene and genes coding for B18, Dw2, and BfS antigens. One HLA-ACB/DBf recombinant was observed showing closer linkage between HLA-D and Bf than between HLA-B and Bf..
Two variants of a genetic deficiency of complement protein C2 (C2D) have been previously identified. No C2 protein translation is detected in type I deficiency, while type II deficiency is characterized by a selective block in C2 secretion. Type I C2 deficiency was described in a family in which the C2 null allele (C2Q0) is associated with the major histocompatibility haplotype/complotype HLA-A25, B18, C2Q0, BfS, C4A4, C4B2, Drw2; this extended haplotype occurs in over 90% of C2-deficient individuals (common complotype/haplotype). To determine the molecular basis of type I C2 deficiency, the C2 gene and cDNA were characterized from a homozygous type I C2-deficient individual with the common associated haplotype/complotype. We found a 28-base pair deletion in the type I C2Q0 gene, beginning 9 base pairs upstream of the 3-end of exon 6, that generates a C2 transcript with a complete deletion of exon 6 (134 base pair) and a premature termination codon. In studies of eight kindred, the 28-base pair deletion was observed in all C2Q0 alleles associated with the common type I deficient complotype/haplotype; this deletion was not present in normal C2 nor in type II C2-deficient genes. These data demonstrate that 1) type I human complement C2 deficiency is caused by a 28-base pair genomic deletion that causes skipping of exon 6 during RNA splicing, resulting in generation of a premature termination codon, 2) the 28-base pair deletion in the type I C2Q0 gene is strongly associated with the HLA haplotype/complotype A25, B18, C2Q0, BfS, C4A4, C4B2, Drw2, suggesting that all C2-deficient individuals with this haplotype/complotype will harbor the 28-base pair C2 gene deletion, and 3) type II C2 deficiency is caused by a different, as yet uncharacterized, molecular genetic defect..
Two well-documented cases of bilateral retinal artery and choriocapillaris occlusions with blindness following head and neck soft-tissue injection with methylprednisolone acetate in combination with lidocaine, epinephrine, or penicillin are reported. One case had only a unilateral injection. The acute observations included hazy sensorium, superior gaze palsy, pupillary abnormalities, and conjunctival hemorrhages with edema. Follow-up changes showed marked visual loss, constricted visual fields, optic nerve pallor, vascular attenuation, and chorioretinal atrophy. The literature is reviewed, and possible causes are discussed.
Two yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) spanning a total distance of 1. 1 megabase pairs of DNA around the MCC (for mutated in colorectal carcinoma) and APC (for adenomatous polyposis coli) genes at 5q21 have been isolated and characterized. Starting from the MCC gene, a strategy was undertaken to identify constitutional submicroscopic deletions in familial adenomatous polyposis patients that might considerably narrow down the position of the APC gene. To this end, YACs identified by the MCC gene were screened across a chromosome 5-specific cosmid library to provide a source of DNA probes for genomic scanning. The cosmids isolated from these experiments were used to screen a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing chromosome 5 segregated from patients suspected to carry putative interstitial deletions. This screening approach led to the confirmation of a small heterozygous deletion in a polyposis patient that overlaps one of the two isolated YACs. This YAC has been shown to contain the entire APC gene, in addition to a significant portion of DNA flanking the 5 end of the gene, and should therefore prove a valuable resource for functional studies by transfer to colorectal tumor-derived cell lines.
Two-amino acid molecular switch in an epithelial morphogen that regulates binding to two distinct receptors.
Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography combined with high-sensitive cardiac troponin T in early detection and prediction of cardiotoxicity during epirubicine-based chemotherapy.
Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD), a non-neuronopathic lysosomal storage disorder, results from the deficient activity of acid beta-glucosidase (GBA). Type 1 disease is panethnic but is more prevalent in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent. Of the causative GBA mutations, N370S is particularly frequent in the AJ population, (q approximately. 03), whereas the 84GG insertion (q approximately. 003) occurs exclusively in the Ashkenazim. To investigate the genetic history of these mutations in the AJ population, short tandem repeat (STR) markers were used to map a 9. 3-cM region containing the GBA locus and to genotype 261 AJ N370S chromosomes, 60 European non-Jewish N370S chromosomes, and 62 AJ 84GG chromosomes. A highly conserved haplotype at four markers flanking GBA (PKLR, D1S1595, D1S2721, and D1S2777) was observed on both the AJ chromosomes and the non-Jewish N370S chromosomes, suggesting the occurrence of a founder common to both populations. Of note, the presence of different divergent haplotypes suggested the occurrence of de novo, recurrent N370S mutations. In contrast, a different conserved haplotype at these markers was identified on the 84GG chromosomes, which was unique to the AJ population. On the basis of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) delta values, the non-Jewish European N370S chromosomes had greater haplotype diversity and less LD at the markers flanking the conserved haplotype than did the AJ N370S chromosomes. This finding is consistent with the presence of the N370S mutation in the non-Jewish European population prior to the founding of the AJ population. Coalescence analyses for the N370S and 84GG mutations estimated similar coalescence times, of 48 and 55.5 generations ago, respectively. The results of these studies are consistent with a significant bottleneck occurring in the AJ population during the first millennium, when the population became established in Europe.
Type B hepatitis after needle-stick exposure: prevention with hepatitis B immune globulin. Final report of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study.
Type I human complement C2 deficiency. A 28-base pair gene deletion causes skipping of exon 6 during RNA splicing.
Type I von Willebrand disease (vWD) is characterized by equally low plasma concentrations of von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF Ag) and ristocetin cofactor (RiCof) and by the presence of all vWF multimers in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -agarose gel electrophoresis. For 17 patients (13 kindreds) diagnosed with these criteria, we have studied the platelet contents of vWF Ag and RiCof and the changes of these in plasma after DDAVP infusion. Platelet vWF Ag and RiCof were normal in four kindreds (called " platelet normal " subgroup); following 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin; plasma vWF Ag, RiCof and the bleeding time (BT) became normal. In six kindreds, platelet vWF Ag and RiCof were equally low (platelet low); after DDAVP, plasma vWF Ag and RiCof remained low, and the BT was prolonged. In three additional kindreds, platelets contained normal concentrations of vWF Ag, but RiCof was very low (platelet discordant); even though a complete set of multimers was found in plasma and platelets, there was a relatively small amount of large multimers. After DDAVP, plasma vWF Ag became normal, but RiCof remained low and the BT was very prolonged. These findings demonstrated that there can be an abnormal vWF (RiCof less than vWF Ag) even in type I vWD, coexisting with a complete set of vWF multimers (platelet discordant); that the abnormal vWF can be shown more clearly in platelets than in plasma or else in plasma after DDAVP infusion; and that DDAVP normalizes the BT only in those patients with normal platelet levels of both vWF Ag and RiCof (platelet normal)..
Type II complement protein C2 deficiency is characterized by a selective block in C2 secretion. The Type II C2 null allele (C2Q0) is linked to two major histocompatibility haplotypes (MHC) that differ from the MHC of the more common Type I C2 deficiency. To determine the molecular basis of Type II deficiency the two Type II C2Q0 genes were isolated and transfected separately into L-cells. Subsequent molecular biology, biosynthetic, and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that C2 secretion is impaired in Type II C2 deficiency because of different missense mutations at highly conserved residues in each of the C2Q0 alleles. One is in exon 5 (nucleotide C566 -- > T; Ser189 -- > Phe) of the C2Q0 gene linked to the MHC haplotype A11, B35, DRw1, BFS, C4A0B1. The other is in exon 11 (G1930 -- > A; Gly444 -- > Arg) of the C2Q0 gene linked to the MHC haplotype A2, B5, DRw4, BFS, C4A3B1. Each mutant C2 gene product is retained early in the secretory pathway. These mutants provide models for elucidating the C2 secretory pathway..
Type II human complement C2 deficiency. Allele-specific amino acid substitutions (Ser189 --> Phe; Gly444 --> Arg) cause impaired C2 secretion.
Type III collagen is a fibrillar forming collagen comprising three alpha1 (III) chains and is expressed in early embryos and throughout embryogenesis. In the adult, type III collagen is a major component of the extracellular matrix in a variety of internal organs and skin. Mutations in the COL3A1 gene have been implicated as a cause of type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a disease leading to aortic rupture in early adult life. To directly study the role of Col3a1 in development and disease, we have inactivated the Col3a1 gene in embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination. The mutated allele was transmitted through the mouse germ line and homozygous mutant animals were derived from heterozygous intercrosses. About 10% of the homozygous mutant animals survived to adulthood but have a much shorter life span compared with wild-type mice. The major cause of death of mutant mice was rupture of the major blood vessels, similar to patients with type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Ultrastructural analysis of tissues from mutant mice revealed that type III collagen is essential for normal collagen I fibrillogenesis in the cardiovascular system and other organs..
Type III collagen is crucial for collagen I fibrillogenesis and for normal cardiovascular development.
Type-A receptors for the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission. Each subunit of the pentameric receptor protein has ligand-binding sites in the amino-terminal extracellular domain and four membrane-spanning regions, one of which forms a wall of the ion channel. Each subunit also has a large intracellular loop that may be a target for protein kinases and be required for subcellular targeting and membrane clustering of the receptor, perhaps by anchoring the receptor to the cytoskeleton. Neurotransmitter receptors need to be positioned in high density in the cell membrane at sites postsynaptic to nerve terminals releasing that neurotransmitter. Other members of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion-channel receptors associate in postsynaptic-membrane clusters by binding to the proteins rapsyn or gephyrin. Here we identify a new cellular protein, GABA(A)-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), which can interact with the gamma2 subunit of GABA(A) receptors. GABARAP binds to GABA(A) receptors both in vitro and in vivo, and co-localizes with the punctate staining of GABA(A) receptors on cultured cortical neurons. Sequence analysis shows similarity between GABARAP and light chain-3 of microtubule-associated proteins 1A and 1B. Moreover, the N terminus of GABARAP is highly positively charged and features a putative tubulin-binding motif. The interactions among GABA(A) receptors, GABARAP and tubulin suggest a mechanism for the targeting and clustering of GABA(A) receptors.
Typical and partial cat eye syndrome: identification of the marker chromosome by FISH.
ULBPs, novel MHC class I-related molecules, bind to CMV glycoprotein UL16 and stimulate NK cytotoxicity through the NKG2D receptor.
UM-272 (N,N-dimethylpropranolol), a quaternary antiarrhythmic agent, was administered sublingually to dogs with ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardias. Both anti-arrhythmic efficacy and bioavailability were compared to oral drug. Sublingual UM-272 converted ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm in all 5 dogs. The area under the plasma concentration time curve at 90 min was 4-12 times greater than for oral drug, suggesting the existence of an absorption-limiting process in the intestine, and providing an alternate form of administration for quaternary drugs.
UNASSIGNED: Epidemiological studies of 1,3-butadiene have suggest that exposures to humans are associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CML has a well-documented association with ionizing radiation, but reports of associations with chemical exposures have been questioned. Ionizing radiation is capable of inducing the requisite CML-associated t(9:22) translocation (Philadelphia chromosome) in appropriate cells in vitro but, thus far, chemicals have not shown this capacity. We have proposed that 1,3-butadiene metabolites be so tested as a reality check on the epidemiological reports. In order to conduct reliable testing in this regard, it is essential that a positive control for induction be available. We have used ionizing radiation to develop such a control. Results described here demonstrate that this agent does in fact induce pathogenic t(9:22) translocations in a human myeloid cell line in vitro, but does so at low frequencies. Conditions that will be required for studies of 1,3-butadiene are discussed.
UNASSIGNED: Metolachlor, a widely used herbicide, is classified as a Group C carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency based on increased liver neoplasms in female rats. Epidemiologic studies of the health effects of metolachlor have been limited. The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is a prospective cohort study including licensed private and commercial pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina enrolled 1993-1997. We evaluated cancer incidence through 2010/2011 (NC/IA) for 49,616 applicators, 53% of whom reported ever using metolachlor. We used Poisson regression to evaluate relations between two metrics of metolachlor use (lifetime days, intensity-weighted lifetime days) and cancer incidence. We saw no association between metolachlor use and incidence of all cancers combined (n = 5,701 with a 5-year lag) or most site-specific cancers. For liver cancer, in analyses restricted to exposed workers, elevations observed at higher categories of use were not statistically significant. However, trends for both lifetime and intensity-weighted lifetime days of metolachor use were positive and statistically significant with an unexposed reference group. A similar pattern was observed for follicular cell lymphoma, but no other lymphoma subtypes. An earlier suggestion of increased lung cancer risk at high levels of metolachlor use in this cohort was not confirmed in this update. This suggestion of an association between metolachlor and liver cancer among pesticide applicators is a novel finding and echoes observation of increased liver neoplasms in some animal studies. However, our findings for both liver cancer and follicular cell lymphoma warrant follow-up to better differentiate effects of metolachlor use from other factors.
UNASSIGNED: Our previous study has indicated that prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) could induce intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) of offspring. Recent research suggested that IUGR is a risk factor for glomerulosclerosis. However, whether PCE could induce glomerulosclerosis and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This study aimed to demonstrate the induction to glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring by PCE and its intrauterine programming mechanisms. A rat model of IUGR was established by PCE, male fetuses and adult offspring at the age of postnatal week 24 were euthanized. The results revealed that the adult offspring kidneys in the PCE group exhibited glomerulosclerosis as well as interstitial fibrosis, accompanied by elevated levels of serum creatinine and urine protein. Renal angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2R) gene expression in adult offspring was reduced by PCE, whereas the renal angiotensin II receptor type 1a (AT1aR)/AT2R expression ratio was increased. The fetal kidneys in the PCE group displayed an enlarged Bowman's space and a shrunken glomerular tuft, accompanied by a reduced cortex width and an increase in the nephrogenic zone/cortical zone ratio. Observation by electronic microscope revealed structural damage of podocytes; the reduced expression level of podocyte marker genes, nephrin and podocin, was also detected by q-PCR. Moreover, AT2R gene and protein expressions in fetal kidneys were inhibited by PCE, associated with the repression of the gene expression of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)/tyrosine kinase receptor (c-Ret) signaling pathway. These results demonstrated that PCE could induce dysplasia of fetal kidneys as well as glomerulosclerosis of adult offspring, and the low functional programming of renal AT2R might mediate the developmental origin of adult glomerulosclerosis.

UVB radiation induces human lens epithelial cell migration via NADPH oxidase-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases.
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is one of the important cataract risk factors. The migration of human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) plays a crucial role in the remodeling of lens capsule and cataract formation. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of UV-induced lens cell migration. We found that UVB radiation induces cell migration in cultured human lens epithelial cells. Further, we observed that UVB radiation induces NADPH oxidase activity and ROS generation which are inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium or DPI and antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). In addition, DPI and EGCG also block UVB irradiation-induced MMP-2, and -9 activity and expression and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Collectively, our data suggest that NADPH oxidase may be a major source for the UVB-induced ROS generation, and it plays an essential role in the activation of NF-kappaB, which is involved in the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and cell migration induced by UVB in HELCs. Understanding the cell signaling pathways may constitute potential therapeutic targets in for UVB-induced cataract.
Uncoupling of hypomyelination and glial cell death by a mutation in the proteolipid protein gene.
Under controlled conditions, infant rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations during extreme cold exposure and after administration of the alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine. Previous investigations have determined that, in response to clonidine, ultrasound production increases through the 2nd-week postpartum and decreases thereafter. Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern, and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia, we hypothesized that clonidine's developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other. Therefore, in the present experiment, the effects of clonidine administration (0.5 mg/kg) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2-, 8-, 15-, and 20-day-old rats. Age-related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables, including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine-induced bradycardia. This experiment is discussed with regard to the hypothesis that ultrasound production is the acoustic by-product of a physiological maneuver that compensates for clonidine's detrimental effects on cardiovascular function.
Under many physiological circumstances, Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent, hemicholinium-3 (HC-3)-sensitive, high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) in cholinergic neurons is thought to be rate-limiting in the biosynthesis of acetylcholine (ACh). Based on sequence information provided by the Human Genome Project and the recently reported rat CHT1 (rCHT1), we cloned a human CHT cDNA from spinal cord. The hCHT cDNA encodes a protein of 580 amino acids having 93% identity to rCHT1 and 51% identity to the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog CHO-1, and is distantly related to members of the Na(+)-coupled glucose transporter (SGLT) gene family of Na(+)-coupled glucose (SGLT), nucleoside and iodide transporters. Northern blot analysis reveals the expression of a approximately 5 kb transcript in human brain regions rich in cholinergic neurons including the putamen, spinal cord, and medulla. Expression of hCHT cDNA in COS-7 cells results in saturable, Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent choline uptake (K(m) = 1.2 microM) in membrane vesicles and HC-3 binding (K(d) = 4 nM) in membrane fractions, consistent with characteristics reported in mammalian cholinergic neurons. Using radiation hybrid mapping techniques, we localized the hCHT gene to human chromosome 2q12. These studies elucidate the primary structure and chromosomal localization of hCHT and provide a basis for mechanistic analysis of HACU regulation and an investigation of the role of hCHT in disease states.

Understanding the molecular basis of fragile X syndrome.
Uniparental disomy has recently been recognized to cause human disorders, including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We describe a particularly instructive case which raises important issues concerning the mechanisms producing uniparental disomy and whose evaluation provides evidence that trisomy may precede uniparental disomy in a fetus. Chorionic villus sampling performed for advanced maternal age revealed trisomy 15 in all direct and cultured cells, though the fetus appeared normal. Chromosome analysis of amniocytes obtained at 15 wk was normal in over 100 cells studied. The child was hypotonic at birth, and high-resolution banding failed to reveal the deletion of 15q11-13, a deletion which is found in 50% -70% of patients with PWS. Over time, typical features of PWS developed. Molecular genetic analysis using probes for chromosome 15 revealed maternal disomy. Maternal nondisjunction with fertilization of a disomic egg by a normal sperm, followed by loss of the paternal 15, is a likely cause of confined placental mosaicism and uniparental disomy in this case of PWS, and advanced maternal age may be a predisposing factor..
Unusual complications of antithyroid drug therapy: four case reports and review of literature.
Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) is a progressive myoclonus epilepsy common in Finland and North Africa, and less common in Western Europe. ULD is mostly caused by expansion of a dodecamer repeat in the cystatin B gene ( CSTB) promoter. We performed a haplotype study of ULD chromosomes (ULDc) with the repeat expansion. We included 48 West European Caucasian (WEC) and 47 North African (NA) ULDc. We analysed eight markers flanking CSTB(GT10-D21S1890-D21S1885-D21S2040-D21S1259- CSTB-D21S1912-PFKL-D21S171) and one intragenic variant in the CSTB 3' UTR (A2575G). We observed a founder effect in most of the NA ULD patients, as 61.7% of the NA ULDc (29/47) shared the same haplotype, A1 (1-1-A-1-6-7), for markers D21S1885-D21S2040-A2575G-D21S1259-D21S1912-PFKL. Moreover, if we considered only the markers D21S1885, D21S2040, A2575G and D21S1259, 43 of the 47 NA ULDc shared the same alleles 1-1-A-1, haplotype A. As previously shown, the WEC ULDc were heterogeneous. However, the Baltic haplotype, A3 (5-1-1-A-1-1), was observed in ten WEC ULDc (20.8%) and the CSTB 3'UTR variant, which we called the Alps variant, was observed in 17 ULDc (35.4%). Finally, as almost all NA patients, like Scandinavian patients, were of the haplotype A, we assumed that there was an ancient common founder effect in NA and Baltic ULD patients. We estimated that the putative most recent common ancestral ULD carrier with this haplotype A must have existed about 2,500 years ago (100-150 generations). Finally, this work provides evidence for the existence of only a small number of founder mutations in ULD.

Uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose) has a well established biochemical role as a glycosyl donor in the enzymatic biosynthesis of carbohydrates. It is less well known that UDP-glucose may possess pharmacological activity, suggesting that a receptor for this molecule may exist. Here, we show that UDP-glucose, and some closely related molecules, potently activate the orphan G protein-coupled receptor KIAA0001 heterologously expressed in yeast or mammalian cells. Nucleotides known to activate P2Y receptors were inactive, indicating the distinctly novel pharmacology of this receptor. The receptor is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues, including many regions of the brain. These data suggest that some sugar-nucleotides may serve important physiological roles as extracellular signaling molecules in addition to their familiar role in intermediary metabolism.

Urocortin, a new member of the CRF peptide family which also includes urotensin I and sauvagine, was recently cloned from the rat midbrain. The synthetic replicate of urocortin was found to bind with high affinity to type 1 and type 2 CRF receptors and, based upon its anatomic localization within the brain, was proposed to be a natural ligand for the type 2 CRF receptors. Using a genomic library, we have cloned the human counterpart of rat urocortin and localized it to human chromosome 2. Human and rat urocortin share 95% identity within the mature peptide region. Synthetic human urocortin binds with high affinity to CRF receptor types 1, 2 alpha, and 2 beta, stimulates cAMP accumulation from cells stably transfected with these receptors, and acts in vitro to release ACTH from dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells. In addition, the CRF-binding protein binds human urocortin with high affinity and can prevent urocortin-stimulated ACTH secretion in vitro. The inhibitory effect of the CRF-binding protein on human urocortin can be blocked by biologically inactive CRF fragments, such as CRF(9-33).
Uroplakin II gene is expressed in transitional cell carcinoma but not in bilharzial bladder squamous cell carcinoma: alternative pathways of bladder epithelial differentiation and tumor formation.
Uroplakins (UPs) are integral membrane proteins that are synthesized as the major differentiation products of mammalian urothelium. We have cloned the human UP-II gene and localized it on chromosome 11q23. A survey of 50 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) revealed a UP-II polymorphism but no tumor-specific mutations. Immunohistochemical staining using rabbit antisera against a synthetic peptide of UP-II and against total UPs showed UP reactivity in 39.5% (17 of 43 cases) of conventional TCCs, 12.8% (5 of 39) of bilharzial-related TCCs, and 2.7% (1 of 36) of bilharzial-related squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The finding that fewer bilharzial TCCs express UPs than conventional TCCs (12.8 versus 40%) raised the possibility that the former are heterogeneous, expressing SCC features to varying degrees. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that urothelium can undergo at least three pathways of differentiation: (a) urothelium-type pathway; (b) epidermis-type pathway; and (c) glandular-type pathway, characterized by the production of UPs, K1/K10 keratins, and secreted glycoproteins, respectively. Vitamin A deficiency and mesenchymal factors may play a role in determining the relative contributions of these pathways to urothelial differentiation as well as to the formation of TCC, SCC, and adenocarcinoma, or a mixture thereof.
Urotensin-II (U-II) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of U-II causes hypertension and bradycardia and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion. However, the behavioral effects of centrally administered U-II have received little attention. In the present study, we tested the effects of i.c.v. injections of U-II on behavioral, metabolic, and endocrine responses in mice. Administration of graded doses of U-II (1-10,000 ng/mouse) provoked: (1) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole-board test; (2) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black-and-white compartment test, and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus-maze test; and (3) a dose-dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced-swimming test and tail suspension test. Intracerebroventricular injection of U-II also caused an increase in: food intake at doses of 100 and 1,000 ng/mouse, water intake at doses of 100-10,000 ng/mouse, and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10,000 ng/mouse. Whatever was the dose, the central administration of U-II had no effect on body temperature, nociception, apomorphine-induced penile erection and climbing behavior, and stress-induced plasma corticosterone level. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the central injection of U-II at doses of 1-10,000 ng/mouse induces anxiogenic- and depressant-like effects in mouse. These data suggest that U-II may be involved in some aspects of psychiatric disorders.

Using a candidate gene approach, we identified a novel human gene, OTOF, underlying an autosomal recessive, nonsyndromic prelingual deafness, DFNB9. The same nonsense mutation was detected in four unrelated affected families of Lebanese origin. OTOF is the second member of a mammalian gene family related to Caenorhabditis elegans fer-1. It encodes a predicted cytosolic protein (of 1,230 aa) with three C2 domains and a single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain. The sequence homologies and predicted structure of otoferlin, the protein encoded by OTOF, suggest its involvement in vesicle membrane fusion. In the inner ear, the expression of the orthologous mouse gene, mainly in the sensory hair cells, indicates that such a role could apply to synaptic vesicles.
Using a model system of young, senescent and SV40-immortalized WI-38 fibroblasts, we identified two mRNAs upregulated in immortalized cells (imup-1, immortalization-upregulated protein 1, and imup-2). Compared to normal tissues, both genes were more frequently expressed in cancer cells. The open reading frame of imup-1 spans 321bp, coding for a 10.9 kDa protein of 106 amino acids, while an insertion of 59bp in the otherwise identical mRNA of imup-2 leads to a frameshift, resulting in an 8.5 kDa protein of 85 amino acids. Database searches identified these genes on chromosome 19, which could account for the cloned imup-1 and imup-2 transcripts by alternative splicing. Southern blot analysis of digested genomic DNA confirmed that both transcripts are derived from a single locus. The expressed proteins IMUP-1 and IMUP-2 share 46 identical N-terminal amino acids, whereas the C-termini are unrelated. Green fluorescent protein-fusions of both IMUP-1 and IMUP-2 accumulated in the nucleus of HeLa cells. The C-terminus of IMUP-1 contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, the deletion of which impaired nuclear translocation. In-vitro translated proteins bound to poly(rG), but did not interact with single-stranded DNA or double-stranded DNA. The nuclear localization of IMUP-1 and IMUP-2 as well as the upregulation of both underlying mRNAs in immortalized cells suggest a function in immortalization.
Using a polymerase chain reaction based differential screening approach, we have isolated and characterised a cDNA from a human metastatic breast tumour representing a novel protein tyrosine kinase (brk). Sequencing of brk cDNAs isolated from T-47D and MCF-7 human breast tumour cell lines indicate that they encode a protein with the features of a novel nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, including amino terminal SH3 and SH2 domains. When synthesised in recombinant baculovirus and bacterial expression systems, brk protein products are capable of autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Initial expression studies have detected low levels of brk transcripts in some human breast tumours and breast tumour cell lines, but not in normal breast tissue.
Using a positron emission tomography (PET) study it was shown recently that in migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state, but not in the headache free interval. It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called 'migraine generator'. To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients. A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Increases of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum. Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state. The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such, rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache.
Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated a novel human centrosomal protein, CPAP (centrosomal P4.1-associated protein), which specifically interacts with the head domain of the 135-kDa protein 4.1R isoform (4.1R-135). Sequence analysis revealed that the carboxyl terminus of CPAP has 31.3% amino acid identity with human Tcp-10 (a t-complex responder gene product). Interestingly, most of the sequence identity is restricted to two conserved regions. One carries a leucine zipper, which may form a series of heptad repeats involved in coiled-coil formation; the other contains unusual glycine repeats with unknown function. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that CPAP and gamma-tubulin are localized within the centrosome throughout the cell cycle. CPAP cosediments with gamma-tubulin in sucrose gradients and coimmunoprecipitates with gamma-tubulin, indicating that CPAP is a part of the gamma-tubulin complex. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that CPAP is localized within the center of microtubule asters and may participate in microtubule nucleation. The formation of microtubule asters was significantly inhibited by anti-CPAP antibody. Together, these observations indicate that CPAP may play an important role in cell division and centrosome function.
Using an expression cloning strategy, we isolated a cDNA encoding a human protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. Bacteria expressing the kinase domain of the keratinocyte growth factor receptor (bek/fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) were infected with a fibroblast cDNA library in a phagemid prokaryotic expression vector and screened with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Among several clones showing decreased anti-phosphotyrosine recognition, one displayed phosphatase activity toward the kinase in vitro. The 4.1-kilobase cDNA encoded a deduced protein of 185 amino acids with limited sequence similarity to the vaccinia virus phosphatase VH1. The purified recombinant protein dephosphorylated several activated growth factor receptors, as well as serine-phosphorylated casein, in vitro. Both serine and tyrosine phosphatase activities were completely abolished by mutagenesis of a single cysteine residue conserved in VH1 and the VH1-related (VHR) human protein. These properties suggest that VHR is capable of regulating intracellular events mediated by both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation.
Using mRNA from cultured human mesothelial cells, we constructed bacterial plasmids and lambda phage vectors that contained cDNA sequences specific for the keratins expressed in these cells. A cloned cDNA encoding keratin K7 (55 kD) was identified by positive hybrid selection. Southern Blot analysis indicated that this sequence is represented only once in the human genome, and Northern Blot analysis demonstrated that the gene encoding K7 is expressed in abundance in cultured bronchial and mesothelial cells, but only weakly in cultured epidermal cells and not at all in liver, colon, or exocervical tissue. The predicted amino acid sequence of this keratin has revealed a striking difference between this keratin and the type II keratins expressed in epidermal cells: whereas all of the epidermal type II keratins thus far sequenced have long nonhelical termini rich in glycine and serine, this mesothelial type II keratin has amino and carboxy terminal regions that are unusually short and lack the inexact repeats of glycine and serine residues.
Using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, we characterized the methylation pattern on the 5 side of the CTG repeat in the DMPK gene of normal individuals and of patients affected with myotonic dystrophy, showing expansions of the repetitive sequence. The gene segment analyzed corresponds to the genomic SacI-HindIII fragment carrying exons 11-15. There is constitutive methylation in intron 12 at restriction sites of SacII and HhaI, localized 1, 159-1, 232 bp upstream of the CTG repeat, whereas most, if not all, of the other sites of SacII, HhaI, and HpaII in this region are unmethylated, in normal individuals and most of the patients. In a number of young and severely affected patients, however, complete methylation of these restriction sites was found in the mutated allele. In most of these patients, the onset of the disease was congenital. Preliminary in vivo footprinting data gave evidence for protein-DNA contact in normal genes at an Sp1 consensus binding site upstream of the CTG repeat and for a significant reduction of this interaction in cells with a hypermethylated DMPK gene..
Using the arbitrarily primed-PCR (AP-PCR) assay to detect genetic abnormalities that occur in a panel of lymphoid cell lines, we identified an amplified stretch of genomic DNA that contained a putative open reading frame. Northern blot analysis with this genomic clone revealed widespread low level expression in normal human tissue. The full cDNA sequence was obtained with no significant homology to any known genes in the genome database. We termed this novel gene with multiple copies in a T-cell malignancy as MCT-1. MCT-1 was localized to the long arm of chromosome Xq22-24 by flourescence in situ hybridization analysis. Although there was no significant homology at the primary sequence level, there was a limited degree of amino acid homology with a domain of cyclin H that appears to specify protein-protein complexes. This relationship between MCT-1 and cyclin H implied a potential role for MCT-1 in cell cycle regulation. Overexpression of MCT-1 increased the proliferative rate of cells by decreasing the length of the G1 phase without a reciprocal increase in the S and G2-M phases. Recent work has established the role of cell cycle regulatory molecules in the development of certain human malignancies. Therefore, we investigated the transforming ability of MCT-1 overexpression using soft agar growth assays and demonstrated that only MCT-1-overexpressing cells were able to establish colonies. Taken together, MCT-1 is a novel candidate oncogene with homology to a protein-protein binding domain of cyclin H.
Using two-stage coronary ligation-, digitalis-, and adrenaline-induced canine ventricular arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic effects of cibenzoline were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each arrhythmia model was determined. Cibenzoline suppressed all the arrhythmias, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by 24-h coronary ligation, 48-h coronary ligation, digitalis, and adrenaline were 1.9 +/- 0.9 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 1.6 +/- 0.5 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 0.6 +/- 0.2 (by 2 mg/kg i.v.), and 3.5 +/- 1.3 (by 5 mg/kg i.v.) micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SDM, n = 6-7). The concentration for adrenaline-induced arrhythmia was significantly higher than those for the other types of arrhythmias. This pharmacological profile is similar to those of mexiletine and tocainide, and all three drugs have central nervous system (CNS) stimulant action. Because cibenzoline had only weak hypotensive and sinus node depressive effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation arrhythmia dogs, its clinical usefulness is expected.
Utility of troponin I in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain.
Utilization of purines by an HPRT variant in an intelligent, nonmutilative patient with features of the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.
Utilizing the CEPH reference panel and genotypic data for 53 markers, we have constructed a 20-locus multipoint genetic map of human chromosome 4. New RFLPs are reported for four loci. The map integrates a high-resolution genetic map of 4p16 into a continuous map extending to 4q31 and an unlinked cluster of three loci at 4q35. The 20 linked markers form a continuous linkage group of 152 cM in males and 202 cM in females. Likely genetic locations are provided for 25 polymorphic anonymous sequences and 28 gene-specific RFLPs. The map was constructed employing the LINKAGE and CRIMAP computational methodologies to build the multipoint map via a stepwise algorithm. A detailed 10-point map of the 4p16 region constructed from the CEPH panel provides evidence for heterogeneity in the linkage maps constructed from families segregating for Huntington disease (HD). It additionally provides evidence for position-specific recombination frequencies in the telomeric region of 4p..

Valproate-induced chorea and encephalopathy in atypical nonketotic hyperglycinemia.
Valproate-induced encephalopathy is a rare syndrome that may manifest in otherwise normal epileptic individuals. It may even present in patients who have tolerated this medicine well in the past. It is usually but not necessarily associated with hyperammonemia. The EEG shows characteristic triphasic waves in most patients with this complication. A case of valproate-induced encephalopathy is presented. The problems in diagnosing this condition are subsequently discussed.
Valproate-induced encephalopathy.
Valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy in a renal transplanted patient.
Valproic acid (VPA) is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug and is usually well-tolerated. Rare serious complications may occur in some patients, including haemorrhagic pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression, VPA-induced hepatotoxicity and VPA-induced encephalopathy. The typical signs of VPA-induced encephalopathy are impaired consciousness, sometimes marked EEG background slowing, increased seizure frequency, with or without hyperammonemia. There is still no proof of causative effect of VPA in patients with encephalopathy, but only of an association with an assumed causal relation. We report 19 patients with VPA-associated encephalopathy in Germany from the years 1994 to 2003, none of whom had been published previously.
Valproic acid (VPA) is effective for the treatment of many types of epilepsy, but its use can be associated with an increase in body weight. We report a case of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) arising in a child who developed obesity during VPA treatment. Laboratory data revealed hyperinsulinemia with insulin resistance. After the withdrawal of VPA therapy, our patient showed a significant weight loss, a decrease of body mass index, and normalization of metabolic and endocrine parameters; moreover, ultrasound measurements showed a complete normalization. The present case suggests that obesity, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and long-term treatment with VPA may be all associated with the development of NAFLD; this side effect is reversible after VPA withdrawal.
Valproic acid (VPA) was given to 24 epileptic patients who were already being treated with other antiepileptic drugs. A standardized loading dose of VPA was administered, and venous blood was sampled at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. Ammonia (NH3) was higher in patients who, during continuous therapy, complained of drowsiness (7 patients) than in those who were symptom-free (17 patients), although VPA plasma levels were similar in both groups. By measuring VPA-induced changes of blood NH3 content, it may be possible to identify patients at higher risk of obtundation when VPA is given chronically.

Valvular heart abnormalities have been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with pergolide. However, the incidence and severity of these abnormalities vary from study to study and their course after drug withdrawal has not been systematically assessed. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency and severity of valvular heart abnormality and its possible reversibility after drug withdrawal in a case-control study. METHODS: All PD patients in the Amiens area treated with pergolide were invited to attend a cardiologic assessment including transthoracic echocardiography. Thirty PD patients participated in the study. A second echocardiography was performed (median interval: 13 months) after pergolide withdrawal (n=10 patients). Controls were age- and sex-matched non-PD patients referred to the cardiology department. RESULTS: Compared to controls, aortic regurgitation (OR: 3.1; 95% IC: 1.1-8.8) and mitral regurgitation (OR: 10.7; 95% IC: 2.1-53) were more frequent in PD patients (tricuspid: NS). The number of affected valves (n=2.4+/-0.7) and the sum of regurgitation grades (n=2.8+/-1.09) were higher (p=0.008 and p=0.006, respectively) in the pergolide group. Severity of regurgitation was not correlated with pergolide cumulative dose. A restrictive pattern of valvular regurgitation, suggestive of the role of pergolide, was observed in 12/30 (40%) patients including two with heart failure. Pergolide was discontinued in 10 patients with valvular heart disease, resulting in a lower regurgitation grade (p=0.01) at the second transthoracic echocardiography and the two patients with heart failure returned to nearly normal clinical examination. This study supports the high frequency of restrictive valve regurgitation in PD patients treated with pergolide and reveals that a significant improvement is usual when the treatment is converted to non-ergot dopamine agonists.

Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal dominant craniofacial disorder with high penetrance and variable expression. Its clinical features are variably expressed, but include cleft lip and/or cleft palate, lip pits and hypodontia. All VWS families studied to date map the disease gene to a < 2 cM region of chromosome 1q32, with no evidence of locus heterogeneity. The aim of this study is to refine the localization of the VWS gene and to further assess possible heterogeneity. We analyzed four multiplex VWS families. All available members were clinically assessed and genotyped for 19 short tandem repeat markers on chromosome 1 in the VWS candidate gene region. We performed two-point and multipoint limit of detection (LOD) score analyses using a high penetrance autosomal dominant model. All families showed positive LOD scores without any recombination in the candidate region. The largest two-point LOD score was 5. 87 87. Our assay method for short tandem repeat (STR) markers provided highly accurate size estimation of marker allele fragment sizes, and therefore enabled us to determine the specific alleles segregating with the VWS gene in each of our four families. We observed a striking pattern of STR allele sharing at several closely linked loci among our four Caucasian VWS families recruited at three different locations in the US. These results suggest the possibility of a unique origin for a mutation responsible for many or most cases of VWS.
Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal dominant disorder comprising cleft lip and/or cleft palate and lip pits. We reported previously a family whose underlying mutation is a 500-800 kb deletion localized to chromosome bands 1q32-q41 [Sander et al., 1994 Hum Mol Genet 3 576-578]. Along with cleft lip/palate and lip pits, affected relatives exhibit developmental delays, suggesting that the function of a gene nearby may also be disrupted. To further localize the VWS gene we searched for other deletions that cause VWS. An allele loss assay was performed using a novel highly polymorphic marker, D1S3753. From a panel of 37 unrelated individuals, we detected an allele loss in one family, indicating the presence of a deletion. In this family, the phenotype in three generations of affected individuals was confined to the cardinal signs of VWS. Surprisingly, mapping of the new deletion showed that it extended 0. 2-1 Mb beyond the proximal breakpoint for the deletion described previously. No deletions were detected in seven cases of popliteal pterygia syndrome, 76 cases of mixed syndromic forms of cleft lip and palate, and 178 cases of nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate.
Variable Charge X/Y (VCX/Y) is a human testis-specific gene family that localized on X and Y chromosomes. In this study, VCY protein was expressed in E. coli in the form of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. With the purified fusion protein as antigen, the anti-GST-VCY antibody was generated and the localization of VCY protein in human testis was determined by immunohistochemistry. In the testis seminiferous epithelium, VCY proteins were highly expressed in nuclei of germ cells. Using propidium iodide staining and green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag technologies, VCY and VCX-8r proteins were mainly localized in the nucleoli of COS7 cells. In addition, the colocalization for VCY and VCX-8r in COS7 cells was also observed. With VCY cDNA as bait, a cDNA fragment of acidic ribosomal protein PO was obtained using yeast two-hybrid system. All the information above indicates that VCX/Y protein family might be involved in the regulation of ribosome assembly during spermatogenesis.
Variant splicing of gonadotropin receptor mRNA commonly occurs, however expression of receptor protein variants and their trafficking has yet to be studied in detail. To determine receptor variant trafficking and intracellular processing in mammalian cells, the intracellular fate of intentionally truncated variants of human follicle stimulating hormone receptor (hFSH-R) expressed in CHO cells was examined. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were made against the hFSH-R's extracellular domain (ECD) expressed in insect cells. Four mAbs 106.156, 106.290, 106.318, and 106.263 were chosen as probes. Epitope mapping using synthetic peptides, and truncated hFSH-R variants revealed that mAb 106.156 bound to ECD residues 183-220, while mAbs 106.318, 106.290, 106.263 bound ECD residues 300-331. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that mAbs 106.318 and 106.156 stained the surface of fixed, intact CHO cells expressing wild type hFSH-R. However, following cell permeabilization all four antibodies stained hFSH-R in Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. Permeabilized cells expressing truncated variants ECD213 and ECD254 showed staining accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope continuum. ECD335/His was found to accumulate in extended endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER location of ECD335/His was confirmed by double labeling experiments with concanavalin A and ECD mAb. Glycosidase digestion followed by Western blot analysis show ECD213 and ECD335/His to be glycosylated, but not ECD254. Both glycosylated truncated hFSH-R variants were sensitive to peptide-N-glycanase F and endoglycosidase H but insensitive to neuraminidase indicating that these variants possess high mannose type oligosaccharides. Thus truncated hFSH-R variants do not reach the medial or trans Golgi where high mannose oligosaccharides are trimmed and sialic acid is added. These data suggest that the conformation the ECD of the wild type receptor is different from the ECD alone expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. This information suggests that the ECD serves two distinct roles; the first is to bind FSH and the other is likely to contact the endodomain of the receptor, which presumably leads to activation of the endodomain for signal transduction.

Various data suggest that male patients who have received digoxin on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum estrogen and decreased levels of plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH). This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long-term administration of digoxin therapy and sexual behavior, and the effect of digoxin on plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, and LH. The patients of the study and control group (without digoxin) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age (25-40 years) and were randomly selected from the rheumatic heart disease patients. A subjective assessment of sexual behavior in the study and control groups was carried out, using parameters such as sexual desire, sexual excitement, and frequency of sexual relations. Personal interviews and a questionnaire were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavior. The findings support the reports concerning digoxin effect on plasma estradiol, testosterone, and LH. The differences in the means were significant. Tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant decrease in sexual desire, sexual excitement phase (erection), and frequency of sexual relations in the study group.

Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is a systemic and coronary vasodilator that may have positive inotropic properties. Myocardial levels of VIP were assayed before and after the development of heart failure in two canine models. In the first, cobalt cardiomyopathy was induced in eight dogs; VIP (by radioimmunoassay) decreased from 35 +/- 11 pg/mg protein (mean +/- SD) to 5 +/- 4 pg/mg protein (P less than 0.05). In six dogs with doxorubicin-induced heart failure, VIP decreased from 31 +/- 7 to 11 +/- 4 pg/mg protein (P less than 0.05). In addition, VIP content of left ventricular muscle of resected failing hearts in 10 patients receiving a heart transplant was compared with the papillary muscles in 14 patients (five with rheumatic disease, nine with myxomatous degeneration) receiving mitral valve prostheses. The lowest myocardial VIP concentration was found in the hearts of patients with coronary disease (one patient receiving a transplant and three receiving mitral prostheses) (6.3 +/- 1.9 pg/mg protein). The other patients undergoing transplantation had an average ejection fraction of 17% +/- 6% and a VIP level of 8.8 +/- 3.9 pg/mg protein. The hearts without coronary artery disease (average ejection fraction of this group 62% +/- 10%) had a VIP concentration of 14.1 +/- 7.9 pg/mg protein, and this was greater than in hearts of the patients with coronary disease and the hearts of patients receiving a transplant (P less than 0.05). Myocardial catecholamines were also determined in 14 subjects; a weak correlation (r = 0.57, P less than 0.05) between the tissue concentrations of VIP and norepinephrine was noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in micturition pathways. VIP(-/-) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis. Given VIP's role as an anti-inflammatory mediator, we hypothesized that VIP(-/-) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after cystitis. A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type (WT) and VIP(-/-) mice with or without CYP-induced cystitis (150 mg/kg; i.p.; 48 h). Four binary comparisons were made: WT control versus CYP treatment (48 h), VIP(-/-) control versus CYP treatment (48 h), WT control versus VIP(-/-) control, and WT with CYP treatment (48 h) versus VIP(-/-) with CYP treatment (48 h). The genes presented represent (1) greater than 1.5-fold change in either direction and (2) the p value is less than 0.05 for the comparison being made. Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme-linked immunoassays including IL-1beta and CXCL1. CYP treatment significantly (p < or = 0.001) increased expression of CXCL1 and IL-1beta in the urinary bladder of WT and VIP(-/-) mice, but expression in VIP(-/-) mice with CYP treatment was significantly (p < or = 0.001) greater (4.2- to 13-fold increase) than that observed in WT urinary bladder (3.6- to 5-fold increase). The data suggest that in VIP(-/-) mice with bladder inflammation, inflammatory mediators are increased above that observed in WT with CYP. This shift in balance may contribute to increased bladder dysfunction in VIP(-/-) mice with bladder inflammation and altered neurochemical expression in micturition pathways.

Ventricular fibrillation causes more than 300, 000 sudden deaths each year in the USA alone. In approximately 5-12% of these cases, there are no demonstrable cardiac or non-cardiac causes to account for the episode, which is therefore classified as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). A distinct group of IVF patients has been found to present with a characteristic electrocardiographic pattern. Because of the small size of most pedigrees and the high incidence of sudden death, however, molecular genetic studies of IVF have not yet been done. Because IVF causes cardiac rhythm disturbance, we investigated whether malfunction of ion channels could cause the disorder by studying mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A. We have now identified a missense mutation, a splice-donor mutation, and a frameshift mutation in the coding region of SCN5A in three IVF families. We show that sodium channels with the missense mutation recover from inactivation more rapidly than normal and that the frameshift mutation causes the sodium channel to be non-functional. Our results indicate that mutations in cardiac ion-channel genes contribute to the risk of developing IVF..

Verapamil is an effective and relatively-safe antihypertensive drug. Serious adverse effects are uncommon and mainly have been related to the depression of cardiac contractility and conduction, especially when the drug is combined with beta-blocking agents. We report a case in which myocardial infarction coincided with the introduction of captopril and the withdrawal of verapamil in a previously asymptomatic woman with severe hypertension. Possible mechanisms that involve a verapamil-related increase in platelet and/or vascular alpha 2-adrenoreceptor affinity for catecholamines are discussed.

Vertebrate genes with sequence similarity to the Drosophila homeobox gene, sine oculis (so), constitute the SIX family. There is notable expression of members of this family in anterior neural structures, and several SIX genes have been shown to play roles in vertebrate and insect development, or have been implicated in maintenance of the differentiated state of tissues. Mutations in three of these genes in man (SIX5, SIX6 and SIX3) are associated with severe phenotypes, and therefore, the cloning of other human genes from this family is of interest. We have cloned and characterised the gene that encodes human SIX2, elucidated its gene structure and conducted expression studies in a range of tissues. SIX2 is widely expressed in the late first-trimester fetus, but has a limited range of expression sites in the adult. The expression pattern of SIX2 and its localisation to chromosome 2p15-p16 will be of use in assessing its candidacy in human developmental disorders.
Very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency is a life-threatening disorder of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. We identified four novel mutations in three unrelated patients. All patients had the severe childhood form of VLCAD deficiency with early onset and high mortality. Immunoblot analysis revealed that VLCAD protein was undetectable in patients 2 and 3, whereas normal-size VLCAD protein and an aberrant form of VLCAD (4kDa smaller) were detected in patient 1. As expected, null mutations were found in patients 2 and 3 patient 2 is homozygous for a frameshift mutation, del 4 bp at 798-801, and patient 3 is homozygous for a nonsense mutation 65C > A (S22X). Patient 1 was homozygous for a complex mutant allele containing two alterations, including a 194C > T transition (P65L) and 739A > C transversion (K247Q); in the case of P65L, the amino acid change does not reduce enzyme activity. However, the nucleotide change resulted in exon 3 skipping, whereas the latter K247Q mutation had a drastic effect on enzyme activity. We verified these events by in vivo splicing experiments and transient expression analysis of mutant cDNAs. The P65L mutation locates 11 bases upstream of a splice donor site of intron 3. This is an example of an exonic mutation which affects exon-splicing..
Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) is one of four straight-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACD) enzymes, which are all nuclear encoded mitochondrial flavoproteins catalyzing the initial step in fatty acid beta-oxidation. We have used the very fast, Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) based strategy to obtain the sequence of cDNAs encoding human VLCAD from placenta and fibroblasts. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of human VLCAD with those of the other human ACD enzymes revealed extensive sequence homology. Moreover, human VLCAD and human acyl-CoA oxidase showed extensive sequence homology corroborating the notion that these genes are evolutionarily related. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from hybrid cell lines was used to localize the VLCAD gene to human chromosome 17p11. 2-p11. 13105. Using Northern and Western blot analysis to investigate the tissue specific distribution of VLCAD mRNA and protein in several human tissues we showed that VLCAD is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle. This agrees well with the fact that cardiac and muscle symptoms are characteristic for patients with VLCAD deficiency. Northern blot analysis and sequencing of cloned PCR amplified VLCAD cDNA from four unrelated patients with VLCAD deficiency showed that VLCAD mRNA was undetectable in one patient and that the other three have mutations in both VLCAD alleles. Western blot analysis of patient fibroblasts showed that the identified mutations result in severely reduced amounts of VLCAD protein.
Very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency is a disorder of fatty acid beta oxidation that reportedly has high rates of morbidity and mortality. We describe the outcome of a 5-year-old girl with VLCAD deficiency who was first seen at 5 months of age with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, encephalopathy, and hypotonia. Biochemical studies indicated VLCAD deficiency caused by a stable yet inactive enzyme. Molecular genetic analysis of her VLCAD gene revealed a T1372C (F458L) missense mutation and a 1668 ACAG 1669 splice site mutation. After initial treatment with intravenous glucose and carnitine, the patient has thrived on a low-fat diet supplemented with medium-chain triglyceride oil and carnitine and avoidance of fasting. Her ventricular hypertrophy resolved significantly over 1 year, and cognitively, she is in the superior range for age. Clinical recognition of VLCAD deficiency is important because it is one of the few directly treatable causes of cardiomyopathy in children..

Visual and auditory neurotoxicity was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion-dependent anemia who were receiving iron chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous deferoxamine. Twenty-two patients in the affected group had abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4,000 to 8,000 Hz and in the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 decibels. When deferoxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed, audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks, and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic. Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent disability. Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg/kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg/kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality, and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated. Auditory deterioration and improvement, demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine, respectively, provided convincing evidence for a cause-and-effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity. Based on these data, a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine. A dose of 50 mg/kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities. With mild toxicity, a reduction to 30 or 40 mg/kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks. Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg/kg per dose with careful monitoring. In those with symptoms of hearing loss, the drug should be stopped for four weeks, and when the audiogram is stable or improved, therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg/kg per dose. Serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with auditory dysfunction.
Visual hallucinations are a rare event in chronic renal failure and not related to uremia per se. Unreported in the literature is visual hallucinations occurring in association with the new macrolide antibiotic, clarithromycin. We describe such a case in a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The combination of a relatively high dose of clarithromycin in face of chronic renal failure in a functionally anephric patient, with underlying aluminum intoxication, may have facilitated the appearance of this neurotoxic side effect. It is important to understand the pharmacokinetics of medications in face of chronic renal failure, the possibility of drug interactions, and how these factors should help guide medication therapy in the ESRD patient.

Voltage-gated K+ channels can form multimeric complexes with accessory beta-subunits. We report here a novel K+ channel beta-subunit cloned from human heart, hKv beta 1.3, that has 74-83% overall identity with previously cloned beta-subunits. Comparison of hKv beta 1.3 with the previously cloned hKv beta 3 and rKv beta 1 proteins indicates that the carboxyl-terminal 328 amino acids are identical, while unique variable length amino termini exist. Analysis of human beta-subunit cDNA and genomic nucleotide sequences confirm that these three beta-subunits are alternatively spliced from a common beta-subunit gene. Co-expression of hKv beta 1.3 in Xenopus oocytes with the delayed rectifier hKv1.5 indicated that hKv beta 1.3 has unique functional effects. This novel beta-subunit induced a time-dependent inactivation during membrane voltage steps to positive potentials, induced a 13-mV hyperpolarizing shift in the activation curve, and slowed deactivation (tau = 13 +/- 0.5 ms versus 35 +/- 1.7 ms at -40 mV). Most notably, hKv beta 1.3 converted the Kv1.5 outwardly rectifying current voltage relationship to one showing strong inward rectification. These data suggest that Kv channel current diversity may arise from association with alternatively spliced Kv beta-subunits. A simplified nomenclature for the K+ channel beta-subunit subfamilies is suggested.
Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary tumor syndrome characterized by predisposition for bilateral and multi-centric hemangioblastoma in the retina and central nervous system, pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, and cysts in the kidney, pancreas, and epididymis. We describe five families for which direct sequencing of the coding region of the VHL gene had failed to identify the family-specific mutation. Further molecular analysis revealed deletions involving the VHL gene in each of these families. In four families, partial deletions of one or more exons were detected by Southern blot analysis. In the fifth family, FISH analysis demonstrated the deletion of the entire VHL gene. Our results show that (quantitative) Southern blot analysis is a sensitive method for detecting germline deletions of the VHL gene and should be implemented in routine DNA diagnosis for VHL disease. Our data support the previously established observation that families with a germline deletion have a low risk for pheochromocytoma. Further unraveling of genotype-phenotype correlations in VHL disease has revealed that families with a full or partial deletion of the VHL gene exhibit a phenotype with a preponderance of central nervous system hemangioblastoma..
Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an autosomal dominant disorder with inherited susceptibility to various forms of cancer, including hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, phaeochromocytomas, pancreatic malignancies, and renal cell carcinomas. Renal cell carcinomas constitute a particularly frequent cause of death in this disorder, occurring as bilateral and multifocal tumours, and presenting at an earlier age than in sporadic, non-familial cases of this tumour type. We report here that the VHL gene is linked to the locus encoding the human homologoue of the RAF1 oncogene, which maps to chromosome 3p25 (ref. 4). Crossovers with the VHL locus suggest that the defect responsible for the VHL phenotype is not a mutation in the RAF1 gene itself. An alternative or prior event to oncogene activation in tumour formation may be the inactivation of a putative tumour suppressor which can be associated with both the inherited and sporadic forms of the cancer. Sporadic renal cell carcinomas have previously been associated with the loss of regions on chromosome 3p (refs 5, 6). Consequently, sporadic and VHL-associated forms of renal cell carcinoma might both result from alterations causing loss of function of the same tumour suppressor gene on this chromosome..

WNK (with no lysine ) protein kinases were named for their unique active site organization. Mutations in WNK1 and WNK4 cause a familial form of hypertension by undefined mechanisms. Here, we report that WNK1 selectively binds to and phosphorylates synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) within its calcium binding C2 domains. Endogenous WNK1 and Syt2 coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize on a subset of secretory granules in INS-1 cells. Phosphorylation by WNK1 increases the amount of Ca2+ required for Syt2 binding to phospholipid vesicles; mutation of threonine 202, a WNK1 phosphorylation site, partially prevents this change. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of Syts by WNK1 can regulate Ca2+ sensing and the subsequent Ca2+-dependent interactions mediated by Syt C2 domains. These findings provide a biochemical mechanism that could lead to the retention or insertion of proteins in the plasma membrane. Interruption of this regulatory pathway may disturb membrane events that regulate ion balance. Copyright 2004 Cell Press
WNK1 phosphorylates synaptotagmin 2 and modulates its membrane binding.
WNT signalling orchestrates a number of developmental programs. In response to this stimulus, cytoplasmic beta-catenin (encoded by CTNNB1) is stabilized, enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the LEF/TCF family. One of the target genes for beta-catenin/TCF encodes c-MYC, explaining why constitutive activation of the WNT pathway can lead to cancer, particularly in the colon. Most colon cancers arise from mutations in the gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a protein required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin, but a small percentage of colon and some other cancers harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Recently, we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta-catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas. Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis, we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Here, we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour. We found nuclear LEF-1 in the dividing tumour cells, providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells. At least 75% of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino-terminal segment, normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein. This percentage of CTNNB1 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far, and directly implicates beta-catenin/LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans..
Warfarin is the most widely used oral anticoagulant and is indicated for many clinical conditions. Levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in clinical practice and is effective against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and atypical bacteria. While small prospective studies have not revealed any significant drug-drug interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin, several case reports have indicated that levofloxacin may significantly potentiate the anticoagulation effect of warfarin. We report 3 cases of serious bleeding complications that appear to be the result of the interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin. Physicians should be aware of this potential interaction and use caution when prescribing levofloxacin to patients taking warfarin.
Warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (W-ICH) is a severe type of stroke. There is no consensus on the optimal treatment for W-ICH. Using a mouse model, we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volume. Male CD-1 mice were treated with warfarin (2 mg/kg over 24 h), resulting in a mean (+/-s.d.) International Normalized Ratio of 3.5+/-0.9. First, we showed that an intravenous administration of human PCC rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice. Second, a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce hemorrhage in the right striatum. Forty-five minutes later, the animals were randomly treated with PCC (100 U/kg) or saline i.v. (n=12 per group). Twenty-four hours after hemorrhage induction, hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay. The mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in PCC-treated animals (6.5+/-3.1 microL) compared with saline controls (15.3+/-11.2 microL, P=0.015). In the saline group, 45% of the mice developed large hematomas (i.e., >15 microL). In contrast, such extensive lesions were never found in the PCC group. We provide experimental data suggesting PCC to be an effective acute treatment for W-ICH in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume. Future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human W-ICH.

Water excretion by the kidney is regulated by the peptide hormone vasopressin. Vasopressin increases the water permeability of the renal collecting duct cells, allowing more water to be reabsorbed from collecting duct urine to blood. Despite long-standing interest in this process, the mechanism of the water permeability increase has remained undetermined. Recently, a molecular water channel (AQP-CD) has been cloned whose expression appears to be limited to the collecting duct. Previously, we immunolocalized this water channel to the apical plasma membrane (APM) and to intracellular vesicles (IVs) of collecting duct cells. Here, we test the hypothesis that vasopressin increases cellular water permeability by inducing exocytosis of AQP-CD-laden vesicles, transferring water channels from IVs to APM. Rat collecting ducts were perfused in vitro to determine water permeability and subcellular distribution of AQP-CD in the same tubules. The collecting ducts were fixed for immunoelectron microscopy before, during, and after exposure to vasopressin. Vasopressin exposure induced increases in water permeability and the absolute labeling density of AQP-CD in the APM. In parallel, the APM:IV labeling ratio increased. Furthermore, in response to vasopressin withdrawal, AQP-CD labeling density in the APM and the APM:IV labeling ratio decreased in parallel to a measured decrease in osmotic water permeability. We conclude that vasopressin increases the water permeability of collecting duct cells by inducing a reversible translocation of AQP-CD water channels from IVs to the APM.

We analysed 50 probands with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer for germline mutations in the coding region of the BRCA1 candidate gene, using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis on PCR-amplified genomic DNA. A total of eight putative disease-causing alterations were identified four of these are frameshifts and two are nonsense mutations. In addition, we found two missense mutations, one of which changes the final cysteine of the BRCA1 zinc finger motif to glycine. These data are consistent with a tumour suppressor model, and support the notion that this candidate gene is in fact BRCA1. The heterogeneity of mutations, coupled with the large size of the gene, indicates that clinical application of BRCA1 mutation testing will be technically challenging..
We are still a long way from discovering an unequivocal pathogenetic interpretation of progressive muscular dystrophy in man. Noteworthy efforts have been made in the experimental field; a recessive autosomic form found in the mouse seems to bear the closest resemblance to the human form from the genetic point of view. Myopathy due to lack of vitamin E and myopathy induced by certain viruses have much in common anatomically and pathologically with the human form. The authors induced myodystrophy in the rat by giving it a diet lacking in vitamin E. The pharmacological characteristics of vitamin E and the degenerative changes brought about by its deficiency, especially in the muscles, are illustrated. It is thus confirmed that the histological characteristics of myopathic rat muscle induced experimentally are extraordinarily similar to those of human myopathy as confirmed during biopsies performed at the Orthopaedic Traumatological Centre, Florence. The encouraging results obtained in various authoratative departments in myopathic patients by using anabolizing steroids have encouraged the authors to investigate the beneficial effects of one anabolizing agent (Dianabol, CIBA) at high doses in rats rendered myopathic by a diet deficient in vitamin E. In this way they obtained appreciable changes in body weight (increased from 50 to 70 g after forty days at a dose of 5 mg per day of anabolizing agent), but most of all they found histological changes due to "regenerative" changes in the muscle tissue, which however maintained its myopathic characteristics in the control animals that were not treated with the anabolizing agent. The authors conclude by affirming the undoubted efficacy of the anabolizing steroids in experimental myopathic disease, but they have reservations as to the transfer of the results into the human field, where high dosage cannot be carried out continuously because of the effects of the drug on virility; because the tissue injury too often occurs at an irreversible stage vis-a-vis the "regeneration" of the muscle tissue; and finally because the dystrophic injurious agent is certainly not the lack of vitamin E but something as yet unknown.
We assessed force coordination of the hand in Parkinson's disease and its relationship to motor complications of levodopa therapy, particularly to levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID). We studied two groups of Parkinson's disease patients with (Parkinson's disease + LID, n = 23) and without levodopa-induced dyskinesias (Parkinson's disease - LID, n = 10), and age-matched healthy controls. The motor score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, a dyskinesia score and force in a grip-lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF levodopa. A pathological increase of forces was seen in ON-state in Parkinson's disease + LID only. In Parkinson's disease + LID, the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by levodopa (by 61%, P < 0.05). An overshooting of peak grip force by 51% (P < 0.05) and of static grip force by 45% (P < 0.01) was observed in the ON- compared with the OFF-drug condition. In contrast, no excessive force was found in Parkinson's disease - LID. Peak grip force in ON-state was 140% (P < 0.05) higher in Parkinson's disease + LID than in Parkinson's disease - LID, while static grip force was increased by 138% (P < 0.01) between groups. Severity of peak-dose dyskinesias was strongly correlated with grip force in ON-state (r = 0.79 with peak force, P < 0.01). No correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication. Force excess was only observed in patients with LID and motor fluctuations. A close relationship was seen between the overshooting of forces and dyskinesias in the ON-drug condition. We postulate that both LID and grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanisms related to motor fluctuations.
We characterized the genomic structure of the human ING1 gene, a candidate tumor suppressor gene, and found that the gene has three exons. We also demonstrated that four mRNA variants were transcribed from three different promoter regions. Of 34 informative cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, 68% of tumors showed loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 13q33-34, where the ING1 gene is located. Here we present the first report that three missense mutations and three silent changes were detected in the ING1 gene in 6 of 23 tumors with allelic loss at the 13q33-34 region. These missense mutations were found within the PHD finger domain and nuclear localization motif in ING1 protein, probably abrogating the normal function.
We characterized two novel mutations of the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) gene in two Japanese patients with GALT deficiency and identified N314D and R333W mutations, previously found in Caucasians. One novel missense mutation was an G-to-A transition in exon 8, resulting in the substitution of arginine by histidine at the codon 231 (R231H). GALT activity of the R231H mutant construct was reduced to 15% of normal controls in a COS cell expression system. The other was a splicing mutation, an A-to-G transition at the 38th nucleotide in exon 3 (318A-- > G), resulting in a 38-bp deletion in the GALT cDNA by activating a cryptic splice acceptor site. In seven Japanese families (14 alleles for classic form and one allele for Duarte variant) with GALT deficiency, the R231H and 318A-- > G mutations were found only on both alleles of the proband. The N314D and R333W mutations were found on one allele each. The Q188R was prevalent in the United States but not in Japanese patients. The N314D mutation was associated with the Duarte variant in Japanese persons, as well as in the United States. We speculate that classic galactosemia mutations appear to differ between Japanese and Caucasian patients. Our limited data set on galactosemia mutations in Japanese suggests that the N314D GALT mutation encoding the Duarte variant arose before Asian and Caucasian people diverged and that classic galactosemia mutations arose and/or accumulated after the divergence of Asian and Caucasian populations..
We compared horizontal eye movements (visually guided saccades, antisaccades, and smooth pursuit) in control subjects (n = 14) and patients with three forms of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias type I spinocerebellar ataxias 1 and 2 (SCA1, n = 11; SCA2, n = 10) and SCA3/Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) (n = 16). In SCA1, saccade amplitude was significantly increased, resulting in hypermetria. The smooth pursuit gain was decreased. In SCA2, saccade velocity was markedly decreased. The percentage of errors in antisaccades was greatly increased and was significantly correlated with age at disease onset. In addition, a correlation between smooth pursuit gain and the number of trinucleotide repeats was found. In SCA3, gaze-evoked nystagmus was often present as was saccade hypometria and smooth pursuit gain was markedly decreased. Three major criteria, saccade amplitude, saccade velocity, and presence of gaze-evoked nystagmus, permitted the correct assignment of 90% of the SCA1, 90% of the SCA2, and 93% of the patients with SCA3 to their genetically confirmed patient group and, therefore, may help orient diagnoses of SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 at early clinical stages of the diseases..
We compared the effects of single doses of 50 mg atenolol (cardioselective), 40 mg propranolol (nonselective), and placebo on both exercise- and isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in two experiments involving nine normal subjects. Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced from 187 +/- 4(SEM) after placebo to 146 +/- 7 bpm after atenolol and 138 +/- 6 bpm after propranolol, but there were no differences between the drugs. The effects on isoproterenol tachycardia were determined before and after atropine (0.04 mg/kg IV). Isoproterenol sensitivity was determined as the intravenous dose that increased heart rate by 25 bpm (CD25) and this was increased from 1.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms after placebo to 38.9 +/- 8.3 micrograms after propranolol and 8.3 +/- 1.7 micrograms after atenolol. The difference in the effects of the two was significant. After atropine the CD25 was unchanged after placebo (2.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms) and atenolol (7.7 +/- 1.3 micrograms); it was reduced after propranolol (24.8 +/- 5.0 micrograms), but remained different from atenolol. This change with propranolol sensitivity was calculated as the apparent Ka, this was unchanged by atropine (11.7 +/- 2.1 and 10.1 +/- 2.5 ml/ng). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise-induced tachycardia results largely from beta 1-receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs, whereas isoproterenol activates both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2-component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug. While there appear to be beta 2-receptors in the human heart, their physiologic or pathologic roles remain to be defined.
We compared the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety profile of a new galenic formulation of propofol (AM149 1%), which does not contain soyabean oil, with a standard formulation of propofol (Disoprivan 1%). In a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study, 30 healthy volunteers received a single intravenous bolus injection of 2.5 mg.kg-1 propofol. Plasma propofol levels were measured for 48 h following drug administration and evaluated according to a three-compartment model. The pharmacodynamic parameters assessed included induction and emergence times, respiratory and cardiovascular effects, and pain on injection. Patients were monitored for side effects over 48 h. Owing to a high incidence of thrombophlebitis, the study was terminated prematurely and only the data of the two parallel treatment groups (15 patients in each group) were analysed. Plasma concentrations did not differ significantly between the two formulations. Anaesthesia induction and emergence times, respiratory and cardiovascular variables showed no significant differences between the two treatment groups. Pain on injection (80 vs. 20%, p < 0.01) and thrombophlebitis (93.3 vs. 6.6%, p < 0.001) occurred more frequently with AM149 than with Disoprivan. Although both formulations had similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles the new formulation is not suitable for clinical use due to the high incidence of thrombophlebitis produced.
We compared the potential beta-receptor blocker, B 24/76 i.e. 1-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-3[2-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanolamino]-prop an-2-ol, which is characterized by beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulating properties with propranolol. The studies were performed using an experimental model of isoproterenol-induced heart hypertrophy in rats. A correlation of the blood pressure was neither found in the development nor in the attempt to suppress the development of heart hypertrophy with the two beta-receptor blockers. Both beta-blockers influenced the development of hypertrophy to a different, but not reproducible extent. It was possible to suppress the increased ornithine decarboxylase activity with both beta-blockers in hypertrophied hearts, but there was no effect on the heart mass. Neither propranolol nor B 24/76 could stop the changes in the characteristic myosin isoenzyme pattern of the hypertrophied rat heart. Thus, the investigations did not provide any evidence that the beta-receptor blockers propranolol and B 24/76 have the potency to prevent isoproterenol from producing heart hypertrophy.
We compared the systemic toxicity of bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine in anesthetized rats. We also compared the ability to resuscitate rats after lethal doses of these local anesthetics. Bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, or ropivacaine was infused at a rate of 2 mg. kg(-1). min(-1) while electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and arterial pressure were continuously monitored. When asystole was recorded, drug infusion was stopped and a resuscitation sequence was begun. Epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg was administered at 1-min intervals while external cardiac compressions were applied. Resuscitation was considered successful when a systolic arterial pressure > or =100 mm Hg was achieved within 5 min. The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine that produced seizures were similar and were larger than those of bupivacaine. The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine that produced dysrhythmias and asystole were smaller than the corresponding doses of ropivacaine, but they were larger than those of bupivacaine. The number of successful resuscitations did not differ among groups. However, a smaller dose of epinephrine was required in the Ropivacaine group than in the other groups. We conclude that the systemic toxicity of levobupivacaine is intermediate between that of ropivacaine and bupivacaine when administered at the same rate and that ropivacaine-induced cardiac arrest appears to be more susceptible to treatment than that induced by bupivacaine or levobupivacaine.
We conducted a double-blind, randomized phase II study to evaluate the safety and activity of combination therapy with N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (SC-48334) (an alpha-glucosidase I inhibitor) and zidovudine versus zidovudine alone. Patients with 200 to 500 CD4 cells/mm3 who tolerated < or = 12 weeks of prior zidovudine therapy received SC-48334 (1000 mg every 8 h) and zidovudine (100 mg every 8 h) or zidovudine and placebo. Sixty patients received combination therapy and 58, zidovudine and placebo. Twenty-three patients (38%) and 15 (26%), in the combination and zidovudine groups, respectively, discontinued therapy (p = 0.15). The mean SC-48334 steady-state trough level (4.04 +/- 0.99 micrograms/ml) was below the in vitro inhibitory concentration for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The mean increase in CD4 cells at week 4 was 73.8 cells/mm3 and 52.4 cells/mm3 for the combination and zidovudine groups, respectively (p > 0.36). For patients with prior zidovudine therapy, the mean change in CD4 cells in the combination and zidovudine groups was 63.7 cells/mm3 and 4.9 cells/mm3 at week 8 and 6.8 cells/mm3 and -45.1 cells/mm3 at week 16, respectively. The number of patients with suppression of HIV p24 antigenemia in the combination and zidovudine groups was six (40%) and two (11%) at week 4 (p = 0.10) and five (45%) and two (14%) at week 24 (p = 0.08), respectively. Diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, and weight loss were common for combination recipients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
We conducted a population-based 45-day follow-up study of 232,390 people who were prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), 266,951 prescribed trimethoprim alone, and 196,397 prescribed cephalexin, to estimate the risk of serious liver, blood, skin, and renal disorders resulting in referral or hospitalization associated with these drugs. The results were based on information recorded on office computers by selected general practitioners in the United Kingdom, together with a review of clinical records. The risk of clinically important idiopathic liver disease was similar for persons prescribed TMP-SMZ (5.2/100,000) and those prescribed trimethoprim alone (3.8/100,000). The risk for those prescribed cephalexin was somewhat lower (2.0/100,000). Only five patients experienced blood disorders, one of whom was exposed to TMP-SMZ; of seven with erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, four were exposed to TMP-SMZ. The one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in a patient who took cephalexin. Finally, only five cases of acute parenchymal renal disease occurred, none likely to be caused by a study drug. We conclude that the risk of the serious diseases studied is small for the three agents, and compares reasonably with the risk for many other antibiotics.
We conducted a systematic review of the effects of dexmedetomidine on cardiac outcomes following non-cardiac surgery. We included prospective, randomised peri-operative studies of dexmedetomidine that reported mortality, cardiac morbidity or adverse drug events. A PubMed Central and EMBASE search was conducted up to July 2007. The reference lists of identified papers were examined for further trials. Of 425 studies identified, 20 were included in the meta-analysis (840 patients). Dexmedetomidine was associated with a trend towards improved cardiac outcomes; all-cause mortality (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01-7.13, p = 0.44), non-fatal myocardial infarction (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04-1.60, p = 0.14), and myocardial ischaemia (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.26-1.63, p = 0.36). Peri-operative hypotension (26%, OR 3.80, 95% CI 1.91-7.54, p = 0.0001) and bradycardia (17%, OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.98-9.95, p < 0.00001) were significantly increased. An anticholinergic did not reduce the incidence of bradycardia (p = 0.43). A randomised placebo-controlled trial of dexmedetomidine is warranted.
We describe 3 episodes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) in 2 solid organ recipients under FK506 (tacrolimus) therapy. In both cases, discontinuation of FK506 and treatment with plasma exchange, fresh frozen plasma replacement, corticosteroids, aspirin, and dipyridamole led to resolution of MAHA. In one patient, reintroduction of FK506 led to rapid recurrence of MAHA. FK506-associated MAHA is probably rare but physicians must be aware of this severe complication. In our experience and according to the literature, FK506 does not seem to cross-react with cyclosporin A (CyA), an immuno-suppressive drug already known to induce MAHA.
We describe a 25-year-old woman with pre-existing mitral valve prolapse who developed intractable ventricular fibrillation after consuming a "natural energy" guarana health drink containing a high concentration of caffeine. This case highlights the need for adequate labelling and regulation of such products.
We describe a 42-year-old woman who developed superior sagittal and left transverse sinus thrombosis associated with prolonged epsilon-aminocaproic acid therapy for menorrhagia. This antifibrinolytic agent has been used in women with menorrhagia to promote clotting and reduce blood loss. Although increased risk of thromboembolic disease has been reported during treatment with epsilon-aminocaproic acid, cerebral sinus thrombosis has not been previously described. Careful use of epsilon-aminocaproic acid therapy is recommended.
We describe a French Canadian hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) kindred which carries a novel truncating mutation in hMLH1. Interestingly, the I1307K APC polymorphism, associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, is also present in this family. The I1307K polymorphism has previously only been identified in individuals of self-reported Ashkenazi Jewish origins. In addition, in this family, there appears to be no relationship between the I1307K polymorphism and the presence or absence of cancer..
We describe a case of transient neurological deficit that occurred after unilateral spinal anaesthesia with 8 mg of 1% hyperbaric bupivacaine slowly injected through a 25-gauge pencil-point spinal needle. The surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful, but 3 days after surgery, the patient reported an area of hypoaesthesia over L3-L4 dermatomes of the leg which had been operated on (loss of pinprick sensation) without reduction in muscular strength. Sensation in this area returned to normal over the following 2 weeks. Prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow-up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect. However, we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution (if pencil-point needle and slow injection rate are employed), in order to minimize the risk of a localized high peak anaesthetic concentration, which might lead to a transient neurological deficit.
We describe a female patient with stable Parkinson's disease who has shown a marked worsening of her motor functions following therapy of menopause related symptoms with veralipride, as well as the improvement of her symptoms back to baseline after discontinuation of the drug. We emphasize the anti-dopaminergic effect of veralipride.
We describe a girl with an unusual form of subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) and a complex malformation syndrome. SBH had an irregular inner margin, organized in contiguous fascicles of migrating neurons, sometimes giving the appearance of many small contiguous gyri. The true cortex had decreased thickness and showed a simplified gyral pattern with decreased number of gyri, which were usually of increased width, and shallow sulci. The cerebellum was hypoplastic. Additional features included epicanthal folds, hypertelorism, small nose with hypoplastic nares, bilateral syndactyly of the toes, pulmonary valve stenosis, atrial and ventricular septal defects. At the age of 1 year the patient had severe developmental delay and epilepsy. Chromosome studies and mutation analysis of the DCX and LIS1 genes gave negative results. This observation delineates a new multiple congenital abnormalities mental retardation syndrome and confirms genetic heterogeneity of SBH.
We describe a novel germline mutation of BMPR1A in a family with juvenile polyposis and colon cancer. This mutation consists of two consecutive substitutions (735-6 TG>AT) that cause two nonsense mutations (Y245X, G246X), inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, on one parental chromosome. This mutation caused protein truncation, and represents a novel case of consecutive nonsense mutations in human disease.
We describe a patient where intravenous injection of metoclopramide was immediately followed by asystole repeatedly. The patient received metoclopramide 10 mg i.v. five times during 48 h. After interviewing the attending nurses and reviewing the written documentation, it is clear that every administration of metoclopramide was immediately (within s) followed by asystole. The asystole lasted 15-30 s on four occasions, on one occasion it lasted 2 min. The patient received atropine 0.5-1 mg and chest compressions, before sinus rhythm again took over. We interpret this as episodes of cardiac arrest caused by metoclopramide. The rapid injection via the central venous route and the concomitant tapering of dopamine infusion might have contributed in precipitating the adverse drug reaction.
We describe a patient who developed dilated cardiomyopathy and clinical congestive heart failure after 2 months of therapy with amphotericin B (AmB) for disseminated coccidioidomycosis. His echocardiographic abnormalities and heart failure resolved after posaconazole was substituted for AmB. It is important to recognize the rare and potentially reversible toxicity of AmB.
We describe a patient who developed tetany with sudden respiratory arrest after the infusion of intravenous diltiazem. The administration of calcium chloride rapidly resolved the patient's tetany with prompt recovery of respiratory function, averting the need for more aggressive airway management and ventilatory support. The emergency physician should be aware that life-threatening tetany may accompany the administration of intravenous diltiazem and that calcium chloride may be a rapid and effective remedy.
We describe a patient with myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and angioedema associated with heterozygous complement factor 2 (C2) deficiency. The significance of this association is controversial, though the association of C2 deficiency with certain histocompatibility antigens suggests possible linkage to immune response genes. To our knowledge this is the first report of heterozygous C2 deficiency in association with this combination of autoimmune disorders, and we discuss the aetiological implications..
We describe a patient with typical clinical features of the fragile X syndrome, but without cytogenetic expression of the fragile X or an amplified CCG trinucleotide repeat fragment. The patient has a previously uncharacterized submicroscopic deletion encompassing the CCG repeat, the entire FMR1 gene and about 2. 5 megabases of flanking sequences. This finding confirms that the fragile X phenotype can exist, without amplification of the CCG repeat or cytogenetic expression of the fragile X, and that fragile X syndrome is a genetically homogeneous disorder involving FMR1. We also found random X-inactivation in the mother of the patient who was shown to be a carrier of this deletion.
We describe an 11-year-old girl suffering from recurrent meningitis with a complete absence of the seventh component of complement (C7). Diagnosis was established by haemolytic titration and western blotting. The patients serum lacked the 85 kDa C7 chain. Haemolytic activity of serum was reconstituted with either pooled normal human serum or with purified C7. The relatives (parents and one sister) had half-normal levels of both immunochemically and functionally determined C7, indicating a heterozygous state for C7 deficiency..
We describe an outbreak of deaths from cocaine-induced excited delirium (EDDs) in Dade County, Florida between 1979 and 1990. From a registry of all cocaine-related deaths in Dade County, Florida, from 1969-1990, 58 EDDs were compared with 125 victims of accidental cocaine overdose without excited delirium. Compared with controls, EDDs were more frequently black, male, and younger. They were less likely to have a low body mass index, and more likely to have died in police custody, to have received medical treatment immediately before death, to have survived for a longer period, to have developed hyperthermia, and to have died in summer months. EDDs had concentrations of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls. The epidemiologic findings are most consistent with the hypothesis that chronic cocaine use disrupts dopaminergic function and, when coupled with recent cocaine use, may precipitate agitation, delirium, aberrant thermoregulation, rhabdomyolysis, and sudden death.
We describe eight patients in whom cocaine use was related to stroke and review 39 cases from the literature. Among these 47 patients the mean (+/- SD) age was 32.5 +/- 12.1 years; 76% (34/45) were men. Stroke followed cocaine use by inhalation, intranasal, intravenous, and intramuscular routes. Intracranial aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations were present in 17 of 32 patients studied angiographically or at autopsy; cerebral vasculitis was present in two patients. Cerebral infarction occurred in 10 patients (22%), intracerebral hemorrhage in 22 (49%), and subarachnoid hemorrhage in 13 (29%). These data indicate that (1) the apparent incidence of stroke related to cocaine use is increasing; (2) cocaine-associated stroke occurs primarily in young adults; (3) stroke may follow any route of cocaine administration; (4) stroke after cocaine use is frequently associated with intracranial aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations; and (5) in cocaine-associated stroke, the frequency of intracranial hemorrhage exceeds that of cerebral infarction.
We describe herein 3 patients who developed rosacea-like dermatitis eruptions while using 0.03% or 0.1% tacrolimus ointment for facial dermatitis. Skin biopsy specimens showed telangiectasia and noncaseating epithelioid granulomatous tissue formation in the papillary to mid dermis. Continuous topical use of immunomodulators such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus should be regarded as a potential cause of rosaceiform dermatitis, although many cases have not been reported.
We describe oligonucleotide primer sequences that can be used to amplify eight exons plus the muscle promoter of the dystrophin gene in a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). When used in conjunction with an existing primer set, these two multiplex reactions detect about 98% of deletions in patients with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD, BMD). Furthermore, these primers amplify most of the exons in the deletion prone " hot spot " region around exons 44 to 53, allowing determination of deletion endpoints and prediction of mutational effects on the translational reading frame. Thus, use of these PCR-based assays will allow deletion detection and prenatal diagnosis for most DMD/BMD patients in a fraction of the time required for Southern blot analysis..
We describe seven Dutch patients from six families with a slowly progressive, mainly spinal cord syndrome that remained for many years the sole expression of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). MRI demonstrated white matter abnormalities in the lateral and dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Post-mortem examination of one of the patients showed extensive myelin loss in these columns. An array of genotypes was found in these patients. We conclude that spinal xanthomatosis is a clinical and radiological separate entity of CTX that should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic myelopathy..
We describe the cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts on five patients who presented in acute circulatory failure from myocardial dysfunction. Three patients had acute viral myocarditis, one had a carbamazepine-induced acute eosinophilic myocarditis, and one had cardiac hemosiderosis resulting in acute cardiogenic shock. All patients were continuously monitored with central venous and arterial catheters in addition to routine noninvasive monitoring. An introducer sheath, a pacemaker, and sterile pacing wires were made readily available for the patients, should the need arise to terminate resistant cardiac dysrhythmias. All patients developed cardiocirculatory arrest associated with extreme hypotension and dysrhythmias within the first 48 hours of their admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Right ventricular pacemaker wires were inserted in all of them during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In four patients, cardiac pacing was used, resulting in a temporary captured rhythm and restoration of their cardiac output. These patients had a second event of cardiac arrest, resulting in death, within 10 to 60 minutes. In one patient, cardiac pacing was not used, because he converted to normal sinus rhythm by electrical defibrillation within three minutes of initiating CPR. We conclude that cardiac pacing during resuscitative efforts in pediatric patients suffering from acute myocardial dysfunction may not have long-term value in and of itself; however, if temporary hemodynamic stability is achieved by this procedure, it may provide additional time needed to institute other therapeutic modalities.
We describe the cloning of p63, a gene at chromosome 3q27-29 that bears strong homology to the tumor suppressor p53 and to the related gene, p73. p63 was detected in a variety of human and mouse tissues, including proliferating basal cells of epithelial layers in the epidermis, cervix, urothelium, and prostate. Unlike p53, the p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. Importantly, the predominant p63 isotypes in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. We demonstrate that these truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63, and we suggest the possibility of physiological interactions among members of the p53 family.
We describe the complete beta-tubulin folding pathway. Folding intermediates produced via ATP-dependent interaction with cytosolic chaperonin undergo a sequence of interactions with four proteins (cofactors A, D, E, and C). The postchaperonin steps in the reaction cascade do not depend on ATP or GTP hydrolysis, although GTP plays a structural role in tubulin folding. Cofactors A and D function by capturing and stabilizing beta-tubulin in a quasi-native conformation. Cofactor E binds to the cofactor D-beta-tubulin complex; interaction with cofactor C then causes the release of beta-tubulin polypeptides that are committed to the native state. Sequence analysis identifies yeast homologs of cofactors D (cin1) and E (pac2), characterized by mutations that affect microtubule function.
We describe the first cases, to our knowledge, of C9 deficiency in Europe that were detected in a Swiss family, of which two members--one with a complete deficiency and the other with approximately half-normal C9 levels--experienced bacterial meningitis. The index patient, a 56-year-old white man with a history of purulent meningitis at the age of 23 years, presented with an acute meningococcal meningitis. No impairment of cellular immunity or immunoglobulin deficiency could be found. Complement assays showed a complete deficiency of the C9 component, while the other individual component levels were normal and the hemolytic activity (measured using the CH50 assay) was only slightly reduced. A family study revealed complete C9 deficiency in the patients healthy brother and half-normal C9 concentrations in his sister, his son (who also had experienced an episode of bacterial meningitis), and his niece, consistent with an inherited C9 deficiency. This first case of recurrent meningitis in a white patient with complete C9 deficiency suggests that this complement defect may also be a risk factor for bacterial, especially neisserial, infections..
We describe the induction of sustained remissions and possible cure of severe erosive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 2 patients. BMT was used to treat severe aplastic anemia which was caused by gold in one case and D-penicillamine in the other. In the 8 and 6 years since the transplants (representing 8 and 4 years since cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy, respectively), the RA in each case has been completely quiescent. Although short term remission of severe RA following BMT has been reported, these are the first cases for which prolonged followup has been available. This experience raises the question of the role of BMT itself as a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled destructive synovitis.
We describe the molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding a human brain Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate (P(i)) cotransporter (hBNPI). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of hBNPI reveal a protein of 560 amino acids with six to eight putative transmembrane segments. hBNPI shares a high degree of homology with other Na(+)-dependent inorganic P(i) cotransporters, including those found in rat brain and human and rabbit kidney. Expression of hBNPI in COS-1 cells results in Na(+)-dependent P(i) uptake. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that hBNPI mRNA is expressed predominantly in brain and most abundantly in neuron-enriched regions such as the amygdala and hippocampus. Moderate levels of expression are also observed in glia-enriched areas such as the corpus callosum, and low levels are observed in the substantia nigra, subthalamic nuclei, and thalamus. In situ hybridization histochemistry reveals relatively high levels of hBNPI mRNA in pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and in granule neurons of dentate gyrus. The level of hBNPI mRNA is quite low in fetal compared with adult human brain, suggesting developmental regulation of hBNPI gene expression. Southern analyses of nine eukaryotic genomic DNAs probed under stringent conditions with hBNPI cDNA revealed that the hBNPI gene is highly conserved during vertebrate evolution and that each gene is most likely present as a single copy. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we localized hBNPI to the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13) in close proximity to the late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease locus.
We describe three HEXA mutations associated with infantile Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) in three unrelated nonconsanguineous Chinese families. Novel mutations were found in two of these families. The third is a previously reported mutation (G-- > A transition at nt 1444) (Nakano et al., 1988). Direct sequencing of PCR products identified a novel insertion of an A after nt 547 in family 1. This change generates an early termination codon 6 bp downstream from the insertion site. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization confirmed homozygosity in the proband. Single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of amplified exon 13 revealed a T-- > C transition at nt 1453 with the corresponding amino acid substitution W485R in the second family. This mutation creates an Fnu4HI restriction site. The proband is homozygous for this allele. When the site-specific mutagenized alpha cDNA carrying the T-- > C transition at nt 1453 was expressed in COS 1 cells hexosaminidase S activity was not detectable above background. A G-- > A transition at nt 1444 (exon 13) corresponding to the E482K substitution was found in the third family. This mutation occurs at a CpG dinucleotide. It has been reported in an Italian TSD proband and causes defective intracellular transport of the alpha-subunit from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.
We describe three patients in whom severe, life-threatening hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency developed after treatment of acute gouty arthritis with indomethacin. This complication may result from an inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and consequent hyporeninemic hypoaidosteronism. Careful attention to renal function and potassium balance in patients receiving indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, particularly in those patients with diabetes mellitus or preexisting renal disease, will help prevent this potentially serious complication.
We describe two brothers with identical inherited deletions of one single exon within the middle of the DMD gene; one brother has Becker muscular dystrophy diagnosed at 11 years of age, whereas the older brother is normal at 18. These results have implications for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis in families with Becker muscular dystrophy..
We described 6 patients (from 3 families) affected with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). All are Sephardic Jews of Moroccan extraction. In view of the small number of CTX patients diagnosed in the world (a total of 50 including our 6 patients), we are probably dealing with an ethnic subgroup with a high CTX gene frequency, which we have estimated to be 1/108. Since there are differences in expression in this disease, we recommend cholestanol study in cases of undiagnosed cataract or tendinous xanthomas in childhood or early adolescence. The diagnosis in CTX is important not only for genetic counseling, but also in veiw of possible treatment..
We described a 15-year-old boy with Gardner syndrome (GS), mental retardation, and craniofacial abnormalities. High-resolution banding analysis showed an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (q22. 1----q31 1----q31. 1). The breakpoints in the present case and in 3 previously reported 5q- patients with adenomatous polyposis coli suggest that the gene responsible for GS/or familial polyposis coli (FPC) is in the 5q22 region, a result consistent with the findings of linkage studies
We determined 48 amino acid residues from five peptides from the homogeneous monomer of homogentisate 1, 2-dioxygenase (HGO; E. C. 1. 13. 11. 15) of mouse liver. After digestion with trypsin, peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography and amino acid sequenced. The deduced codon sequence of three peptides was used to derive degenerated oligomeres. By combining these oligos, we were able to amplify fragments from 100 to 300 bases (b) from mouse liver cDNA by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR). A fragment of 200 b was cloned and used as a probe to screen a mouse liver cDNA library. One clone from this library contained the complete cDNA-insert for HGO as determined by sequencing. The cDNA encodes for a protein of 50 kDa, as predicted. The cDNA of mouse HGO has an overall identity of 41% to the corresponding gene hmgA from Aspergillus. Sequence similarities to human expressed sequence tags (EST) clones ranged from 70% to 20%. The positions of 122 conserved amino acids could be determined by multiple sequence alignment. We identified one first intron of 928 b in the mouse gene. The gene for HGO seems to be expressed in various tissues, as shown by RT-PCR on different cDNAs. FISH experiments with the whole murine cDNA as probe clearly revealed signals at the human chromosomal band 3q13. 3-q21. This corresponds well to the previous assignment of the locus for the human alkaptonuria gene (AKU) to the same chromosomal region by multipoint linkage analysis. We therefore conclude that the HGO cDNA encodes the gene responsible for alkaptonuria.
We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54-yr-old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgens. When the androgens were withdrawn, the patient's physical changes, symptoms, sleep study, and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal. A rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone. Previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. Our report provides direct evidence for this role. Structural and functional measurements indicate that androgens exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep. Development of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must be considered a possible side effect of androgen therapy.
We earlier found an association between anorexia nervosa (AN) restrictive subtype (AN-R) and an inserted sequence within the NETpPR, a polymorphic region located in the promoter of the solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, noradrenalin) member 2 (SLC6A2) gene. To further examine the noradrenergic system in AN-R we performed an association study with a functional polymorphism (MAOA-uVNTR) in the promoter of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene. Since monoamine oxidase A metabolises noradrenalin, a positive association with the MAOA gene would be biologically plausible. The transmission disequilibrium test and 95 trios/duos (AN-R females+biological parents) showed the main effect of the longer, more transcriptionally active form of the MAOA-uVNTR (MAOA-L) to be statistically non-significant (McNemar's chi(2)=1.4, df=1, P=0.238, odds ratio: 1.4, 95% CI 0.8-2.7). A case-control approach supported this finding. We then stratified the MAOA-uVNTR TDT data according to the (a) NETpPR genotype of the AN-R females, and (b) NETpPR allele transmitted from NETpPR-S4/L4 heterozygous mothers. In both cases, contingency table analysis revealed previously unreported gene-gene interaction between the MAOA and SLC6A2 genes (P=0.019 and 0.019, respectively). Receiving an MAOA-L allele more than doubles the risk for developing AN-R, conditional on an individual also being a NETpPR-L4 homozygote (stratum-specific odds ratio: 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-6.0). These results suggest important involvement of the noradrenergic system in the biological underpinnings of AN-R.
We evaluated the association of alcohol consumption and depression, and their effects on HIV disease progression among women with HIV. The study included 871 women with HIV who were recruited from 1993-1995 in four US cities. The participants had physical examination, medical record extraction, and venipuncture, CD4+T-cell counts determination, measurement of depression symptoms (using the self-report Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale), and alcohol use assessment at enrollment, and semiannually until March 2000. Multilevel random coefficient ordinal models as well as multilevel models with joint responses were used in the analysis. There was no significant association between level of alcohol use and CD4+ T-cell counts. When participants were stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, the association between alcohol and CD4+ T-cell did not reach statistical significance. The association between alcohol consumption and depression was significant (p<0.001). Depression had a significant negative effect on CD4+ T-cell counts over time regardless of ART use. Our findings suggest that alcohol consumption has a direct association with depression. Moreover, depression is associated with HIV disease progression. Our findings have implications for the provision of alcohol use interventions and psychological resources to improve the health of women with HIV.
We evaluated the hypothesis that Huntington disease (HD) is influenced by the normal HD allele by comparing transmission patterns of genetically linked markers at the D4S10 locus in the normal parent against age at onset in the affected offspring. Analysis of information from 21 sibships in 14 kindreds showed a significant tendency for sibs who have similar onset ages to share the same D4S10 allele from the normal parent. Affected sibs who inherited different D4S10 alleles from the normal parent tended to have more variable ages at onset. These findings suggest that the expression of HD is modulated by the normal HD allele or by a closely linked locus..
We evaluated the severity of motor disability and dyskinesias in seven levodopa-responsive patients with Parkinson's disease after an acute challenge with the mixed dopamine agonist, apomorphine, before and after the administration of fluoxetine (20 mg twice per day) for 11 +/- 1 days. After fluoxetine treatment, there was a significant 47% improvement (p < 0.05) of apomorphine-induced dyskinesias without modification of parkinsonian motor disability. The dyskinesias were reduced predominantly in the lower limbs during the onset and disappearance of dystonic dyskinesias (onset- and end-of-dose dyskinesias) and in the upper limbs during choreic mid-dose dyskinesias. The results suggest that increased brain serotoninergic transmission with fluoxetine may reduce levodopa- or dopamine agonist-induced dyskinesias without aggravating parkinsonian motor disability.
We examined galactosylceramidase (GALC) cDNA in four Japanese patients with adult onset globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease; AO-GLD) by polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis, subsequent sequence determination, and restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products, initial symptoms were the onset of slowly progressive spastic paraplegia from the middle of the second decade, and all patients had diminished GALC activity in their leukocytes. We identified three missense mutations (I66M, G270D, L618S) and one exon-6 skipping (535-573del). Two of the patients had only the I66M mutant mRNA, and one only the G27OD mutant mRNA. The fourth patient carried a compound heterozygous mutation of 535-573del and L618S. To determine the enzymatic activities produced by these mutations, we constructed mutated GALC cDNAs and expressed them in COS-1 cells. Three mutations, viz., G270D, L618S, and exon-6 skipping (535-573del), produced diminished GALC activity as expected. The I66M mutation in the wild-type GALC cDNA (I289) had normal activity, but when this mutation and the V289 polymorphism were introduced into the same allele, it had decreased activity. Thus, the combination of a unique mutation and polymorphism causes conformational change in the GALC enzyme, resulting in low enzymatic activity. AO-GLD mutations, including those found here, are located in the N-terminus (I66M, G270D, 535-573del) or C-terminus (L618S) of the GALC enzyme, whereas the reported mutations in the infantile form (IF-GLD) are in the central domain. This difference in mutation sites may affect the clinical features of GLD.
We examined somatic mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in 63 colorectal tumors (16 adenomas and 47 carcinomas) developed in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and non-FAP patients. In addition to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the APC locus in 30 tumors, 43 other somatic mutations were detected. Twenty-one of them were point mutations; 16 nonsense and two missense mutations, and three occurred in introns at the splicing site. Twenty-two tumors had frameshift mutations due to deletion or insertion; nineteen of them were deletions of one to 31 bp and three were a 1-bp insertion. One tumor had a 1-bp deletion in an intron near the splicing site. Hence, 41 (95%) of 43 mutations resulted in truncation of the APC protein. Over 60% of the somatic mutations in the APC gene were clustered within a small region of exon 15, designated as MCR (mutation cluster region), which accounted for less than 10% of the coding region. Combining these data and the results of LOH, more than 80% of tumors (14 adenomas and 39 carcinomas) had at least one mutation in the APC gene, of which more than 60% (9 adenomas and 23 carcinomas) had two mutations. These results strongly suggest that somatic mutations of the APC gene are associated with development of a great majority of colorectal tumors..
We examined the potential role of prostaglandins in the development of analgesic nephropathy in the Gunn strain of rat. The homozygous Gunn rats have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to the absence of glucuronyl transferase, leading to marked bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papilla. These rats are also highly susceptible to develop papillary necrosis with analgesic administration. We used homozygous (jj) and phenotypically normal heterozygous (jJ) animals. Four groups of rats (n = 7) were studied: jj and jJ rats treated either with aspirin 300 mg/kg every other day or sham-treated. After one week, slices of cortex, outer and inner medulla from one kidney were incubated in buffer and prostaglandin synthesis was determined by radioimmunoassay. The other kidney was examined histologically. A marked corticomedullary gradient of prostaglandin synthesis was observed in all groups. PGE2 synthesis was significantly higher in outer medulla, but not cortex or inner medulla, of jj (38 +/- 6 ng/mg prot) than jJ rats (15 +/- 3) (p less than 0.01). Aspirin treatment reduced PGE2 synthesis in all regions, but outer medullary PGE2 remained higher in jj (18 +/- 3) than jJ rats (9 +/- 2) (p less than 0.05). PGF2 alpha was also significantly higher in the outer medulla of jj rats with and without aspirin administration (p less than 0.05). The changes in renal prostaglandin synthesis were accompanied by evidence of renal damage in aspirin-treated jj but not jJ rats as evidenced by: increased incidence and severity of hematuria (p less than 0.01); increased serum creatinine (p less than 0.05); and increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions (p less than 0.005 compared to either sham-treated jj or aspirin-treated jJ). These results suggest that enhanced prostaglandin synthesis contributes to maintenance of renal function and morphological integrity, and that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may lead to pathological renal medullary lesions and deterioration of renal function.
We extensively analyzed genomic DNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) from 62 unrelated Korean patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) for identification of germline adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations. We adopted both single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and a method of analysis involving the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by a protein truncation test (PTT). DNA sequencing confirmed all alterations represented by aberrant bands. Germline mutations were identified in 38 patients (61%). Nineteen of the detected mutations were presumed to be novel, thus emphasizing the heterogeneity of the mutational spectrum in Korean FAP patients. In the initial 48 patients, SSCP analysis was followed by PTT for those patients for whom no detectable mutations were found by SSCP. Using this combined approach, we identified germline APC gene mutations in 29 of the 48 FAP patients (60%), including 6 patients in whom SSCP analysis failed to distinguish the mutant allele. In the 14 later patients, we identified truncating mutations in 9 patients (64%) using PTT only. Our results confirm that the mutation detection rate with PTT was superior to that with SSCP, and suggest that PTT would be a more practical screening method to detect germline mutations of the APC gene in FAP patients.
We followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven years. Thirty-six of the 210 patients (17.2%) developed iridocyclitis. Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients (0 to 4 years) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis. However, 30% of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age. Although 61% of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry, 42% had active uveitis on entry. Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases. Forty-four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms, such as red eye, ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, or photophobia, in order of decreasing frequency. Even after early detection and prompt treatment, 41% of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics. Despite this, there was a dramatic decrease in the 50% incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studies. Cataract and band keratopathy occurred in only 22 and 13% of our group, respectively. We used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs. Systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found. Typical keratoconjunctivitis sicca developed in three of the uveitis cases. This association with uveitis and JRA was not noted previously. Surgical treatment of cataracts, band keratopathy, and glaucoma achieved uniformly discouraging results.
We have analysed over 300 patients suffering from Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD or BMD). Deletions have been characterised which encompass either the pERT87 (DXS164) locus only, the XJ1. 1 (DXS206) and HIP25 loci only, or all three loci. These loci have been shown to lie within the DMD region covering several hundred kilobases (kb) of DNA. One mildly affected BMD patient possesses a deletion of at least 110 kb including exons of the DMD gene. Other patients with similar exon deletions, or smaller deletions, show the more severe phenotype typical of DMD. We conclude from these studies that the severity of the clinical phenotype cannot be explained on the basis of the size of the deletion. We discuss this in the context of candidate gene sequences.
We have analyzed 20 breast-ovarian cancer families, the majority of which show positive evidence of linkage to chromosome 17q12 for germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 gene. BRCA1 mutations cosegregating with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility were identified in 16 families, including 1 family with a case of male breast cancer. Nine of these mutations have not been reported previously. The majority of mutations were found to generate a premature stop codon leading to the formation of a truncated BRCA1 protein of 2% -88% of the expected normal length. Two mutations altered the RING finger domain. Sequencing of genomic DNA led to the identification of a mutation in the coding region of BRCA1 in 12 families, and cDNA analysis revealed an abnormal or missing BRCA1 transcript in 4 of the 8 remaining families. A total of eight mutations were associated with a reduced quantity of BRCA1 transcript. We were unable to detect BRCA1 mutations in 4 of the 20 families, but only 1 of these was clearly linked to BRCA1. It is expected that the majority of clear examples of the breast-ovarian syndrome will be associated with germ-line mutations in the coding region of BRCA1..
We have analyzed a single multi-affected breast/ovarian cancer pedigree (BOV3) and have shown consistent inheritance of markers on chromosome 17q with the disease confirming that this family is due to the BRCA1 gene. Analysis of 17q haplotypes shows a recombination event in a bilateral breast cancer case which suggests that the BRCA1 gene lies distal to D17S857; D17S857 is thus the new proximal boundary for the region containing BRCA1. Combining this information with previously published mapping information suggests that BRCA1 is contained in a region estimated at 1-1. 5 Mb in length. All seven breast tumour/blood pairs examined from this family show loss of heterozygosity in the tumours. The allel retained in each tumour was from the disease-bearing chromosome implicating BRCA1 as a tumour suppressor gene. We have sequenced the 17 beta-oestradiol dehydrogenase genes (EDH17B1 and EDH17B2) which have been suggested as candidate genes for BRCA1 in four members of this family. No germline mutations were detected.
We have analyzed the 27 exons and the promoter region of the RB1 gene in familial or sporadic bilateral retinoblastoma by using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. For improvement over previous studies, a new set of primers has been designed, which allow for amplification of the coding and splicing sequences only. The positioning of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers was such that the resulting PCR products were of different sizes, which enabled us to analyze two different exons simultaneously and still distinguish between the banding profiles for both (biplex analysis). By using this approach, we were able to identify mutation in 22 new patients, but the overall efficiency of the procedure when we used a single-pass regimen was only 48%. The mutations were small insertions and deletions and point mutations in roughly equal proportions..
We have analyzed the stability of microsatellites in cell lines derived from human ovarian cancers and found that 5 out of 10 of the ovarian tumor cell lines are genetically unstable at the majority of the loci analyzed. In clones and subclones derived serially from one of these cell lines (2774; serous cystadenocarcinoma), a very high proportion of microsatellites distributed in many different regions of the genome change their size in a mercurial fashion. We conclude that genomic instability in ovarian tumors is a dynamic and ongoing process whose high frequency may have been previously underestimated by PCR-based allelotyping of bulk tumor tissue. We have identified the source of the genetic instability in one ovarian tumor as a point mutation (R524P) in the human mismatch-repair gene MSH2 (Salmonella MutS homologue), which has recently been shown to be involved in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Patient 2774 was a 38-year-old heterozygote, and her normal tissue carried both mutant and wild-type alleles of the human MSH2 gene. However the wild-type allele was lost at some point early during tumorigenesis so that DNA isolated either from the patients ovarian tumor or from the 2774 cell line carries only the mutant allele of the human MSH2 gene. The genetic instability observed in the tumor and cell line DNA, together with the germ-line mutation in a mismatch-repair gene, suggest that the MSH2 gene is involved in the onset and/or progression in a subset of ovarian cancer..
We have been using a differential cDNA cloning approach to isolate human retina-specific and retina-enriched genes [1]. A 1,314 bp cDNA was isolated by this approach, representing a highly retina-specific message encoding a 388 amino acid protein showing 58%, 50%, and 49% homology to bovine beta-arrestin, and bovine and human retinal arrestin (S-antigen), respectively. Chromosomal mapping localized this new arrestin gene to the proximal long arm of the X chromosome, hence it was named X-arrestin. In situ hybridization demonstrated its expression in the inner and outer segments and the inner plexiform regions of the retina.
We have brought together information on 864 affected individuals in 164 families (including three new pedigrees) reported in the 137 year period since 1845 when Demarquay first described a family with what was later called van der Woude syndrome (VWS). Both types of oral cleft, cleft palate (CP) and cleft lip with or without CP (CLP), segregate in these families together with lower lip pits or fistulae in an autosomal dominant mode with high penetrance estimated to be K =. 89 and. 99 by different methods. Cleft types (CLP and CP) occur in VWS in the same proportions as in the general non-VWS population, ie, about twice as many cleft-bearing individuals have CLP as have CP. On the other hand, we do not find the usually observed excess of females with CP and excess of males with CLP; in VWS the sex ratios are more nearly equal. Lip pits also are equally distributed between the sexes. Affected males and females are equally likely to transmit VWS. However, there is an excess of less severely affected individuals among transmitters and a deficiency of more severely affected, brought about by a proband bias and differential fecundity. The expression of VWS is significantly modified by the genetic background More extreme phenotypes in parents tend to produce more extreme expression in their children. For a VWS gene carrier the relative risk of transmitting a cleft is 26. 45%; that of transmitting lower lip pits is 23. 55%. Three pedigrees of lip pits in the literature show no clefts among a significant number of affected individuals. Control of gene expression in VWS in the three target tissues appears to be independent and separately designated. Mutation rate of the VWS gene is calculated to be 1. 8 X 10 (-5)
We have carried out a large-scale identification and characterization of human genes that activate the NF-kappaB and MARK signaling pathways. We constructed full-length cDNA libraries using the oligo-capping method and prepared an arrayed cDNA pool consisting of 150 000 cDNAs randomly isolated from the libraries. For analysis of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, we introduced each of the cDNAs into human embryonic kidney 293 cells and examined whether it activated the transcription of a luciferase reporter gene driven by a promoter containing the consensus NF-kappaB binding sites. In total, we identified 299 cDNAs that activate the NF-kappaB pathway, and we classified them into 83 genes, including 30 characterized activator genes of the NF-kappaB pathway, 28 genes whose involvement in the NF-kappaB pathways have not been characterized and 25 novel genes. We then carried out a similar analysis for the identification of genes that activate the MARK pathway, utilizing the same cDNA resource. We assayed 145 000 cDNAs and identified 57 genes that activate the MARK pathway. Interestingly, 27 genes were overlapping between the NF-kappaB and the MAPK pathways, which may indicate that these genes play cross-talking roles between these two pathways.
We have characterized expression of the familial breast and ovarian cancer gene, BRCA1, in cases of non-hereditary (sporadic) breast cancer and analyzed the effect of antisense inhibition of BRCA1 on the proliferative rate of mammary epithelial cells. BRCA1 mRNA levels are markedly decreased during the transition from carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer. Experimental inhibition of BRCA1 expression with antisense oligonucleotides produced accelerated growth of normal and malignant mammary cells, but had no effect on non-mammary epithelial cells. These studies suggest that BRCA1 may normally serve as a negative regulator of mammary epithelial cell growth whose function is compromised in breast cancer either by direct mutation or alterations in gene expression..
We have characterized two abundant human cDNAs which, through Northern hybridization analysis, are selectively expressed in human sarcomeric muscle. DNA sequencing was performed and the two cDNAs were found to share sequence identity, with the exception of a 3' UTR extension present on the longer transcript. Our data suggest that the two transcripts are generated through alternative use of two poly(A) addition signals. The cDNAs encode a large open reading frame encompassing at least 435 codons. Through sequence comparisons, both at the DNA and predicted amino acid sequence level, we have been unable to find significant sequence similarity to any other characterized sequence. Consequently, we have termed this novel human sequence sarcosin. Although novel, Southern hybridization analysis demonstrated that the sarcosin sequence has been conserved in several mammalian species.
We have cloned a human ATP-dependent protease that is highly homologous to members of the bacterial Lon protease family. The cloned gene encodes a protein of 963 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 106 kDa, slightly higher than that observed by Western blotting the protein from human tissues and cell lines (100 kDa). A single species of mRNA was found for this Lon protease in all human tissues examined. The protease is encoded in the nucleus, and the amino-terminal portion of the protein sequence contains a potential mitochondrial targeting presequence. Immunofluorescence microscopy suggested a predominantly mitochondrial localization for the Lon protease in cultured human cells. A truncated LON gene, in which translation was initiated at Met118 of the coding sequence, was expressed in Escherichia coli and produced a protease that degraded alpha-casein in vitro in an ATP-dependent manner and had other properties similar to E. coli Lon protease.
We have cloned a novel adapter protein containing Src homology 2 and Src homology 3 domains similar to the Src family of tyrosine kinases. This molecule lacks a catalytic tyrosine kinase domain and is related to a previously identified protein, Src-like adapter protein (SLAP), and is therefore designated SLAP-2. Northern blot analysis indicates that SLAP-2 is predominantly expressed in the immune system. Jurkat T cells express SLAP-2 protein and overexpression of SLAP-2 in these cells negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling as assessed by interleukin-2 promoter or NF-AT promoter reporter constructs. Mutational analysis revealed that an intact SH2 domain of SLAP-2 is essential for this inhibitory effect, whereas mutation of the SH3 domain alone has no effect. This inhibitory effect is upstream of the activation of Ras and increase of intracellular calcium levels, as no inhibition was observed when the cells were activated by phorbol ester plus ionomycin. SLAP-2 interacts with Cbl in vivo in a phosphorylation independent manner and with ZAP-70 and T cell receptor zeta chain upon T cell receptor activation. Finally, we show that the mutation of a predicted myristoylation site within the NH(2)-terminal of SLAP-2 is essential for its inhibitory effect. This report therefore implicates SLAP and SLAP-2 as a family of adapter proteins that negatively regulate T cell receptor signaling.
We have cloned a novel serine/threonine protein kinase (PK428) which is highly related (65%) within the kinase domain to the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DM-PK), as well as the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (33%). Northern blots demonstrate that PK428 mRNA is distributed widely among tissues and is expressed at the highest levels in pancreas, heart, and skeletal muscle, with lower levels in liver and lung. Two PK428 mRNAs 10 and 3.8 kilobase pairs in size are seen in a number of cell lines, including hematopoietic and breast cancer cells. An antibody generated to a glutathione S-transferase-PK428 fusion protein detects a 65-kDa protein in these cell lines, and a similarly sized protein when the cloned cDNA is transiently expressed in Cos 7 cells. Immunoprecipitation of the transiently expressed PK428 protein and incubation with [gamma-32P]ATP demonstrate that it is capable of autophosphorylation. In addition, immunoprecipitates of the PK428 protein kinase also phosphorylated histone H1 and a peptide encoding a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase substrate. The gene corresponding to the 3.8-kb PK428 mRNA, and its corresponding 65-kDa protein, was isolated by polymerase chain reaction screening of a P1 phage human genomic library. Using this P1 phage clone as a probe, the PK428 gene was located on 1q41-42, a possible location for a human senescence gene, a gene associated with Rippling muscle disease, as well as a region associated with genetically acquired mental retardation.
We have cloned and characterized a putative protein serine/threonine kinase termed prk through a combination of polymerase chain reaction and conventional cDNA library screening approaches. There are apparently two distinct domains within prk protein deduced from its nucleotide sequences. The amino-terminal portion has the feature of the catalytic domain of a serine/threonine kinase and shows strong homology to mouse fnk and other polo family kinases including mouse snk, human and murine plk, Drosophila polo, and yeast Cdc5. The carboxyl-terminal portion, presumably the regulatory domain, shares extensive homology to mouse fnk. Northern blotting analyses reveal that prk expression is restricted to a very limited number of tissues with placenta, ovaries, and lung containing detectable amounts of prk mRNA. prk mRNA expression is also detected at a low level in the megakaryocytic cell line Dami, MO7e, and three brain glioma cell lines. In addition, refeeding of serum-deprived MO7e, Dami, and K562 cells of hematopoietic origin and GMOO637D of lung fibroblasts rapidly activates prk mRNA expression with its peak induction around 2 h after serum addition. prk gene activation by the serum requires no new protein synthesis. The recombinant cytokines such as interleukin-3 and thrombopoietin also activate prk mRNA expression in MO7e cells. Furthermore, a survey of RNAs isolated from the tumor and the uninvolved tissues from 18 lung cancer patients reveals that prk mRNA expression is significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues. Southern blotting analysis indicates that the prk gene is present in a single copy in the genome of tumors and normal cells. Taken together, these results suggest that prk expression may be restricted to proliferating cells and involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression. The molecular cloning of prk cDNA will facilitate the study of its biological role as well as its potential role in tumorigenesis.
We have cloned full-length human and mouse cDNAs of ABCB9, which encodes a predicted multiple-spanning transmembrane domain and a nucleotide-binding domain with Walker motifs. It is therefore designated as a "half" ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Northern analysis shows that the ABCB9 mRNA is expressed at a high level in testes and moderate levels in brain and spinal cord. A splice variant mRNA deleted in the last pair of predicted transmembrane segments was shown to be expressed in human tissues. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that ABCB9 is closely related to TAP1 and TAP2, two "half" ABC proteins found in endoplasmic reticulum. ABCB9 protein colocalized with the lysosomal markers, LAMP1 and LAMP2, in transfected cells. ABCB9 protein appears to be most highly expressed in the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules in mouse and rat testes. These cells have high levels of phagocytosis and secretory activities. These findings pave the way for further investigation into the potential novel function of ABCB9 in lysosomes.
We have cloned the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, mCB2, from a mouse splenocyte cDNA library. The 3.7 kb sequence contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 347 residues sharing 82% overall identity with the only other known peripheral receptor, human CB2 (hCB2) and shorter than hCB2 by 13 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. Binding experiments with membranes from COS-3 cells transiently expressing mCB2 showed that the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55212-2 had a 6-fold lower affinity for mCB2 than for hCB2, whereas both receptors showed similar affinities for the agonists CP 55,940, delta(9)-THC and anandamide and almost no affinity for the central receptor- (CB1) specific antagonist SR 141716A. Both hCB2 and mCB2 mediate agonist-stimulated inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production in CHO cell lines permanently expressing the receptors. SR 141716A failed to antagonize this activity in either cell line, confirming its specificity for CB1.
We have compared, in 60 adult patients, the cardiovascular effects of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg-1 and 10 micrograms kg-1 given either simultaneously or 1 min before edrophonium 1 mg kg-1. Significant differences between the four groups were detected (P less than 0.001). Both groups receiving 10 micrograms kg-1 showed increases in heart rate of up to 30 beat min-1 (95% confidence limits 28-32 beat min-1). Use of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg-1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and, given 1 min before the edrophonium, was sufficient to minimize early, edrophonium-induced bradycardias. This low dose of glycopyrronium provided good control of oropharyngeal secretions.
We have constructed a physical map covering over 4 Mb of human chromosome 8q24. 1 and used this map to refine the locations of the genes responsible for Langer-Giedion syndrome. The map is composed of overlapping YAC clones that were identified and ordered in relation to sequence tagged sites mapped to the Langer-Giedion chromosomal region on somatic cell hybrids. The minimal region of overlap of Langer-Giedion syndrome deletions, previously identified by analysis of 15 patients, was placed on the map by analysis of 2 patients whose deletions define the endpoints. The chromosome 8 breakpoint of a balanced t (8; 9) (q24. 11; q33. 3) translocation from a patient with trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (TRPS I) was found to be located just within the proximal end of the minimal deletion region. A deletion of 8q24. 11-q24. 3 in a patient with multiple exostoses was found to overlap the distal end of the LGS deletion region, indicating that the EXT1 gene is distal to the TRPS1 gene and supporting the hypothesis that Langer-Giedion syndrome is due to loss of functional copies of both the TRPS1 and the EXT1 genes
We have constructed a physical map of a 4 cM region on chromosome 17q12-21 that contains the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene BRCA1. The map comprises a contig of 137 overlapping yeast artificial chromosomes and P1 clones, onto which we have placed 112 PCR markers. We have localized more than 20 genes on this map, ten of which had not been mapped to the region previously, and have isolated 30 cDNA clones representing partial sequences of as yet unidentified genes. Two genes that lie within a narrow region defined by meiotic breakpoints in BRCA1 patients have been sequenced in breast cancer patients without revealing any deleterious mutations. These new reagents should facilitate the identification of BRCA1..
We have described a patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis and a history of mefenamic acid nephropathy in whom hyperkalemia and inappropriate hypoaldosteronism were caused by both indomethacin and naproxen, without major decline in renal function. It is likely that preexisting renal disease predisposed this patient to type IV renal tubular acidosis with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors. Because he was unable to discontinue nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, fludrocortisone was added, correcting the hyperkalemia and allowing indomethacin therapy to be continued safely.
We have described a protein (Hep27) [Donadel, G., Garzelli, C., Frank, R. & Gabrielli, F. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 195, 723-729] which is synthesized and accumulated in the nucleus of human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells, following growth arrest induced by butyrate treatment. The synthesis of Hep27 is inhibited in cells that, released from the butyrate block, have resumed DNA synthesis. This report describes the cloning and the characterization of the cDNA coding for the Hep27 protein. The translation of the Hep27 cDNA predicts an amino acid sequence that can be aligned with those of the known short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes (SCAD) family. Both the recognition of enzymic functional domains and the similarity with the SCAD family of proteins of several amino acid blocks throughout the molecule, strongly suggest that this protein is a new member of the SCAD family. In agreement with its nuclear localization Hep27 has a region similar to the bipartite nuclear-targeting sequence. The study of Hep27 mRNA expression and protein synthesis suggests the existence of a regulation at the post-transcriptional level. The possible nuclear role of the Hep27 protein is discussed.
We have described a unique patient who had reversible and dose-related myasthenia gravis after penicillamine and chloroquine therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Although acetylcholine receptor antibodies were not detectable, the time course was consistent with an autoimmune process.
We have developed a rapid and simple method to diagnose the molecular defects of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in Chinese in Taiwan. This method involves the selective amplification of a DNA fragment from human G6PD gene with specific oligonucleotide primers followed by digestion with restriction enzymes that recognize artificially created or naturally occurring restriction sites. Ninety-four Chinese males with G6PD deficiency were studied. The results show that 50% (47 of 94) were G to T mutation at nucleotide (nt) 1376, 21. 3% (20 of 94) were G to A mutation at nt 1388, 7. 4% (7 of 94) were A to G mutation at nt 493, 7. 4% (7 of 94) were A to G mutation at nt 95, 4. 2% (4 of 94) were C to T mutation at nt 1024, 1. 1% (1 of 94) was G to T mutation at nt 392, and 1. 1% (1 of 94) was G to A mutation at nt 487. These results show that the former five mutations account for more than 90% of G6PD deficiency cases in Taiwan. Aside from showing that G to T change at nt 1376 is the most common mutation, our research indicates that nt 493 mutation is a frequent mutation among Chinese in Taiwan. We compared G6PD activity among different mutations, without discovering significant differences between them.
We have developed a simple method to test whether a hydrophobic segment near the N-terminus of a protein functions as a type II signal anchor (SA) in which the N-terminus faces the cytoplasm. A cDNA fragment containing the putative SA sequence of a target clone was fused in-frame to the 5' end of a cDNA fragment encoding the protease domain of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). The resulting fused gene was expressed in COS7 cells. Fibrinolytic activity on the cell surface was measured by placing a fibrin sheet in contact with the transfected COS7 cells after removing the medium. When the cDNA fragment encoded a SA, the fibrin sheet was lysed by the u-PA expressed on the cell surface. The fibrinolytic activity was not detected in the culture medium, suggesting that the u-PA remains on the cell surface anchored via the SA in the membrane without being cleaved by signal peptidase. This fibrin sheet method was successfully applied to select five novel cDNA clones encoding putative type II membrane proteins from a human full-length cDNA bank.
We have devised a complementation assay in yeast to clone mammalian transcriptional activators and have used it to identify a human basic leucine-zipper transcription factor that we have designated Nrf1 for NF-E2-related factor 1. Nrf1 potentially encodes a 742-aa protein and displays marked homology to the mouse and human NF-E2 transcription factors. Nrf1 activates transcription via NF-E2 binding sites in yeast cells. The ubiquitous expression pattern of Nrf1 and the range of promoters containing the NF-E2 binding motif suggest that this gene may play a role in the regulation of heme synthesis and ferritin genes.
We have estimated the haplotype distribution of mutant and normal phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) alleles for 17 Turkish phenylketonuria (PKU) families 20 normal and 27 mutated PAH alleles could be identified. Of the latter, the most prevalent were associated with haplotype 6 (29. 6%), 1 (18. 5%) and 36 (11. 1%), while the normal alleles were preferentially associated with haplotype 1 (20%). Of the 19 different haplotypes observed, 5 have not been described previously. The haplotype distribution differed significantly from that of the Northern European population. Two of the eight polymorphic sites were in association with PKU. No deletions of exon sequences were found in the families analysed.
We have evaluated the hypothesis of a negative association between glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and cancer in a cohort of 481 Sardinian males with hematological malignancies. The frequency of G6PD deficiency in the patients was not different from the incidence in a group of 16, 219 controls. The same conclusion resulted from the comparison of the frequency of expression of the GdB gene in 23 heterozygous women having a clonal hematologic disease and a control group of 37 healthy heterozygotes. Therefore at present there is no evidence that G6PD deficiency has a protective effect against development of hematologic neoplasms..
We have examined 26 Canadian families with hereditary breast or ovarian cancer for linkage to markers flanking the BRCA1 gene on chromosome 17q12-q21. Of the 15 families that contain cases of ovarian cancer, 94% were estimated to be linked to BRCA1. In contrast, there was no overall evidence of linkage in the group of 10 families with breast cancer without ovarian cancer. A genetic recombinant in a breast-ovarian cancer family indicates a placement of BRCA1 telomeric to D17S776, and helps to define the region of assignment of the cancer susceptibility gene. Other cancers of interest that appeared in the BRCA1-linked families included primary peritoneal cancer, cancer of the fallopian tube, and malignant melanoma..
We have examined the effect of systemic administration of ketamine and lidocaine on brush-evoked (dynamic) pain and punctate-evoked (static) hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we studied 12 volunteers in three experiments. Capsaicin 100 micrograms was injected intradermally on the volar forearm followed by an i.v. infusion of ketamine (bolus 0.1 mg kg-1 over 10 min followed by infusion of 7 micrograms kg-1 min-1), lidocaine 5 mg kg-1 or saline for 50 min. Infusion started 15 min after injection of capsaicin. The following were measured: spontaneous pain, pain evoked by punctate and brush stimuli (VAS), and areas of brush-evoked and punctate-evoked hyperalgesia. Ketamine reduced both the area of brush-evoked and punctate-evoked hyperalgesia significantly and it tended to reduce brush-evoked pain. Lidocaine reduced the area of punctate-evoked hyperalgesia significantly. It tended to reduce VAS scores of spontaneous pain but had no effect on evoked pain. The differential effects of ketamine and lidocaine on static and dynamic hyperalgesia suggest that the two types of hyperalgesia are mediated by separate mechanisms and have a distinct pharmacology.
We have found an allelic deletion of the haptoglobin (Hp) gene from an individual with anhaptoglobinemia. The Hp gene cluster consists of coding regions of the alpha chain and beta chain of the haptoglobin gene (Hp) and of the alpha chain and beta chain of the haptoglobin-related gene (Hpr), in tandem from the 5 side. Southern blot and PCR analyses have indicated that the individual with anhaptoglobinemia was homozygous for the gene deletion and that the gene deletion was included at least from the promoter region of Hp to Hpr alpha but not to Hpr beta (Hpdel). In addition, we found seven individuals with hypohaptoglobinemia in three families, and the genotypes of six of the seven individuals were found to be Hp2/Hpdel. The phenotypes and genotypes in one of these three families showed the father to be hypohaptoglobinemic (Hp2) and Hp2/Hpdel, the mother to be Hp2-1 and Hp1/Hp2, one of the two children to be hypohaptoglobinemic (Hp2) and Hp2/Hpdel, and the other child to be Hp1 and Hp1/Hpdel, showing an anomalous inheritance of Hp phenotypes in the child with Hp1. The Hp2/Hpdel individuals had an extremely low level of Hp (mean +/-SD = 0. 049 +/-0. 043 mg/ml; n = 6), compared with the level (1. 64 +/-1. 07 mg/ml) obtained from 52 healthy volunteers having phenotype Hp2, whereas the serum Hp level of an individual with Hp1/Hpdel was 0. 50 mg/ml, which was approximately half the level of Hp in control sera from the Hp1 phenotype (1. 26 +/-0. 33 mg/ml; n = 9), showing a gene-dosage effect. The other allele (Hp2) of individuals with Hp2/Hpdel was found to have, in all exons, no mutation, by DNA sequencing. On the basis of the present study, the mechanism of anhaptoglobinemia and the mechanism of anomalous inheritance of Hp phenotypes were well explained. However, the mechanism of hypohaptoglobinemia remains unknown
We have found four mutations in the human gene encoding the beta-subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE beta) that cosegregate with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative disease of photoreceptors. In one family two affected siblings both carry allelic nonsense mutations at codons 298 and 531. Affected individuals have abnormal rod and cone electroretinograms. PDE beta is the second member of the phototransduction cascade besides rhodopsin that is absent or altered as a cause of retinitis pigmentosa, suggesting that other members of this pathway may be defective in other forms of this disease.
We have generated a mouse model for ataxia-telangiectasia by using gene targeting to generate mice that do not express the Atm protein. Atm-deficient mice are retarded in growth, do not produce mature sperm, and exhibit severe defects in T cell maturation while going on to develop thymomas. Atm-deficient fibroblasts grow poorly in culture and display a high level of double-stranded chromosome breaks. Atm-deficient thymocytes undergo spontaneous apoptosis in vitro significantly more than controls. Atm-deficient mice then exhibit many of the same symptoms found in ataxia-telangiectasia patients and in cells derived from them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Atm protein exists as two discrete molecular species, and that loss of one or of both of these can lead to the development of the disease..
We have identified 14 families with ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) in which mutation of the ATM gene is associated with a less severe clinical and cellular phenotype (approximately 10% -15% of A-T families identified in the United Kingdom). In 10 of these families, all the homozygotes have a 137-bp insertion in their cDNA caused by a point mutation in a sequence resembling a splice-donor site. The second A-T allele has a different mutation in each patient. We show that the less severe phenotype in these patients is caused by some degree of normal splicing, which occurs as an alternative product from the insertion-containing allele. The level of the 137-bp PCR product containing the insertion was lowest in two patients who showed a later onset of cerebellar ataxia. A further four families who do not have this insertion have been identified. Mutations detected in two of four of these are missense mutations, normally rare in A-T patients. The demonstration of mutations giving rise to a slightly milder phenotype in A-T raises the interesting question of what range of phenotypes might occur in individuals in whom both mutations are milder. One possibility might be that individuals who are compound heterozygotes for ATM mutations are more common than we realize..
We have identified 52 novel human cadherin-like genes organized into three closely linked clusters. Comparison of the genomic DNA sequences with those of representative cDNAs reveals a striking genomic organization similar to that of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene clusters. The N-terminal extracellular and transmembrane domains of each cadherin protein are encoded by a distinct and unusually large exon. These exons are organized in a tandem array. By contrast, the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of each protein is identical and is encoded by three small exons located downstream from the cluster of N-terminal exons. This unusual organization has interesting implications regarding the molecular code required to establish complex networks of neuronal connections in the brain and the mechanisms of cell-specific cadherin-like gene expression.
We have identified a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) pedigree where the disease is associated with a molecular deletion within the DMD locus. We have examined the meiotic segregation products of the common female ancestor using marker restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) detected by probes that lie within this deletion. These studies show that this female has transmitted three distinct types of X chromosome to her offspring. This observation may be explained by postulating that the mutation arose as a postzygotic deletion within this common ancestor, who was consequently germinally mosaic..
We have identified a new mutation of Norrie disease (ND) gene in two Japanese males from unrelated families; they showed typical ocular features of ND but no mental retardation or hearing impairment. A mutation was found in both patients at the initiation codon of exon 2 of the ND gene (ATG to GTG), with otherwise normal nucleotide sequences. Their mothers had the normal and mutant types of the gene, which was expected for heterozygotes of the disease. The mutation of the initiation codon would cause the failure of ND gene expression or a defect in translation thereby truncating the amino terminus of ND protein. In view of the rarity and marked heterogeneity of mutations in the ND gene, the present apparently unrelated Japanese families who have lived in the same area for over two centuries presumably share the origin of the mutation..
We have identified a novel cDNA encoding a protein (named TX) with > 50% overall sequence identity with the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) and approximately 30% sequence identity with the ICE homologs NEDD-2/ICH-1L and CED-3. A computer homology model of TX was constructed based on the X-ray coordinates of the ICE crystal recently published. This model suggests that TX is a cysteine protease, with the P1 aspartic acid substrate specificity retained. Transfection experiments demonstrate that TX is a protease which is able to cleave itself and the p30 ICE precursor, but not to generate mature IL-1 beta from pro-IL-1 beta. In addition, this protein induces apoptosis in transfected COS cells. TX therefore delineates a new member of the growing Ice/ced-3 gene family coding for proteases with cytokine processing activity or involved in programmed cell death.
We have identified a novel gene containing CAG repeats and mapped it to chromosome 14q32. 1, the genetic locus for Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). In normal individuals the gene contains between 13 and 36 CAG repeats, whereas most of the clinically diagnosed patients and all of the affected members of a family with the clinical and pathological diagnosis of MJD show expansion of the repeat-number (from 68-79). Southern blot analyses and genomic cloning demonstrates the existence of related genes. These results raise the possibility that similar abnormalities in related genes may give rise to diseases similar to MJD.
We have identified a novel gene, Translin, encoding a protein which specifically binds to consensus sequences at breakpoint junctions of chromosomal translocations in many cases of lymphoid malignancies. The encoded protein, Translin, is a previously undescribed type with no significant similarity to known proteins. In the native form, Translin polypeptides form a multimeric structure which is responsible for its DNA binding activity. Nuclear localization of Translin is limited to lymphoid cell lines, raising the intriguing possibility that nuclear transport of Translin is regulated in a physiologically significant way such that active nuclear transport is associated with the lymphoid specific process known as Ig/TCR gene rearrangement.
We have identified a novel human cDNA with a predicted protein sequence that has 28% amino acid identity with the E. coli Hsp70 co-chaperone GrpE and designated it HMGE. Even with this low level of amino acid identity the human sequence could be efficiently modelled on the X-ray structure of the E. coli protein, suggesting that there may be significant functional conservation. Indeed, HMGE expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein co-purified with the E. coli Hsp70 protein DnaK in the absence of ATP. DnaK could be released from the GST-HMGE with a Mg-ATP wash. Subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry studies using antisera raized against HMGE show that it is a mitochondrial protein. In contrast to studies of rat GrpE, however, HMGE also appears to bind the constitutive cytosolic Hsp70, Hsc70, in addition to mitochondrial Hsp70, Mt-Hsp70. We have previously shown that Hsc70 nucleotide-exchange is rate limiting in the presence of the DnaJ-protein, HSJ1b. However, HMGE was found to inhibit the HSJ1b-enhanced Hsc70 ATPase activity and may mediate this inhibition by binding the DnaJ-protein, HSJ1b. This is the first description of a direct interaction between a DnaJ protein and GrpE-like protein. These studies suggest that the structure of GrpE has been conserved throughout evolution and that the conserved structure can interact with several forms of Hsp70, but that HMGE cannot form part of the reaction cycle for cytosolic Hsc70.
We have identified a novel ubiquitin conjugating enzyme gene, L-UBC, which maps to human Chromosome (Chr) 14q24.3. This is also the location of the major early onset familial Alzheimer's disease gene (FAD3). L-UBC encodes a protein that demonstrates homology to the yeast ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, UBC-4, and human UbcH5. Their functions are to ubiquitinate specific proteins targeted for degradation. The protein also exhibits very strong homology to a rabbit protein, E2-F1, which mediates p53 degradation driven by papilloma virus E6 protein in vitro. The accumulation of specific proteins that have undergone aberrant processing in neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques is the classic pathological feature in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Abnormal ubiquitination has previously been suggested to play a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. This gene therefore represents a plausible candidate gene for FAD3.
We have identified a type II Ca2+-dependent lectin displaying mannose-binding specificity, exclusively expressed by Langerhans cells (LC), and named Langerin. LC are uniquely characterized by Birbeck granules (BG), which are organelles consisting of superimposed and zippered membranes. Here, we have shown that Langerin is constitutively associated with BG and that antibody to Langerin is internalized into these structures. Remarkably, transfection of Langerin cDNA into fibroblasts created a compact network of membrane structures with typical features of BG. Langerin is thus a potent inducer of membrane superimposition and zippering leading to BG formation. Our data suggest that induction of BG is a consequence of the antigen-capture function of Langerin, allowing routing into these organelles and providing access to a nonclassical antigen-processing pathway.
We have identified and characterized Diva, which is a novel regulator of apoptosis. Sequence analysis revealed that Diva is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins containing Bcl-2 homology domain 1, 2, 3, and 4 (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4) regions and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain. The expression of Diva mRNA was detected in multiple embryonic tissues but was restricted to the ovary and testis in adult mice. The expression of Diva promoted the death of 293T, Ramsey, and T47D cells as well as that of primary sensory neurons, indicating that Diva is a proapoptotic protein. Significantly, Diva lacks critical residues in the conserved BH3 region that mediate the interaction between BH3-containing proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues and their prosurvival binding partners. Consistent with this, Diva did not bind to cellular Bcl-2 family members including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1/Bfl-1. Furthermore, mutants of Diva lacking the BH3 region fully retained their proapoptotic activity, confirming that Diva promotes apoptosis in a BH3-independent manner. Significantly, Diva interacted with a viral Bcl-2 homologue (vBcl-2) encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Consistent with these associations, apoptosis induced by Diva was inhibited by vBcl-2 but not by Bcl-XL. Importantly, Diva interacted with Apaf-1, an adapter molecule that activates caspase-9, a central death protease of the apoptotic pathway. The expression of Diva inhibited the binding of Bcl-XL to Apaf-1, as determined by immunoprecipitation assays. Thus, Diva represents a novel type of proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologue that promotes apoptosis independently of the BH3 region through direct binding to Apaf-1, thus preventing Bcl-XL from binding to the caspase-9 regulator Apaf-1.
We have identified and cloned human cDNA for the Ca2+-binding subunit of calcineurin, the brain isozyme of the Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase. The 2.5-kb cDNA has an open reading frame of 510 bp, a leader sequence of at least 500 bp, and a 1,277-bp 3'-noncoding sequence. The deduced sequence of the human protein differs from bovine brain calcineurin B by an additional valine at the carboxyl terminus and substitution of Met-11 and Ser-153 by cysteine. A partial clone of the mouse protein corresponding to amino acids 75-150 was also isolated. This portion of the human and mouse protein sequence is identical, with the DNA sequences showing 94% identity. The respective mRNAs in human and mouse are also of similar size. As was observed with protein levels, mRNA abundance in brain is 20-60 times that found in other tissues with the exception of HeLa cells which, like brain, contain abundant calcineurin B mRNA.
We have identified four mutations in each of the breast cancer-susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, in French Canadian breast cancer and breast/ovarian cancer families from Quebec. To identify founder effects, we examined independently ascertained French Canadian cancer families for the distribution of these eight mutations. Mutations were found in 41 of 97 families. Six of eight mutations were observed at least twice. The BRCA1 C4446T mutation was the most common mutation found, followed by the BRCA2 8765delAG mutation. Together, these mutations were found in 28 of 41 families identified to have a mutation. The odds of detection of any of the four BRCA1 mutations was 18. 7x greater if one or more cases of ovarian cancer were also present in the family. The odds of detection of any of the four BRCA2 mutations was 5. 3x greater if there were at least five cases of breast cancer in the family. Interestingly, the presence of a breast cancer case < 36 years of age was strongly predictive of the presence of any of the eight mutations screened. Carriers of the same mutation, from different families, shared similar haplotypes, indicating that the mutant alleles were likely to be identical by descent for a mutation in the founder population. The identification of common BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations will facilitate carrier detection in French Canadian breast cancer and breast/ovarian cancer families.
We have investigated the myelin P0 gene on chromosome 1 as a candidate gene in two sporadic cases with Dejerine-Sottas disease or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) type III. We found different mutations, a cysteine substitution for serine 63 in the extracellular domain and an arginine substitution for glycine 167 in the transmembrane domain. The patients were genetically heterozygous for the normal allele and the mutant allele, which was absent in their parents and in one hundred unrelated, healthy controls. The results strongly suggest that a de novo dominant mutation of the P0 gene is responsible for at least some sporadic cases of Dejerine-Sottas disease.
We have isolated a 1918-bp cDNA from a human adrenal cDNA library which encodes a novel thioredoxin reductase (TrxR2) of 521 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 56.2 kDa. It is highly homologous to the previously described cytosolic enzyme (TrxR1), including the conserved active site CVNVGC and the FAD-binding and NADPH-binding domains. However, human TrxR2 differs from human TrxR1 by the presence of a 33-amino acid extension at the N-terminus which has properties characteristic of a mitochondrial translocation signal. Northern-blot analysis identified one mRNA species of 2.2 kb with highest expression in prostate, testis and liver. We expressed human TrxR2 as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein and showed that in vivo it is localized in mitochondria. Removal of the mitochondrial targeting sequence abolishes the mitochondrial translocation. Finally, we determined the genomic organization of the human TrxR2 gene, which consists of 18 exons spanning about 67 kb, and its chromosomal localization at position 22q11.2.
We have isolated a cDNA clone which encodes the entire beta-subunit of human electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) by screening an expression library from human liver using polyclonal antibodies against porcine ETF. This cDNA encodes a protein of 255 amino-acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 27,877 Da which shows a high degree of similarity with partial amino-acid sequences obtained from both rat liver and Paracoccus denitrificans beta-ETF. Northern-blot analysis shows that the human beta-ETF mRNA is approximately 1 kb in size and is abundant in liver, heart and skeletal muscle. Incubation with intact mitochondria indicates that the cDNA-encoded beta-ETF polypeptide contains the information necessary to reach the mitochondrial matrix. These data are in agreement with previous experiments suggesting that beta-ETF, unlike the majority of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial matrix proteins, does not have a cleavable leader peptide. Furthermore, when valinomycin is added to the incubation mixture, the import is abolished, thus demonstrating that it is an energy-dependent process. Interestingly, the sequence analysis of beta-ETF protein identifies a 26.3% identity with the Fix A gene product of the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azorhizobium caulinodans.
We have isolated a cDNA encoding a third type of protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. We screened human megakaryoblastic cell line (MEG-01) an umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA libraries to obtain a 3.7-kilobase cDNA designated PTPase MEG. Northern blot analysis of MEG-01 RNA detected a 3.7-kilobase transcript, suggesting that a full-length cDNA has been identified. PTPase MEG cDNA contains an open reading frame of 926 amino acids. The cDNA has a G+C-rich 5' untranslated region of 771 nucleotides that has the potential to form stable stem-loop structures and has two upstream ATG codons. The predicted protein (Mr = 105,910) has no apparent membrane-spanning region and contains a single protein-tyrosine-phosphatase domain (amino acids 659-909) that is 35-40% identical to previously described tyrosine-phosphatase domains. The recombinant phosphatase domain possesses protein-tyrosine-phosphatase activity when expressed in Escherichia coli. The amino-terminal region (amino acids 31-367) is 45% identical to the amino terminus of human erythrocyte protein 4.1, a cytoskeletal protein. The identification of a protein-tyrosine-phosphatase that is related to cytoskeletal proteins implies that cell signaling activities reside not only in transmembrane receptors but in cytoskeletal elements as well.
We have isolated a full length cDNA (cDNA) coding for the human poly(A) binding protein. The cDNA derived 73 kd basic translation product has the same Mr, isoelectric point and peptidic map as the poly(A) binding protein. DNA sequence analysis reveals a 70,244 dalton protein. The N terminal part, highly homologous to the yeast poly(A) binding protein, is sufficient for poly(A) binding activity. This domain consists of a four-fold repeated unit of approximately 80 amino acids present in other nucleic acid binding proteins. In the C terminal part there is, as in the yeast protein, a sequence of approximately 150 amino acids, rich in proline, alanine and glutamine which together account for 48% of the residues. A 2,9 kb mRNA corresponding to this cDNA has been detected in several vertebrate cell types and in Drosophila melanogaster at every developmental stage including oogenesis.
We have isolated a human cDNA which encodes a novel I kappa B family member using a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins able to interact with the p52 subunit of the transcription factor NF-kappa B. The protein is found in many cell types and its expression is up-regulated following NF-kappa B activation and during myelopoiesis. Consistent with its proposed role as an I kappa B molecule, I kappa B-epsilon is able to inhibit NF-kappa B-directed transactivation via cytoplasmic retention of rel proteins. I kappa B-epsilon translation initiates from an internal ATG codon to give rise to a protein of 45 kDa, which exists as multiple phosphorylated isoforms in resting cells. Unlike the other inhibitors, it is found almost exclusively in complexes containing RelA and/or cRel. Upon activation, I kappa B-epsilon protein is degraded with slow kinetics by a proteasome-dependent mechanism. Similarly to I kappa B-alpha and I kappa B, I kappa B-epsilon contains multiple ankyrin repeats and two conserved serines which are necessary for signal-induced degradation of the molecule. A unique lysine residue located N-terminal of the serines appears to be not strictly required for degradation. Unlike I kappa B- alpha and I kappa B-beta, I kappa B-epsilon does not contain a C-terminal PEST-like sequence. I kappa B-epsilon would, therefore, appear to regulate a late, transient activation of a subset of genes, regulated by RelA/cRel NF-kappa B complexes, distinct from those regulated by other I kappa B proteins.
We have isolated a mouse cDNA of 5.7 kb, encoding a new member of the family of receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases, termed mRPTP mu. The cDNA predicts a protein of 1432 amino acids (not including signal peptide) with a calculated Mr of 161,636. In addition, we have cloned the human homologue, hRPTP mu, which shows 98.7% amino acid identity to mRPTP mu. The predicted mRPTP mu protein consists of a 722 amino acid extracellular region, containing 13 potential N-glycosylation sites, a single transmembrane domain and a 688 amino acid intracellular part containing 2 tandem repeats homologous to the catalytic domains of other tyrosine phosphatases. The N-terminal extracellular part contains a region of about 170 amino acids with no sequence similarities to known proteins, followed by one Ig-like domain and 4 fibronectin type III-like domains. The intracellular part is unique in that the region between the transmembrane domain and the first catalytic domain is about twice as large as in other receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases. RNA blot analysis reveals a single transcript, that is most abundant in lung and present in much lower amounts in brain and heart. Transfection of the mRPTP mu cDNA into COS cells results in the synthesis of a protein with an apparent Mr of 195,000, as detected in immunoblots using an antipeptide antibody. The human RPTP mu gene is localized on chromosome 18pter-q11, a region with frequent abnormalities implicated in human cancer.
We have isolated a novel human gene encoding a helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein by molecularly cloning chromosome 1p36-specific CpG islands. The gene termed heir-1 was localized to the neuroblastoma consensus deletion at 1p36.2-p36.12. Its predicted protein is 95.8% identical to the mouse HLH462 protein and has clear homology to the mouse Id and Drosophila emc proteins. Heir-1 does not encode a basic DNA binding domain as found in basic HLH proteins. The gene is expressed specifically at high abundance in adult lung, kidney and adrenal medulla, but not in adult brain. Despite prominent heir-1 expression in adrenal medulla, which is a prime target for neuroblastomas, 10 out of 12 neuroblastoma-derived cell lines revealed very low levels of heir-1 mRNA. Low heir-1 expression was generally found in tumor cell lines with N-myc overexpression, whereas the two cell lines displaying high heir-1 levels did not overexpress N-myc. Mutually exclusive expression of both genes was also found by in situ hybridization in developing mouse tissues, particularly in the forebrain neuroectoderm. We conclude that heir-1 expression is reduced specifically in the majority of neuroblastomas and suggest an inverse correlation between heir-1 and N-myc expression in neuroblastoma tumors and in embryonic development.
We have isolated and characterized a full-length cDNA clone encoding human loricrin. Curiously, this protein displays major differences from the recently described mouse loricrin (Mehrel, T., Hohl, D., Nakazawa, H., Rothnagel, J.A., Longley, M.A., Bundman, D., Cheng, C.K., Lichti, U., Bisher, M.E., Steven, A. C., Steinert, P.M., Yuspa, S.H., and Roop, D.R. (1990) Cell 61, 1103-1112). Although both proteins are glycine-serine-cysteine-rich, the sequences have not been conserved. However, analysis of the sequences reveals a common motif of quasi-peptide repeats of an aliphatic or aromatic amino acid residue followed by several glycine and/or serine and cysteine residues. These sequences are interspersed and flanked by short glutamine- or glutamine/lysine-rich peptides. Thus loricrins consist of a family of cell envelope proteins of highly variable sequences that nevertheless retain common structural elements. We show that unlike all other putative protein components of the cell envelope, loricrins are highly insoluble, due at least in part to cross-linking by disulfide bonds. Furthermore, we have isolated four peptides from purified human cell envelopes that contain recognizable loricrin sequences and which are cross-linked by the N epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine isodipeptide bond. The presence of such bonds thus affords an explanation for the extraordinary insolubility of loricrin by cross-linking to the cell envelope and can also explain the low steady-state levels of monomeric loricrin in cytoskeletal extracts of epidermis. This study represents the first report of this isodipeptide cross-link in a protein component of the cornified cell envelope. We propose a model for the structure of loricrin in which (i) the unusual glycine-serine-rich sequences adopt a flexible loop conformation, indexed on the recurrent aliphatic residues; (ii) inter- or intramolecular isodipeptide and disulfide cross-links induce or stabilize folding of loricrin so as to form a more compact rosette-like structure; and (iii) the presence of the flexible glycine-rich loops necessarily will impact a flexible character to the cell envelope and entire epithelium.
We have isolated and characterized a novel cDNA, C1q-Related Factor (CRF), that is predicted to encode a 258 amino acid polypeptide with a hydrophobic signal sequence, a collagenous region, and a globular domain at the carboxy terminus that shares homology to the C1q signature domain. Human CRF transcript is expressed at highest levels in the brain, particularly in the brainstem. In situ hybridization to mouse brain sections demonstrated that CRF transcripts are most abundant in areas of the nervous system involved in motor function, such as the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, the accessory olivary nucleus, the pons and the red nucleus. The mouse CRF homolog is highly similar to the human gene at both the nucleotide and protein level, suggesting an important conserved role for this protein. Copyright 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.
We have isolated and characterized a novel iron-regulated gene that is homologous to the divalent metal transporter 1 family of metal transporters. This gene, termed metal transporter protein (mtp1), is expressed in tissues involved in body iron homeostasis including the developing and mature reticuloendothelial system, the duodenum, and the pregnant uterus. MTP1 is also expressed in muscle and central nervous system cells in the embryo. At the subcellular level, MTP1 is localized to the basolateral membrane of the duodenal epithelial cell and a cytoplasmic compartment of reticuloendothelial system cells. Overexpression of MTP1 in tissue culture cells results in intracellular iron depletion. In the adult mouse, MTP1 expression in the liver and duodenum are reciprocally regulated. Iron deficiency induces MTP1 expression in the duodenum but down-regulates expression in the liver. These data indicate that MTP1 is an iron-regulated membrane-spanning protein that is involved in intracellular iron metabolism.
We have isolated the complete cDNA sequence encoding the human homolog of the yeast replication protein Cdc46/Mcm5. The cDNA was used as a probe for chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which localized the human Cdc46 gene (CDC46) to chromosome region 22q13.1-->q13.2. This is the fourth human Mcm gene whose chromosome region has been determined, and it is now apparent that human Mcm genes are widely distributed in the genome. As deduced from the cDNA sequence, human protein hCdc46 is composed of 734 amino acids and contains a central region that is almost 80% identical with the yeast protein. Immunoprecipitation experiments with hCdc46-specific antibodies confirm that essentially all nuclear hCdc46 proteins form a stable dimeric complex with protein P1Mcm3.
We have isolated the full-length cDNA of a novel human serine threonine protein kinase gene. The deduced protein sequence contains two cysteine-rich motifs at the N terminus, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a catalytic domain containing all the characteristic sequence motifs of serine protein kinases. It exhibits the strongest homology to the serine threonine protein kinases PKD/PKCmicro and PKCnu, particularly in the duplex zinc finger-like cysteine-rich motif, in the pleckstrin homology domain and in the protein kinase domain. In contrast, it shows only a low degree of sequence similarity to other members of the PKC family. Therefore, the new protein has been termed protein kinase D2 (PKD2). The mRNA of PKD2 is widely expressed in human and murine tissues. It encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 105 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which is expressed in various human cell lines, including HL60 cells, which do not express PKCmicro. In vivo phorbol ester binding studies demonstrated a concentration-dependent binding of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to PKD2. The addition of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate in the presence of dioleoylphosphatidylserine stimulated the autophosphorylation of PKD2 in a synergistic fashion. Phorbol esters also stimulated autophosphorylation of PKD2 in intact cells. PKD2 activated by phorbol esters efficiently phosphorylated the exogenous substrate histone H1. In addition, we could identify the C-terminal Ser(876) residue as an in vivo phosphorylation site within PKD2. Phosphorylation of Ser(876) of PKD2 correlated with the activation status of the kinase. Finally, gastrin was found to be a physiological activator of PKD2 in human AGS-B cells stably transfected with the CCK(B)/gastrin receptor. Thus, PKD2 is a novel phorbol ester- and growth factor-stimulated protein kinase.
We have isolated the full-length human 56 kDa selenium binding protein (hSP56) cDNA clone, which is the human homolog of mouse 56 kDa selenium binding protein. The cDNA is 1,668 bp long and has an open reading frame encoding 472 amino acids. The calculated molecular weight is 52.25 kDa and the estimated isoelectric point is 6.13. Using Northern blot hybridization, we found that this 56 kDa selenium binding protein is expressed in mouse heart with an intermediate level between those found in liver/lung/kidney and intestine. We have also successfully expressed hSP56 in Escherichia coli using the expression vector-pAED4. The hSP56 gene is located at human chromosome 1q21-22).
We have isolated the human GRAF gene (for GTPase regulator associated with the focal adhesion kinase pp125(FAK)). This gene was fused with MLL in a unique t(5;11)(q31;q23) that occurred in an infant with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. GRAF encodes a member of the Rho family of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family. On the protein level, it is 90% homologous to the recently described chicken GRAF gene that functions as a GAP of RhoA in vivo and is thus a critical component of the integrin signaling transduction pathway. The particular position of the human GRAF gene at 5q31 and the proposed antiproliferative and tumor suppressor properties of its avian homologue suggest that it also might be pathogenetically relevant for hematologic malignancies with deletions of 5q. To investigate this possibility, we sequenced 4-5 individual cDNA clones from 13 cases in which one allele of GRAF was deleted. We found point mutations within the GAP domain of the second GRAF allele in one patient. In two additional patients we found an insertion of 52 or 74 bp within the GRAF cDNA that generates a reading frame shift followed by a premature stop codon. GRAF maps outside the previously defined commonly deleted 5q31 region. Nevertheless, inactivation of both alleles in at least some cases suggests that deletions and mutations of the GRAF gene may be instrumental in the development and progression of hematopoeitic disorders with a del(5q).
We have isolated, by degenerate PCR, a complementary DNA encoding a novel two pore domain potassium channel. This is the 7th functional member of the human tandem pore domain potassium channel family to be reported. It has an open reading frame of 1.125 kb and encodes a 374 amino acid protein which shows 62% identity to the human TASK-1 gene: identity to other human members of the family is 31-35% at the amino acid level. We believe this gene to be human TASK-3, the ortholog of the recently reported rat TASK-3 gene: amino acid identity between the two is 74%. 'Taqman' mRNA analysis demonstrated a very specific tissue distribution pattern, showing human TASK-3 mRNA to be localised largely in the cerebellum, in contrast rat TASK-3 was reported to be widely distributed. We have shown by radiation hybrid mapping that human TASK-3 can be assigned to chromosome 8q24.3. Human TASK-3 was demonstrated to endow Xenopus oocytes with a negative resting membrane potential through the presence of a large K(+) selective conductance. TASK-3 is inhibited by extracellular acidosis with a mid-point of inhibition around pH 6. 5, supporting the predictions from the sequence data that this is a third human TASK (TWIK-related acid sensitive K(+) channel) gene.
We have observed over 25 different mutations in the diastrophic dysplasia sulphate transporter gene (DTDST) in association with the recessive disorders achondrogenesis 1B, atelosteogenesis 2, and diastrophic dysplasia. The c862t (R279W) transition is the most common mutation in non-Finnish patients, but in these disorders it is usually combined with other DTDST mutations. We had not seen a case of homozygosity for c862t (R279W) until we analysed DNA from a 36 year old male with tall-normal stature (180 cm) who asked for genetic counselling for suspected multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. He was treated for club foot and hip dysplasia at birth. Skeletal changes consistent with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, with the peculiar finding of a double layered patella, were recognised during childhood. Cleft palate, swelling of the ear pinna, and hitch hiker thumb were absent. He was found to be homozygous, and both healthy parents heterozygous, for the R279W mutation in DTDST, and his fibroblasts showed a sulphate incorporation defect typical of DTDST disorders. Counselling was given for a recessive disorder, thereby considerably reducing the probability of affected offspring. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is more frequently caused by dominant mutations in the COMP (EDM1, McKusick 132400) and COL9A2 genes (EDM2, McKusick 600204). A few other patients and families with features similar to our proband have been described previously and considered to have autosomal recessive MED (EDM4, McKusick 226900). This observation confirms the existence of this entity and assigns it to the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations at the DTDST locus..
We have performed differential screening of a human metastatic lymph lymph node cDNA library to identify genes possibly involved during breast cancer progression. We have identified four novel genes overexpressed in malignant tiddues. They were all located on the long arm of chromosome 17, in loci located between q11 and q21.3, a region known to contain the c-erbB-2 oncogene and the BRCA1 breast carcinomas, and overexpression of three of them was dependent on gene amplification in breast cancer cell lines. These findings further support the concept that human chromosome 17 specifically carries genes possibly involved in breast cancer progression.
We have performed linkage analysis with the DNA markers DXS52 and the clotting factor VIII gene (F8C), in several large families with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). The tight linkage to DXS52 could be extended giving a maximal LOD score of 22. 5 at 1 cM. F8C was also tightly linked to ALD with a maximal LOD score of 7. 8 without recombination. Multipoint linkage analysis with the markers DXS304, DXS52, and F8C indicated that both the gene for ALD and for F8C are distal to DXS52. In four patients with ALD, no major structural rearrangement in the Xqter region was observed; in particular, there were no abnormalities in the vision blindness genes. DNA analysis appeared to be of use in determination of the carrier status of females at risk, for the determination of the origin of the mutation in a particular family, and for prenatal diagnosis.
We have previously assigned the Friedreich ataxia locus (FRDA) to chromosome 9; the current maximal lod score between FRDA and MCT112 (D9S15) is greater than 50 at a recombination fraction of theta = 0. The physical assignment of the locus defined by MCT112, and hence FRDA, has not been determined, although linkage analysis of MCT112 with other chromosome 9 markers inferred a location close to the centromere. We have used in situ hybridisation with MCT112, a corresponding cosmid MJ1, and DR47 (D9S5), coupled with mapping studies on hybrid cell panels, to define more precisely the location of the disease locus. The in situ location of all three probes is 9q13----q21. 1, distal to the variable heterochromatin region. Physical assignment of FRDA will allow us to identify hybrid cell lines containing the mutated gene.
We have previously cloned and characterized the murine homologue of the Huntington disease (HD) gene and shown that it maps to mouse chromosome 5 within a region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 4p16. 3 3. Here we present a detailed comparison of the sequence of the putative promoter and the organization of the 5 genomic region of the murine (Hdh) and human HD genes encompassing the first five exons. We show that in this region these two genes share identical exon boundaries, but have different-size introns. Two dinucleotide (CT) and one trinucleotide intronic polymorphism in Hdh and an intronic CA polymorphism in the HD gene were identified. Comparison of 940-bp sequence 5 to the putative translation start site reveals a highly conserved region (78. 8% nucleotide identity) between Hdh and the HD gene from nucleotide -56 to -206 (of Hdh). Neither Hdh nor the HD gene have typical TATA or CCAAT elements, but both show one putative AP2 binding site and numerous potential Sp1 binding sites. The high sequence identity between Hdh and the HD gene for approximately 200 bp 5 to the putative translation start site indicates that these sequences may play a role in regulating expression of the Huntington disease gene
We have previously described a disorder, normotriglyceridemic abetalipoproteinemia, that is characterized by the virtual absence of plasma low density lipoproteins and complete absence of apoB-100, but with apparently normal secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins containing apoB-48. The patients plasma lipoproteins were shown on polyacrylamide gels and by antibody mapping to have a new truncated apoB variant, apoB-50, circulating along with her apoB-48. We have found this individual to be homozygous for a single C-to-T nucleotide substitution at apoB codon 2252, which produces a premature in-frame stop codon. Thus, this is a rare example of homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia. Electron photomicrographs revealed that the diameters of particles in the d less than 1. 006 g/ml lipoprotein fraction, in both the postprandial and postabsorptive state, are bimodally distributed. The molar ratio of apoE to apoB in these particles is 3. 5 1, similar to normal VLDL. The plasma LDL interval contains both spherical and cuboidal particles. Autologous reinfusion of labeled d less than 1. 006 g/ml lipoproteins showed exponential disappearance from plasma, with an apparent half-removal time of 50 min, somewhat slower than for normal chylomicrons but within the normal range for VLDL. The calculated production rate for apoB was within the normal range in this subject.
We have previously identified a partial cDNA fragment obtained from rat carotid arteries subject to balloon angioplasty which is increased in response to vascular injury. We now report the isolation and characterization of a full length human clone which is 98% homologous at the amino acid level to the rat. Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1 (AIF-1), a gene previously reported to be expressed in rat IFN gamma-activated macrophages. This transcript is expressed in low levels in undamaged, and increases 1 day and 3 days, and declines 7 days post balloon angioplasty. This human AIF-1 homologue is inducible in serum and cytokine-stimulated human smooth muscle cells. Interestingly, human tissue distribution indicates a constitutive expression in lymphoid tissue which can be augmented by mitogens. In summary, human AIF represents a cytokine inducible, tissue-specific, and highly conserved transcript transiently expressed in response to vascular trauma.
We have previously reported a robust association between an allelic haplotype of 'Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1' (DISC1) and schizophrenia in a nationwide collection of Finnish schizophrenia families. This specific DISC1 allele was later identified to associate with visual working memory, selectively in males. DISC1 association to schizophrenia has since been replicated in multiple independent study samples from different populations. In this study, we conditioned our sample of Finnish families for the presence of the Finnish tentative risk allele for DISC1 and re-analyzed our genome-wide scan data of 443 markers on the basis of this stratification. Two additional loci displayed an evidence of linkage (LOD > 3) and included a locus on 16p13, proximal to the gene encoding NDE1, which has been shown to biologically interact with DISC1. Although none of the observed linkages remained significant after multiple test correction through simulation, further analysis of NDE1 revealed an association between a tag-haplotype and schizophrenia (P = 0.00046) specific to females, which proved to be significant (P = 0.011) after multiple test correction. Our finding would support the concept that initial gene findings in multifactorial diseases will assist in the identification of other components of complex genetic etiology. Notably, this and other converging lines of evidence underline the importance of DISC1-related functional pathways in the etiology of schizophrenia.
We have previously reported the identification of a novel cDNA, SM-20, whose corresponding mRNA levels are regulated by growth factors in rat aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) culture. Affinity-purified polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were made against a 230 amino acid region of the SM-20 putative peptide expressed in the bacterial vector, pET-3b. Western blot analyses of rat and human SMC lysates detected a single protein species of approximately 40 kd. SM-20 was not detected in concentrates of the culture medium. By immunohistochemistry, SM-20 was localized to filaments in the cytoplasm of cultured SMC. Like SM-20 mRNA, levels of SM-20 protein were increased 1-3 hours after serum stimulation of rat aortic SMC. In rat tissues, SM-20 antigen was detected in abundance in smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscle. SM-20 was also detected in some epithelial cells of the kidney, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, but was not found in the parenchyma of the liver, spleen, or testis. In the rat arterial wall, SM-20 antigen was restricted to the SMC of the media and, after balloon arterial injury, was found most abundantly in the neointima. In human atherosclerotic coronary arteries, SM-20 antigen predominated in the SMC of the intimal plaques and was not detected in macrophages, endothelium, or adventitial cells. Thus, SM-20 encodes a protein which serves as a novel SMC-specific marker within the vessel wall.
We have previously shown that a permanent deficiency in the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may increase the sensitivity of the baroreflex control of heart rate. In this study we aimed at studying the involvement of the brain RAS in the cardiac reactivity to the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) agonist isoproterenol (Iso). Transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen (TGR) were used. In isolated hearts, Iso induced a significantly greater increase in left ventricular (LV) pressure and maximal contraction (+dP/dt(max)) in the TGR than in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. LV hypertrophy induced by Iso treatment was significantly higher in TGR than in SD rats (in g LV wt/100 g body wt, 0.28 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.004, respectively). The greater LV hypertrophy in TGR rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta-AR and upregulation of LV beta-AR kinase-1 mRNA levels compared with those in SD rats. The decrease in the heart rate (HR) induced by the beta-AR antagonist metoprolol in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in TGR compared with SD rats (-9.9 +/- 1.7% vs. -18.1 +/- 1.5%), whereas the effect of parasympathetic blockade by atropine on HR was similar in both strains. These results indicate that TGR are more sensitive to beta-AR agonist-induced cardiac inotropic response and hypertrophy, possibly due to chronically low sympathetic outflow directed to the heart.
We have previously shown that human piebaldism results from mutations of the KIT gene, which encodes the receptor for the mast/stem cell growth factor and is located in chromosome segment 4q12. Using DNA of a patient with piebaldism, mental retardation, and multiple congenital anomalies associated with a 46, XY, del (4) (q12q21. 1) karyotype, we carried out quantitative Southern blot hybridization analyses of the KIT gene and the adjacent PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha subunit) genes. The patient was hemizygous for both the KIT and PDGFRA genes, indicating that both of these genes are included within the deleted region. Therefore, deletion of the KIT and PDGFRA genes may account for the piebald phenotype in this patient.
We have re-examined an extended myotonic dystrophy (DM) family, previously described in 1955, in order to study the long term effects of anticipation in DM and in particular the implications for families affected by this disease. This follow up study provides data on 35 gene carriers and 46 asymptomatic at risk family members in five generations. Clinical anticipation, defined as the cascade of mild, adult, childhood, or congenital disease in subsequent generations, appeared to be a relentless process, occurring in all affected branches of the family. The cascade was found to proceed asynchronously in the different branches, mainly because of an unequal number of generations with mild disease. The transition from the mild to the adult type was associated with transmission through a male parent. Stable transmission of the asymptomatic/mild phenotype showed a female transmission bias. We further examined the extent and causes of gene loss in this pedigree. Gene loss in the patient group was complete, owing to infertility of the male patients with adult onset disease and the fact that mentally retarded patients did not procreate. Out of the 46 at risk subjects in the two youngest generations, only one was found to have a full mutation. This is the only subject who may transmit the gene to the sixth generation. No protomutation carriers were found in the fourth and fifth generations. Therefore it is highly probable that the DM gene will be eliminated from this pedigree within one generation. The high population frequency of DM can at present not be explained by the contribution of asymptomatic cases in the younger generations of known families, but is probably caused by the events in the ancestral generations..
We have recently demonstrated that disruption of extracellular matrix (ECM)/integrin signaling via elimination of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in hepatocytes interferes with signals leading to termination of liver regeneration. This study investigates the role of ILK in liver enlargement induced by phenobarbital (PB). Wild-type (WT) and ILK:liver-/- mice were given PB (0.1% in drinking water) for 10 days. Livers were harvested on 2, 5, and 10 days during PB administration. In the hepatocyte-specific ILK/liver-/- mice, the liver:body weight ratio was more than double as compared to 0 h at day 2 (2.5 times), while at days 5 and 10, it was enlarged three times. In the WT mice, the increase was as expected from previous literature (1.8 times) and seems to have leveled off after day 2. There were slightly increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells in the ILK/liver-/- animals at day 2 as compared to WT after PB administration. In the WT animals, the proliferative response had come back to normal by days 5 and 10. Hepatocytes of the ILK/liver-/- mice continued to proliferate up until day 10. ILK/liver-/- mice also showed increased expression of key genes involved in hepatocyte proliferation at different time points during PB administration. In summary, ECM proteins communicate with the signaling machinery of dividing cells via ILK to regulate hepatocyte proliferation and termination of the proliferative response. Lack of ILK in the hepatocytes imparts prolonged proliferative response not only to stimuli related to liver regeneration but also to xenobiotic chemical mitogens, such as PB.
We have recently reported the molecular characterization of a novel murine receptor PTK (myk-1), belonging to the eph-related family, whose expression was differentially regulated during mammary gland development and elevated in invasive mouse mammary tumours. In this communication we have investigated the cellular origin of myk-1 expression by in situ hybridisation and RNase protection. Murine antisense myk-1 probe specifically recognised ductal and alveolar epithelium in the resting mouse mammary gland. In normal human breast, the expression of htk, the human homologue, was also confined to the secretory luminal epithelial cells. RNase protection analysis of enriched luminal and myoepithelial cells prepared from human reduction mammoplasty tissue confirmed the luminal specificity. Elevated expression of htk was found in several human breast carcinoma cell lines as well as in primary, high grade, infiltrating, ductal carcinomas of the breast. The specific epithelial expression of the myk-1/htk receptor PTK suggest a specialised role of this eph-related PTK in the differentiation and/or maintenance of secretory epithelium in the adult.
We have recently shown that estrogen negatively modulates the hypotensive effect of clonidine (mixed alpha2-/I1-receptor agonist) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction. The present study investigated whether this effect of estrogen involves interaction with alpha2- and/or I1-receptors. Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of rilmenidine (600 microg/kg) or alpha-methyldopa (100 mg/kg), selective I1- and alpha2-receptor agonists, respectively, in blood pressure, hemodynamic variability, and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham-operated and ovariectomized (Ovx) Sprague-Dawley female rats with or without 12-wk estrogen replacement. Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed: the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals (SDRR) and the root mean square of successive differences in R-wave-to-R-wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability. In sham-operated rats, rilmenidine or alpha-methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure. SDRR was reduced only by alpha-methyldopa. Ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha-methyldopa, in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension. The enhanced alpha-methyldopa hypotension in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and a reduced locomotor activity. Estrogen replacement (17beta-estradiol subcutaneous pellet, 14.2 microg/day, 12 wk) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of alpha-methyldopa to sham-operated levels. These findings suggest that estrogen downregulates alpha2- but not I1-receptor-mediated hypotension and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in alpha-methyldopa-estrogen interaction.
We have reported a case of acute oliguric renal failure with hyperkalemia in a patient with cirrhosis, ascites, and cor pulmonale after indomethacin therapy. Prompt restoration of renal function followed drug withdrawal, while re-exposure to a single dose of indomethacin caused recurrence of acute reversible oliguria. Our case supports the hypothesis that endogenous renal prostaglandins play a role in the maintenance of renal blood flow when circulating plasma volume is diminished. Since nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents interfere with this compensatory mechanism and may cause acute renal failure, they should be used with caution in such patients.
We have retrospectively analyzed 837 random anonymized dried blood spot (DBS) samples from neonatal screening programs in Scandinavia for mutations in HFE, the candidate gene for hemochromatosis. We have found C282Y allele frequencies of 2. 3% (+ 2. 0%) (-1. 3%) in Greenland, 4. 5% +/-1. 9% in Iceland, 5. 1% +/-2. 3% in the Faeroe Islands, and 8. 2% +/-2. 7% in Denmark. The high prevalence of HFE mutations in Denmark suggests that population screening for the C282Y mutation could be highly advantageous in terms of preventive health care. Long-term follow-up evaluation of C282Y homozygotes and H63D/C282Y compound heterozygotes will give an indication of the penetrance of the mutations.
We have searched for germ-line RB1 mutations in 119 patients with hereditary retinoblastoma. Previous investigations by Southern blot hybridization and PCR fragment-length analysis had revealed mutations in 48 patients. Here we report on the analysis of the remaining 71 patients. By applying heteroduplex analysis, nonisotopic SSCP, and direct sequencing, we detected germ-line mutations resulting in premature termination codons or disruption of splice signals in 51 (72%) of the 71 patients. Four patients also showed rare sequence variants. No region of the RB1 gene was preferentially involved in single base substitutions. Recurrent transitions were observed at most of the 14 codons within the RB1. No mutation was observed in exons 25-27, although this region contains two CGA codons. This suggests that mutations within the 3-terminal region of the RB1 gene may not be oncogenic. When these data were combined with the results of our previous investigations, mutations were identified in a total of 99 (83%) of 119 patients. The spectrum comprises 15% large deletions, 26% small length alterations, and 42% base substitutions. No correlation between the location of frameshift or nonsense mutations and phenotypic features, including age at diagnosis, the number of tumor foci, and manifestation of nonocular tumors was observed..
We have searched for mutations in the choroideremia gene (CHM) in patients from 12 Danish families in which CHM is segregating. Employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, and direct DNA sequencing, different mutations have been identified in 6 patients. All the mutations will interfere with the correct translation of the mRNA predicting a truncated protein or no gene product at all..
We have studied genetic linkage between the gene for creatine kinase muscle type (CKMM) and the gene for myotonic dystrophy (DM). In a panel of 65 myotonic dystrophy families from Canada and the Netherlands, a maximum lod score (Zmax) of 22. 8 at a recombination frequency (theta) of 0. 03 was obtained. Tight linkage was also demonstrated for CKMM and the gene for apolipoprotein C2 (ApoC2). This establishes CKMM as a useful marker for myotonic dystrophy
We have studied the genetic linkage of two markers, the apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1) gene and a cytochrome P450 (CYP2A) gene, in relation to the gene for myotonic dystrophy (DM). A peak lod score of 9. 29 at 2 cM was observed for APOC1-DM, with a lod score of 8. 55 at 4 cM for CYP2A-DM. These two markers also show close linkage to each other (theta max = 0. 05, Zmax = 9. 09). From examination of the genotypes of the recombinant individuals, CYP2A appears to map proximal to DM because in one recombinant individual CYP2A, APOC2 and CKMM had all recombined with DM. Evidence from another CYP2A-DM recombinant individual places CYP2A proximal to APOC2 and CKMM. Localisation of CYP2A on a panel of somatic cell hybrids also suggests that it is proximal to DM and APOC2/C1/E gene cluster.
We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes induced by the execution of a finger-to-thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of parkinsonian patients on L-dopa medication, the first one without L-dopa induced dyskinesia (n = 23) and the other with moderate peak-dose dyskinesia (n = 15), and of a group of 14 normal subjects. Single photon emission tomography with i.v. 133Xe was used to measure the rCBF changes. The dyskinetic parkinsonian patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non-dyskinetic parkinsonian patients, with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi- and contralateral primary motor areas. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement, like L-dopa-induced peak dose dyskinesia, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop.
We have undertaken a hospital-based study, to identify possible BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations in the Polish population. The study group consisted of 66 Polish families with cancer who have at least three related females affected with breast or ovarian cancer and who had cancer diagnosed, in at least one of the three affected females, at age < 50 years. A total of 26 families had both breast and ovarian cancers, 4 families had ovarian cancers only, and 36 families had breast cancers only. Genomic DNA was prepared from the peripheral blood leukocytes of at least one affected woman from each family. The entire coding region of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was screened for the presence of germline mutations, by use of SSCP followed by direct sequencing of observed variants. Mutations were found in 35 (53%) of the 66 families studied. All but one of the mutations were detected within the BRCA1 gene. BRCA1 abnormalities were identified in all four families with ovarian cancer only, in 67% of 27 families with both breast and ovarian cancer, and in 34% of 35 families with breast cancer only. The single family with a BRCA2 mutation had the breast-ovarian cancer syndrome. Seven distinct mutations were identified; five of these occurred in two or more families. In total, recurrent mutations were found in 33 (94%) of the 35 families with detected mutations. Three BRCA1 abnormalities - 5382insC, C61G, and 4153delA - accounted for 51%, 20%, and 11% of the identified mutations, respectively..
We have used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to perform precise chromosomal mapping of the genes encoding the transcription factors c-rel, NF-kappa Bp50, NF-kappa Bp65, and lyt-10. The previously published assignments of c-rel and NF-kappa Bp50 have been refined to specific bands. The map position of lyt-10, inferred from its isolation from a t(10;14)(q24;q32) translocation, has been confirmed. NF-kappa Bp65 has now been mapped to 11q13, a site of frequent involvement in aberration in multiple tumor types.
We have used single strand conformation polymorphism analysis to study the 27 exons of the RB1 gene in individuals from a family showing mild expression of the retinoblastoma phenotype. In this family affected individuals developed unilateral tumors and, as a result of linkage analysis, unaffected mutation carriers were also identified within the pedigree. A single band shift using SSCP was identified in exon 21 which resulted in a missense mutation converting a cys-- > arg at nucleotide position 28 in the exon. The mutation destroyed an NdeI restriction enzyme site. Analysis of all family members demonstrated that the missense mutation co-segregated with patients with tumors or who, as a result of linkage analysis had been predicted to carry the predisposing mutation. These observations point to another region of the RB1 gene where mutations only modify the function of the gene and raise important questions for genetic counseling in families with these distinctive phenotypes..
We here report 20 novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms in four genes that are potentially involved in the excitement of cardiomyocytes: 1 in KCNA5 (encoding Kv1.5), 5 in KCNAB1 (encoding Kvbeta1.3), 5 in KCNIP2 (encoding KChIP2), and 9 in CACNA1C (encoding a cardiac L-type voltage-dependent calcium ion channel, dihydropyridine receptor). We also examined their allelic frequencies in Japanese individuals. These data will be useful for genetic association studies designed to investigate secondary long QT syndrome or other circulatory disorders.
We herein describe the case of an 81-year-old Japanese woman with neuroleptic malignant syndrome that occurred 36 days after the initiation of combination therapy with tiapride (75 mg/day) and tetrabenazine (12.5 mg/day) for Huntington's disease. The patient had been treated with tiapride or tetrabenazine alone without any adverse effects before the administration of the combination therapy. She also had advanced breast cancer when the combination therapy was initiated. To the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to combination therapy with tetrabenazine and tiapride has not been previously reported. Tetrabenazine should be administered very carefully in combination with other neuroleptic drugs, particularly in patients with a worsening general condition.
We hypothesized that the genomic response to folate deficiency might be different between breast cancer cases and healthy subjects. To test this hypothesis, we performed a comprehensive study on the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of in vitro folic acid (FA) deficiency on primary human lymphocytes from 19 breast cancer patients and 20 age-matched healthy females from Yunnan, China using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. Lymphocytes from the volunteers were cultured in RPMI1640 medium containing 30, 120 or 240 nM FA for 9 days. The results showed that 30 nM FA was associated with increased frequencies of micronucleated binucleated cell (MNed BNC), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB), nuclear buds (BUD), apoptosis (APO) and necrosis (NEC) relative to 120 and 240 nM FA (P<0.001) in lymphocytes of case and control groups in vitro, however there were no significant differences between the 120 and 240 nM FA within each sampling group. The case group showed significantly higher frequencies of MNed BNC than control at 120 and 240 nM FA (P<0.05-0.001) but not at 30 nM FA (P=0.052). NEC was significantly higher in breast cancer group than control at all concentrations of FA (P<0.005). FA concentration explained 60, 39, 39, 52 and 71% of the variance of MNed BNC, NPB, BUD, APO and NEC, respectively compared with breast cancer status which only explained 6 and 7% of the variance of MNed BNC and NEC(Two way ANOVA, P<0.0001). Difference of difference analysis showed that breast cancer cases were not abnormally sensitive to the genome-damaging effect of folate deficiency. We concluded that (i) increased concentrations of FA abolished the genome-damaging effect of FA deficiency in lymphocytes of both breast cancer patients and controls to a similar extent and (ii) FA concentration is much more important than breast cancer status in determining genomic instability and cell death.
We identified a novel gene family in vertebrates which is preferentially expressed in developing and adult striated muscle. Three genes of the Popeye (POP) family were detected in human and mouse and two in chicken. Chromosomal mapping indicates that Pop1 and Pop3 genes are clustered on mouse chromosome 10, whereas Pop2 maps to mouse chromosome 16. We found evidence that POP1 and POP3 in chicken may also be linked and multiple transcript isoforms are generated from this locus. The POP genes encode proteins with three potential transmembrane domains that are conserved in all family members. Individual POP genes exhibit specific expression patterns during development and postnatally. Chicken POP3 and mouse Pop1 are first preferentially expressed in atrium and later also in the subepicardial compact layer of the ventricles. Chicken POP1 and mouse Pop2 are expressed in the entire heart except the outflow tract. All three Pop genes are expressed in heart and skeletal muscle of the adult mouse and lower in lung. Pop1 and Pop2 expression is upregulated in uterus of pregnant mice. Like the mouse genes, human POP genes are predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The strong conservation of POP genes during evolution and their preferential expression in heart and skeletal muscle suggest that these novel proteins may have an important function in these tissues in vertebrates.

We identified a patient suffering from late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) who has a residual arylsulfatase A (ARSA) activity of about 10%. Fibroblasts of the patient show significant sulfatide degradation activity exceeding that of adult MLD patients. Analysis of the ARSA gene in this patient revealed heterozygosity for two new mutant alleles in one allele, deletion of C 447 in exon 2 leads to a frameshift and to a premature stop codon at amino acid position 105; in the second allele, a G-- > A transition in exon 5 causes a Gly309-- > Ser substitution. Transient expression of the mutant Ser309-ARSA resulted in only 13% enzyme activity of that observed in cells expressing normal ARSA. The mutant ARSA is correctly targeted to the lysosomes but is unstable. These findings are in contrast to previous results showing that the late-infantile type of MLD is always associated with the complete absence of ARSA activity. The expression of the mutant ARSA protein may be influenced by particular features of oligodendrocytes, such that the level of mutant enzyme is lower in these cells than in others..
We identified four proteins in nuclear extracts from HeLa cells which specifically bind to a scaffold attachment region (SAR) element from the human genome. Of these four proteins, SAF-A (scaffold attachment factor A), shows the highest affinity for several homologous and heterologous SAR elements from vertebrate cells. SAF-A is an abundant nuclear protein and a constituent of the nuclear matrix and scaffold. The homogeneously purified protein is a novel double stranded DNA binding protein with an apparent molecular weight of 120 kDa. SAF-A binds at multiple sites to the human SAR element; competition studies with synthetic polynucleotides indicate that these sites most probably reside in the multitude of A/T-stretches which are distributed throughout this element. In addition we show by electron microscopy that the protein forms large aggregates and mediates the formation of looped DNA structures.
We identified the alpha-cardiac actin gene (ACTC) as a novel disease gene in a pedigree suffering from familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). Linkage analyses excluded all the previously reported FHC loci as possible disease loci in the family studied, with lod scores varying between -2. 5 and -6. 0 0. Further linkage analyses of plausible candidate genes highly expressed in the adult human heart identified ACTC as the most likely disease gene, showing a maximal lod score of 3. 6 6. Mutation analysis of ACTC revealed an Ala295Ser mutation in exon 5 close to 2 missense mutations recently described to cause the inherited form of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).
We investigated clinical and cellular phenotypes of 24 children with mutations in the catalytic (alpha) subunit of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gamma polymerase (POLG1). Twenty-one had Alpers syndrome, the commonest severe POLG1 autosomal recessive phenotype, comprising hepatoencephalopathy and often mtDNA depletion. The cellular mtDNA content reflected the genotype more closely than did clinical features. Patients with tissue depletion of mtDNA all had at least one allele with either a missense mutation in a catalytic domain or a nonsense mutation. Four out of 12 patients exhibited a progressive, mosaic pattern of mtDNA depletion in cultured fibroblasts. All these patients had mutations in a catalytic domain in both POLG1 alleles, in either the polymerase or exonuclease domain or both. The tissue mtDNA content of patients who had two linker mutations was normal, and their phenotypes the mildest. Epilepsy and/or movement disorder were major features in all 21. Previous studies have implicated replication stalling as a mechanism for mtDNA depletion. The mosaic cellular depletion that we have demonstrated in cell cultures may be a manifestation of severe replication stalling. One patient with a severe cellular and clinical phenotype was a compound heterozygote with POLG1 mutations in the polymerase and exonuclease domain intrans. This suggests that POLG1 requires both polymerase and 3'-5' exonuclease activity in the same molecule. This is consistent with current functional models for eukaryotic DNA polymerases, which alternate between polymerizing and editing modes, as determined by competition between these two active sites for the 3' end of the DNA.
We investigated the effect of repeated treatment with fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, on behavioral effects of dopaminomimetics and methoxamine and on the animal behavior in the "behavioral despair" test. A repeated treatment with fluvoxamine (twice daily for 14 days) potentiated in mice and in rats (weaker) the amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. The hyperactivity induced by nomifensine in mice remained unaffected by fluvoxamine. The stimulation of locomotor activity by intracerebroventricularly administered methoxamine was not affected by repeated treatment with fluvoxamine. Given three times fluvoxamine had no effect on the immobilization time in the "behavioral despair" test in rats. The results indicate that fluvoxamine given repeatedly acts differently than citalopram, another selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, and differs also from other antidepressant drugs.
We investigated the effects of antithrombin, a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors, in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis, which is an experimental model of human nephrotic syndrome. Antithrombin (50 or 500 IU/kg/i.v.) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (50 mg/kg/i.v.). Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced hematological abnormalities. Puromycin aminonucleoside-induced renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also suppressed. Histopathological examination revealed severe renal damage such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats, while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin-treated rats. In addition, antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed puromycin aminonucleoside-induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells. Furthermore, puromycin aminonucleoside-induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased. These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome. Treatment with antithrombin may be clinically effective in patients with nephrotic syndrome.
We investigated the effects of clentiazem, a 1,5-benzothiazepine calcium antagonist, on epinephrine-induced cardiomyopathy in rats. With 2-week chronic epinephrine infusion, 16 of 30 rats died within 4 days, and severe ischemic lesions and fibrosis of the left ventricles were observed. In epinephrine-treated rats, left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to isoproterenol were reduced, but responses to calcium were normal or enhanced compared to controls. Left ventricular alpha and beta adrenoceptor densities were also reduced compared to controls. Treatment with clentiazem prevented epinephrine-induced death (P < .05), and attenuated the ventricular ischemic lesions and fibrosis, in a dose-dependent manner. Left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to isoproterenol were reduced compared to controls in groups treated with clentiazem alone, but combined with epinephrine, clentiazem restored left atrial responses and enhanced left ventricular papillary responses to isoproterenol. On the other hand clentiazem did not prevent epinephrine-induced down-regulation of alpha and beta adrenoceptors. Interestingly, clentiazem, infused alone, resulted in decreased adrenergic receptor densities in the left ventricle. Clentiazem also did not prevent the enhanced responses to calcium seen in the epinephrine-treated animals, although the high dose of clentiazem partially attenuated the maximal response to calcium compared to epinephrine-treated animals. In conclusion, clentiazem attenuated epinephrine-induced cardiac injury, possibly through its effect on the adrenergic pathway.
We investigated the influence of SLCO1B1 polymorphism on cholesterol synthesis and absorption during baseline, and as affected by statins. In a crossover study, 32 healthy volunteers with different SLCO1B1 genotypes ingested a single dose of fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, and atorvastatin. Plasma total cholesterol, and cholesterol synthesis and absorption markers were measured before statin administration and up to 12 h thereafter. The mean fasting baseline plasma desmosterol to cholesterol ratio was 40% higher in participants with the SLCO1B1 c.521CC variant genotype than in those with the c.521TT genotype (P=0.043). The genotype had no significant effect on cholesterol absorption markers. All statins decreased lathosterol and avenasterol to cholesterol ratios, but no significant differences in the response existed between SLCO1B1 genotypes. In conclusion, the low activity SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype is associated with an increased cholesterol synthesis rate. The short-term effects of statins on cholesterol homeostasis were not associated with the SLCO1B1 polymorphism.
We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors after neuraxial morphine following a noninjurious interval of aortic occlusion in rats. Spinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 min with a balloon catheter. In a microdialysis study, 10 muL of saline (group C; n = 8) or 30 mug of morphine (group M; n = 8) was injected intrathecally (IT) 0.5 h after reflow, and 30 mug of morphine (group SM; n = 8) or 10 muL of saline (group SC; n = 8) was injected IT 0.5 h after sham operation. Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia, before IT injection, and at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h of reperfusion (after IT injection). Second, we investigated the effect of IT MK-801 (30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis. After IT morphine, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C (P < 0.05). This increase persisted for 8 hrs. IT MK-801 significantly reduced the number of dark-stained alpha-motoneurons after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group. These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF glutamate, which is involved in NMDA receptor activation. We suggest that opioids may be neurotoxic in the setting of spinal cord ischemia via NMDA receptor activation.
We isolated a cDNA clone which shows a significant similarity with the renal Na+/phosphate cotransporter (NPT) from a human intestine mucosa cDNA library. The cDNA is 2626 bases long, with one open reading frame encoding a protein of 497 amino acids. The deduced amino acids sequence shows an overall homology of 48% with the human renal NPT1 protein. This gene is expressed in intestine, colon, liver, and pancreas. Thus, this gene may code for intestinal type NPT or closely related proteins. The chromosomal location of the gene was determined on the chromosome 6p21.3-p22 region by polymerase chain reaction-based analysis with both a human/rodent mono-chromosomal hybrid cell panel and a radiation hybrid mapping panel.
We isolated cDNA coding for the ninth of the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-T9) from human brain by the polymerase chain reaction. The polypeptide encoded by GalNAc-T9 contained the structural features characteristic of GalNAc transferases, such as a GT1 motif, a Gal/GalNAc transferase motif, (QXW)(3) repeats, and conserved His, Cys, and acidic amino acid residues. Northern blot analysis revealed the mRNA expression of the enzyme to be confined to the brain. The brain-specific expression of GalNAc-T9 suggested that this isozyme catalyzes O-glycosylation in the brain.
We isolated cDNA encoding a novel fibroblast growth factor (FGF-22) (170 amino acids) from human placenta. Of the FGF family members, FGF-22, which appears to be a secreted protein, is most similar to FGF-10 and FGF-7 (approximately 46% and approximately 40% amino acid identities, respectively). The human FGF-22 gene was localized on chromosome 19p13.3. We also isolated mouse cDNA encoding FGF-22 (162 amino acids) from the skin. Mouse FGF-22 shows high homology (87% amino acid identity) to human FGF-22. Mouse FGF-22 mRNA was found to be preferentially expressed in the skin among the mouse adult tissues examined by Northern blotting analysis. By in situ hybridization, FGF-22 mRNA in the skin was found to be preferentially expressed in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle. Therefore, FGF-22 is expected to be a unique FGF that plays a role in hair development.
We isolated cDNAs that encode a 77-kDa peptide similar to repeats 10-16 of beta-spectrins. Its gene localizes to human chromosome 19q13.13-q13.2 and mouse chromosome 7, at 7.5 centimorgans. A 289-kDa isoform, similar to full-length beta-spectrins, was partially assembled from sequences in the human genomic DNA data base and completely cloned and sequenced. RNA transcripts are seen predominantly in the brain, and Western analysis shows a major peptide that migrates as a 72-kDa band. This new gene, spectrin betaIV, thus encodes a full-length minor isoform (SpbetaIVSigma1) and a truncated major isoform (SpbetaIVSigma5). Immunostaining of cells shows a micropunctate pattern in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In mesenchymal stem cells, the staining concentrates at nuclear dots that stain positively for the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Expression of SpbetaIVSigma5 fused to green fluorescence protein in cells produces nuclear dots that include all PML bodies, which double in number in transfected cells. Deletion analysis shows that partial repeats 10 and 16 of SpbetaIVSigma5 are necessary for nuclear dot formation. Immunostaining of whole-mount nuclear matrices reveals diffuse positivity with accentuation at PML bodies. Spectrin betaIV is the first beta-spectrin associated with a subnuclear structure and may be part of a nuclear scaffold to which gene regulatory machinery binds.
We observed sinoatrial block due to chronic amiodarone administration in a 5-year-old boy with primary cardiomyopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and supraventricular tachycardia. Reduction in the dosage of amiodarone resulted in the disappearance of the sinoatrial block and the persistence of asymptomatic sinus bradycardia.
We performed an audiometric study in 20 patients who underwent surgery of the shoulder region under an interscalene brachial plexus block (IBPB). Bupivacaine 0.75% with adrenaline was given followed by a 24-hr continuous infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine. Three audiometric threshold measurements (0.25-18 kHz) were made: the first before IBPB, the second 2-6 h after surgery and the third on the first day after operation. In four patients hearing impairment on the side of the block was demonstrated after operation, in three measurements on the day of surgery and in one on the following day. The frequencies at which the impairment occurred varied between patients; in one only low frequencies (0.25-0.5 kHz) were involved. The maximum change in threshold was 35 dB at 6 kHz measured at the end of the continuous infusion of bupivacaine. This patient had hearing threshold changes (15-20 dB) at 6-10 kHz on the opposite side also. IBPB may cause transient auditory dysfunction in the ipsilateral ear, possibly via an effect on sympathetic innervation.
We present a case of paramedic misjudgment in the execution of a protocol for the treatment of allergic reaction in a case of pulmonary edema with wheezing. The sudden onset of respiratory distress, rash, and a history of a new medicine led the two paramedics on the scene to administer subcutaneous epinephrine. Subsequently, acute cardiac arrest and fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred. Epinephrine has a proven role in cardiac arrest in prehospital care; however, use by paramedics in patients with suspected allergic reaction and severe hypertension should be viewed with caution.
We present a large kindred that contained patients with either adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) or adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). The pedigree clearly supported the X-linked mode of inheritance of the nonneonatal form of ALD/AMN. Analysis with DNA markers at Xq28 suggested segregation of both ALD and AMN with an identical haplotype. This indicated that nonneonatal ALD and AMN are caused by a mutation in the same gene at Xq28. It showed, furthermore, that phenotypic differences between ALD and AMN are not necessarily the consequence of allelic heterogeneity due to different mutations within the same gene. The maximal lod score for linkage of the ALD/AMN gene and the multiallelic anonymous DNA marker at DXS52 was 3. 0 at a recombination fraction of 0. 00. This made a prenatal or presymptomatic diagnosis and heterozygote detection by DNA analysis with this marker reliable.
We present magnetic resonance imaging findings of a 5-year-old girl who had a rapidly installing hemolytic anemia crisis induced by trimethoprim-sulfomethoxazole, resulting in cerebral anoxia leading to permanent damage. Magnetic Resonance imaging revealed cortical laminar necrosis in arterial border zones in both cerebral hemispheres, ischemic changes in subcortical white matter of left cerebral hemisphere, and in the left putamen. Although cortical laminar necrosis is a classic entity in adulthood related to conditions of energy depletions, there are few reports available in children. A wide review of the literature is also presented.
We present the case of a 28-year-old man on chronic warfarin therapy who sustained a minor muscle tear and developed increasing pain and a flexure contracture of the right hip. Surgical exploration revealed an iliopsoas hematoma and femoral nerve entrapment, resulting in a femoral nerve palsy and partial loss of quadriceps functions. Anticoagulant-induced femoral nerve palsy represents the most common form of warfarin-induced peripheral neuropathy; it is characterized by severe pain in the inguinal region, varying degrees of motor and sensory impairment, and flexure contracture of the involved extremity.
We present the clinical and laboratory findings in an institutionalised adult patient originally referred for autism. A high risk of colorectal cancer was predicted when an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, del (5) (q15q22. 3), was detected in her lymphocytes and deletion of the MCC and APC genes confirmed by molecular analysis. Adenomatous polyposis coli and carcinoma of the rectum were subsequently diagnosed in the patient. She was profoundly mentally retarded, autistic, and had minor dysmorphic features consistent with those of previous patients with similar deletions. The deletion arose as a result of recombination within the small insertion loop formed at meiosis by the direct insertion (dir ins (5) (q22. 3q14. 2q15)) found in the patients mother. This family further confirms the cytogenetic mapping of both MCC and APC genes to 5q22 and comparison with other recent cases suggests that both genes and their closely linked markers lie within the 5q22. 1 subband
We present the cloning and characterization of two novel calcium-activated potassium channel beta subunits, hKCNMB3 and hKCNMB4, that are enriched in the testis and brain, respectively. We compare and contrast the steady state and kinetic properties of these beta subunits with the previously cloned mouse beta1 (mKCNMB1) and the human beta2 subunit (hKCNMB2). Once inactivation is removed, we find that hKCNMB2 has properties similar to mKCNMB1. hKCNMB2 slows Hslo1 channel gating and shifts the current-voltage relationship to more negative potentials. hKCNMB3 and hKCNMB4 have distinct effects on slo currents not observed with mKCNMB1 and hKCNMB2. Although we found that hKCNMB3 does interact with Hslo channels, its effects on Hslo1 channel properties were slight, increasing Hslo1 activation rates. In contrast, hKCNMB4 slows Hslo1 gating kinetics, and modulates the apparent calcium sensitivity of Hslo1. We found that the different effects of the beta subunits on some Hslo1 channel properties are calcium-dependent. mKCNMB1 and hKCNMB2 slow activation at 1 microM but not at 10 microM free calcium concentrations. hKCNMB4 decreases Hslo1 channel openings at low calcium concentrations but increases channel openings at high calcium concentrations. These results suggest that beta subunits in diverse tissue types fine-tune slo channel properties to the needs of a particular cell.
We previously identified ps20 protein as a secreted growth inhibitor and purified the protein from fetal rat prostate urogenital sinus mesenchymal cell conditioned medium. The rat cDNA was subsequently cloned, and ps20 was found to contain a WAP-type four-disulfide core motif, indicating it may function as a protease inhibitor. We now report cloning and characterization of the mouse ps20 gene (designated Wfdc1), the human homolog cDNA, and the human gene (designated WFDC1). Both the mouse and human WFDC1 genes consist of seven exons and encode respective ps20 proteins sharing 79.1% identity and nearly identical WAP motifs in exon 2. The WFDC1 gene was mapped by FISH analysis to human Chromosome (Chr) 16q24, an area of frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) previously identified in multiple cancers including prostate, breast, hepatocellular, and Wilms' tumor. Identification and characterization of the WFDC1 gene may aid in better understanding the potential role of this gene and ps20 in prostate biology and carcinogenesis.
We previously reported a recombination in an individual with myotonic dystrophy (DM) which placed the markers D19S19 and APOC2 on the same side of the DM locus. Haplotyping of this family with more recently characterized probes which are either tightly linked to DM or distal to the linkage group at q13. 2 shows that the DM locus is distal to APOC2. This is confirmed by other recombinants where DM segregates with distal probes. Additional marker to marker recombinations in unaffected individuals are reported and support the order and orientation of the DM linkage group as pter- (INSR, LDLR, S9) - (S19, BCL3, APOC2) - (CKMM, DM) - (S22, + + + PRKCG) -qter. The data presented here cannot determine whether DM is proximal or distal to CKMM. The consequences of this probe order for antenatal diagnosis and future research aiming to isolate the gene which is affected in DM are discussed.
We previously reported nine children with an autosomally recessive form of congenital hypothyroidism due to an iodide transport defect in a large Hutterite family with extensive consanguinity living in central Canada. Since the original report, we have diagnosed congenital hypothyroidism by newborn TSH screening in 9 additional children from the family. We performed direct sequencing of the PCR products of each NIS (sodium/iodide symporter) gene exon with flanking introns amplified from genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells of the patients. We identified a novel NIS gene mutation, G395R (Gly395-- > Arg; GGA-- > AGA), in 10 patients examined in the present study. All of the parents tested were heterozygous for the mutation, suggesting that the patients were homozygous. The mutation was located in the 10th transmembrane helix. Expression experiments by transfection of the mutant NIS complimentary DNA into COS-7 cells showed no perchlorate-sensitive iodide uptake, confirming that the mutation is the direct cause of the iodide transport defect in these patients. A patient who showed an intermediate saliva/serum technetium ratio (14. 0; normal, > or = 20) and was considered to have a partial or less severe defect in the previous report (IX-24) did not have a NIS gene mutation. It is now possible to use gene diagnostics of this unique NIS mutation to identify patients with congenital hypothyroidism due to an iodide transport defect in this family and to determine the carrier state of potential parents for genetic counseling and arranging rapid and early diagnosis of their infants.
We previously reported on the isolation of a new rat ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCB6. We now report the isolation of the full-length cDNA and genomic clones containing the human ABCB6 gene. ABCB6 is 100% identical to the cloned MTABC3 human ABC transporter and contains the typical ABC signature, Walker A and B motifs. We found that HuABCB6 is expressed at low levels in normal human liver. We found that ABCB6 was overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinomas compared to paired surrounding non-malignant tissue. We found that there was no difference in ABCB6 gene copy between human liver cancer and its paired non-malignant tissue. Because HuABCB6 was overexpressed in human cancers compared to peri-tumoral tissue in the absence of gene amplification, transcriptional regulation may play an important role in its expression. Therefore, we isolated a 14 kb genomic DNA clone containing the HuABCB6 promoter and 5'-flanking region. The 5'-flanking region contains a CpG island, lacks an appropriately positioned TATA element and contains a number of putative transcription factor binding sites. Two transcription start sites were identified by S1 nuclease mapping at -274 and -296 bp from the start codon. Transient transfection of the HuABCB6 promoter constructs (HuABCB6/1.68, 1.39, 1.13, 0.90, 0.52) containing the luciferase reporter gene resulted in a 1100-2300-fold increase in luciferase activity compared to the empty vector control whereas HuABCB6/1.68 subcloned in the reverse orientation resulted in no activity. We observed a significant decrease in luciferase activity with the promoter constructs, HuABCB6/0.25, 0.15 and 0.06, which indicates that an orientation-dependent functional promoter is contained within our previously predicted promoter region of -315 bp to -565 bp as deletion of this 250 bp sequence resulted in a loss of promoter activity.
We previously reported the molecular cloning of a mouse guanosine-nucleotide-binding-protein-coupled receptor similar to the thrombin receptor. Since the physiological agonist was unknown, the receptor was named proteinase-activated receptor 2. We describe here the cloning and functional expression of the gene encoding the corresponding human receptor. The gene is divided into two exons separated by about 14 kb intronic DNA. The deduced protein sequence is 397 amino acids long and 83% identical to the mouse receptor sequence. Within the extracellular amino terminus, the residues predicted to form the tethered agonist ligand differ between the two receptors; of the first six residues only four are conserved. At positions five and six, a lysine residue and a valine residue, respectively, have replaced arginine and leucine residues found in the mouse sequence. When the human receptor is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, it can be activated by low nanomolar concentrations of the serine proteinase trypsin and by peptides made from the receptor sequence. Northern-blot analysis of receptor expression showed that the receptor transcript is widely expressed in human tissues with especially high levels in pancreas, liver, kidney, small intestine and colon. Moderate expression was detected in many organs but none in brain or skeletal muscle. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the human proteinase-activated receptor 2 gene was mapped to chromosomal region 5q13, where, previously, the related thrombin receptor gene has been located.
We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of netilmicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate in conjunction with piperacillin sodium in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe infections. The two treatment regimens were equally efficacious. Nephrotoxicity occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with netilmicin and tobramycin (17% vs 11%). Ototoxicity occurred in four (9.5%) of 42 netilmicin and piperacillin and in 12 (22%) of 54 tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients. Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four netilmicin and piperacillin-treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients. The number of greater than or equal to 15-dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15-dB changes (increases and decreases) was significantly lower in netilmicin and piperacillin- vs tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients (18 of 78 vs 67 of 115). We conclude that aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity was less severe and more often reversible with netilmicin than with tobramycin.
We prospectively evaluated thalidomide-induced neuropathy using electrodiagnostic studies. Sixty-seven men with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer in an open-label trial of oral thalidomide underwent neurologic examinations and nerve conduction studies (NCS) prior to and at 3-month intervals during treatment. NCS included recording of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) from median, radial, ulnar, and sural nerves. SNAP amplitudes for each nerve were expressed as the percentage of its baseline, and the mean of the four was termed the SNAP index. A 40% decline in the SNAP index was considered clinically significant. Thalidomide was discontinued in 55 patients for lack of therapeutic response. Of 67 patients initially enrolled, 24 remained on thalidomide for 3 months, 8 remained at 6 months, and 3 remained at 9 months. Six patients developed neuropathy. Clinical symptoms and a decline in the SNAP index occurred concurrently. Older age and cumulative dose were possible contributing factors. Neuropathy may thus be a common complication of thalidomide in older patients. The SNAP index can be used to monitor peripheral neuropathy, but not for early detection.
We prospectively evaluated the adverse reactions of apraclonidine in 20 normal volunteers by instilling a single drop of 1% apraclonidine in their right eyes. Examinations, including blood pressure, pulse rate, conjunctiva and cornea, intraocular pressure (IOP), pupil diameter, basal tear secretion and margin reflex distance of both upper and lower eyelids, were performed prior to entry and at 1, 3, 5 and 7 hours after instillation. The ocular hypotensive effects were statistically significant for apraclonidine-treated eyes throughout the study and also statistically significant for contralateral eyes from three hours after topical administration of 1% apraclonidine. Decreases in systolic blood pressure were statistically, but not clinically, significant. No significant changes in diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and basal tear secretion were noted. Conjunctival blanching and mydriasis were commonly found. Upper lid retraction was frequently noted. While the elevations of the upper lid margin in most subjects were not more than 2 mm and did not cause noticeable change in appearance, one subject suffered from mechanical entropion and marked corneal abrasion 3 hours after instillation of the medication. This may well be a particularly notable finding in Asian people.
We provide genetic evidence supporting the identity of the candidate gene for BRCA1 through the characterization of germline mutations in 63 breast cancer patients and 10 ovarian cancer patients in ten families with cancer linked to chromosome 17q21. Nine different mutations were detected by screening BRCA1 DNA and RNA by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Seven mutations lead to protein truncations at sites throughout the gene. One missense mutation (which occurred independently in two families) leads to loss of a cysteine in the zinc binding domain. An intronic single basepair substitution destroys an acceptor site and activates a cryptic splice site, leading to a 59 basepair insertion and chain termination. The four families with both breast and ovarian cancer had chain termination mutations in the N-terminal half of the protein..
We recently demonstrated that recombinant hGH exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephropathy, an experimental model of glomerular disease. Therefore, we examined whether recombinant human (rh) IGF-I is a safer alternative for the treatment of growth failure in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy. The glomerulopathy was induced by seven serial injections of PAN over 12 wk. Experimental animals (n = 6) received rhIGF-I, 400 micrograms/d, whereas control rats (n = 6) received the vehicle. rhIGF-I improved weight gain by 14% (p < 0.05), without altering hematocrit or blood pressure in rats with renal disease. Urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhIGF-I treatment in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy. After 12 wk, the inulin clearance was higher in rhIGF-I-treated rats, 0.48 +/- 0.08 versus 0.24 +/- 0.06 mL/min/100 g of body weight in untreated PAN nephropathy animals, p < 0.05. The improvement in GFR was not associated with enhanced glomerular hypertrophy or increased segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury, or renal cortical malondialdehyde content. In rats with PAN nephropathy, administration of rhIGF-I increased IGF-I and GH receptor gene expression, without altering the steady state level of IGF-I receptor mRNA. In normal rats with intact kidneys, rhIGF-I administration (n = 4) did not alter weight gain, blood pressure, proteinuria, GFR, glomerular planar area, renal cortical malondialdehyde content, or glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage, compared with untreated animals (n = 4). rhIGF-I treatment reduced the steady state renal IGF-I mRNA level but did not modify gene expression of the IGF-I or GH receptors. We conclude that: 1) administration of rhIGF-I improves growth and GFR in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy and 2) unlike rhGH, long-term use of rhIGF-I does not worsen renal functional and structural injury in this disease model.
We recently identified a series of transforming growth factor-beta-responsive genes in A549 human adenocarcinoma cell line by a gene trap screening method. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of one of these genes, designated TMX, that encodes a novel protein of 280 amino acid residues. The TMX protein possesses an N-terminal signal peptide followed by one thioredoxin (Trx)-like domain with a unique active site sequence, Cys-Pro-Ala-Cys, and a potential transmembrane domain. There are putative TMX homologs with identical active site sequences in the Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila genomes. Using recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, we demonstrated the activity of the Trx domain of TMX to cleave the interchain disulfide bridges in insulin in vitro. The TMX transcript is widely expressed in normal human tissues, and subcellular fractionation and immunostaining for an epitope-tagged TMX protein suggest that TMX is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When TMX was expressed in HEK293 cells, it significantly suppressed the apoptosis induced by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ER-Golgi transport. This activity was abolished when two Cys residues in the active site sequence were mutated to Ser, suggesting that the Trx-like activity of TMX may help relieve ER stress caused by brefeldin A.
We recently isolated human cDNA fragments that render MCF-7 breast cancer cells resistant to cell death caused by Pseudomonas exotoxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin-derived immunotoxins, diphtheria toxin, and tumor necrosis factor. We report here that one of these fragments is an antisense fragment of a gene homologous to the essential yeast chromosome segregation gene CSE1. Cloning and analysis of the full-length cDNA of the human CSE1 homologue, which we name CAS for cellular apoptosis susceptibility gene, reveals a protein coding region with similar length (971 amino acids for CAS, 960 amino acids for CSE1) and 59% overall protein homology to the yeast CSE1 protein. The conservation of this gene indicates it has an important function in human cells consistent with the essential role of CSE1 in yeast. CAS is highly expressed in human tumor cell lines and in human testis and fetal liver, tissues that contain actively dividing cells. Furthermore, CAS expression increases when resting human fibroblasts are induced to proliferate and decreases when they are growth-arrested. Thus, CAS appears to play an important role in both toxin and tumor necrosis factor-mediated cell death, as well as in cell proliferation.
We recently mapped the gene for ataxia-telangiectasia group A (ATA) to chromosome 11q22-23 by linkage analysis, using the genetic markers THY1 and pYNB3. 12 (D11S144). The most likely order was cent-AT-S144-THY1. The present paper describes further mapping of the AT locus by means of a panel of 10 markers that span approximately 60 cM in the 11q22-23 region centered around S144 and THY1. Location scores indicate that three contiguous subsegments within the [S144-THY1] segment, as well as three contiguous segments telomeric to THY1, are each unlikely to contain the AT locus, while the more centromeric [STMY-S144] segment is most likely to contain the AT locus. These data, together with recent refinements in the linkage and physical maps of 11q22-23, place the AT locus at 11q23.
We recently reported the positional cloning of a candidate gene for hereditary hemochromatosis called HFE. The gene product, a member of the major histocompatibility complex class I-like family, was found to have a mutation, Cys-282 -- > Tyr (C282Y), in 85% of patient chromosomes. This mutation eliminates the ability of HFE to associate with beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) and prevents cell-surface expression. A second mutation that has no effect on beta2m association, H63D, was found in eight out of nine patients heterozygous for the C282Y mutant. In this report, we demonstrate in cultured 293 cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant HFE proteins that both the wild-type and H63D HFE proteins form stable complexes with the transferrin receptor (TfR). The C282Y mutation nearly completely prevents the association of the mutant HFE protein with the TfR. Studies on cell-associated transferrin at 37 degrees C suggest that the overexpressed wild-type HFE protein decreases the affinity of the TfR for transferrin. The overexpressed H63D protein does not have this effect, providing the first direct evidence for a functional consequence of the H63D mutation. Addition of soluble wild-type HFE/beta2m heterodimers to cultured cells also decreased the apparent affinity of the TfR for its ligand under steady-state conditions, both in 293 cells and in HeLa cells. Furthermore, at 4 degrees C, the added soluble complex of HFE/beta2m inhibited binding of transferrin to HeLa cell TfR in a concentration-dependent manner. Scatchard plots of these data indicate that the added heterodimer substantially reduced the affinity of TfR for transferrin. These results establish a molecular link between HFE and a key protein involved in iron transport, the TfR, and raise the possibility that alterations in this regulatory mechanism may play a role in the pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis..
We recently showed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced urinary excretion of NO metabolites (NOx), and increased NO sequestration as nitrotyrosine in various tissues in rats with lead-induced hypertension. This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in lead-induced hypertension is, in part, due to depressed NO synthase (NOS) expression. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a lead-treated group (given lead acetate, 100 ppm, in drinking water and regular rat chow), a group given lead and vitamin E-fortified chow, or a normal control group given either regular food and water or vitamin E-fortified food for 12 weeks. Tail blood pressure, urinary NOx excretion, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), and endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured. The lead-treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma MDA concentration, a fall in urinary NOx excretion, and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression. Vitamin E supplementation ameliorated hypertension, lowered plasma MDA concentration, and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular, but not renal, tissue eNOS and iNOS expression. Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure, plasma MDA, or NOS expression in the control group. The study also revealed significant inhibition of NOS enzymatic activity by lead in cell-free preparations. In conclusion, lead-induced hypertension in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression. This is, in part, due to ROS-mediated NO inactivation, lead-associated inhibition of NOS activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with hypertension.
We recently showed that alkaptonuria (AKU) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the homogentisate 1, 2 dioxygenase gene (HGO). Herein we describe haplotype and mutational analyses of HGO in seven new AKU pedigrees. These analyses identified two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (INV4 + 31A-- > G and INV11 + 18A-- > G) and six novel AKU mutations (INV1-1G-- > A, W60G, Y62C, A122D, P230T, and D291E), which further illustrates the remarkable allelic heterogeneity found in AKU. Reexamination of all 29 mutations and polymorphisms thus far described in HGO shows that these nucleotide changes are not randomly distributed; the CCC sequence motif and its inverted complement, GGG, are preferentially mutated. These analyses also demonstrated that the nucleotide substitutions in HGO do not involve CpG dinucleotides, which illustrates important differences between HGO and other genes for the occurrence of mutation at specific short-sequence motifs. Because the CCC sequence motifs comprise a significant proportion (34. 5%) of all mutated bases that have been observed in HGO, we conclude that the CCC triplet is a mutational hot spot in HGO.
We report a 45-year-old lady with chronic kidney disease stage 4 due to chronic tubulointerstial disease. She was admitted to our center for severe anemia due to menorrhagia and deterioration of renal function. She was infused three units of packed cells during a session of hemodialysis. Tranexamic acid (TNA) 1 g 8-hourly was administered to her to control bleeding per vaginum. Two hours after the sixth dose of TNA, she had an episode of generalized tonic clonic convulsions. TNA was discontinued. Investigations of the patient revealed no biochemical or structural central nervous system abnormalities that could have provoked the convulsions. She did not require any further dialytic support. She had no further episodes of convulsion till dis-charge and during the two months of follow-up. Thus, the precipitating cause of convulsions was believed to be an overdose of TNA.
We report a G-- > A transition at nucleotide 431 of the proteolipid protein gene (PLP) results in a nonsense codon in a family with an unusual form of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). The mutation, which creates a second AluI restriction site, results in a nonsense mutation in PLP. The clinical picture resembles somewhat that of X-linked spastic paraplegia (SPG). It differs from this and both the classical and connatal forms of PMD in that it is relatively mild in form, onset is delayed beyond age 2 years, nystagmus is absent, tremors are prominent, mental retardation is not severe, some patients show dementia or personality disorders, the disease is progressive rather than static in some, and several females show signs of disease. The nonsense mutation, which is in exon 3B, should block the synthesis of normal PLP but spare DM20, the isoform whose persistence has been associated with mild forms of PLP-associated disease in both humans and mice..
We report a Japanese family with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) with a three base pair deletion (delGAG 291) in the ALD gene. A variety of phenotypes were observed within this family. While the proband (patient 1) was classified as having a rare intermediate type of adult cerebral and cerebello-brain stem forms, his younger brother (patient 2) and nephew (patient 3) had a childhood ALD type. Another nephew (patient 4) of patient 1 was classified as having an adolescent form. The tau level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patient 1 was as high as that of patients with Alzheimers disease (AD). His brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed abnormalities in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and brain stem, but not in the cerebral white matter, where marked reductions of the cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism were clearly demonstrated by positron emission tomography (PET). In patients 2 and 3, the autopsy findings showed massive demyelination of the cerebral white matter with sparing of the U-fibers, compatible with the findings of childhood ALD. Oleic and erucic acids (Lorenzos Oil) were administered to patients 1 and 4, but sufficient effectiveness was not obtained. The findings in this family suggest that delGAG291 is part of the cause of Japanese ALD with phenotypic variations. Moreover, although the scale of the study is limited, there is a possibility that PET can detect an insidious lesion which is undetectable by computed tomogram (CT) or MRI analysis, and that the higher level of tau reflects the process of neuronal degeneration in ALD. Lorenzos Oil should be given in the early stage..
We report a case of a patient with colon carcinoma and liver metastasis who presented chest pain after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administration. Clinical electrocardiographic evolution was similar to that observed in Prinzmetal's angina, and chest pain promptly resolved with nifedipine. These data suggest that coronary spasm may be the cause of cardiotoxicity due to 5-FU, and that calcium antagonists may probably be used in the prevention or treatment of 5-FU cardiotoxicity.
We report a case of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) due to nicergoline (Sermion). A 50-year-old patient admitted to our hospital for fever and acute renal failure. Before admission, he had been taking nicergoline and bendazac lysine due to retinal vein occlusion at ophthalmologic department. Thereafter, he experienced intermittent fever and skin rash. On admission, clinical symptoms (i.e. arthralgia and fever) and laboratory findings (i.e. eosinophilia and renal failure) suggested AIN, and which was confirmed by pathologic findings on renal biopsy. A lymphocyte transformation test demonstrated a positive result against nicergoline. Treatment was consisted of withdrawal of nicergoline and intravenous methylprednisolone, and his renal function was completely recovered. To our knowledge, this is the first report of nicergoline-associated AIN.
We report a case of bile duct hamartoma which developed in a patient who had been on long-term danazol treatment. Such patients should be under close follow-up, preferably with periodic ultrasound examination of the liver. If the patient develops a liver mass, because of non-specific clinical features and imaging appearances, biopsy may be the only way to achieve a definitive diagnosis.
We report a case of combined levomepromazine-fluvoxamine treatment-induced seizures. It seems that combined treatment of fluvoxamine with phenothiazines may possess proconvulsive activity.
We report a case of fatal internal haemorrhage in an elderly man who consumed only cranberry juice for two weeks while maintaining his usual dosage of warfarin. We propose that naturally occurring compounds such as flavonoids, which are present in fruit juices, may increase the potency of warfarin by competing for the enzymes that normally inactivate warfarin. While traditionally regarded as foodstuffs, consumption of fruit juices should be considered when patients develop adverse drug reactions.
We report a case of hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole after intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone in a 73-year-old patient who underwent electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring throughout the episode. There was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier. The patient was admitted with a pulmonary-renal syndrome with hemoptysis, rapidly progressive renal failure, and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm. The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia. This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP). These mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event. Rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here, and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism.
We report a case of intractable hemorrhagic cystitis due to cyclophosphamide therapy for Wegener's granulomatosis. Conservative treatment, including bladder irrigation with physiological saline and instillation of prostaglandin F2 alpha, failed to totally control hemorrhage. We then used hyperbaric oxygen at an absolute pressure of 2 atm, 5 days a week for 8 consecutive weeks. The bleeding ceased completely by the end of treatment and the patient remained free of hematuria thereafter. No side effect was noted during the course of therapy. In future, this form of therapy can offer a safe alternative in the treatment of cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.
We report a case of myocardial ischemia induced by cocaine. The ischemia probably induced by coronary artery spasm was reversed by nitroglycerin and calcium blocking agents.
We report a case of severe citrate toxicity during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection. The donor was a 40-year-old female, first-time apheresis platelet donor. Past medical history was remarkable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. Reported medications included bumetanide, pravastatin, and paroxetine. Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure, the donor noted tingling around the mouth, hands, and feet. She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity tetany. Empirical treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate was initiated, and muscle contractions slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The events are consistent with a severe reaction to calcium chelation by sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia. Upon additional retrospective analysis, it was noted that bumetanide is a loop diuretic that may cause significant hypocalcemia. We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to hypocalcemia is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to citrate toxicity. Laboratory measurement of pre-procedure serum calcium levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance. The case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors.
We report a case of severe hypertension with an occluded renal artery to a solitary kidney, who developed sudden deterioration of renal function following treatment with captopril. His renal function remained impaired but stable during 2 years' treatment with captopril but returned to pre-treatment levels soon after cessation of the drug. This indicates reversibility in captopril-induced renal failure even after its prolonged use and suggests that no organic damage occurs to glomerular arterioles following chronic ACE inhibition.
We report a case of variant ventricular tachycardia induced by desipramine toxicity. Unusual features of the arrhythmia are repetitive group beating, progressive shortening of the R-R interval, progressive widening of the QRS complex with eventual failure of intraventricular conduction, and changes in direction of the QRS axis. Recognition of variant ventricular tachycardia is important because therapy differs from that of classic ventricular tachycardia.
We report a female patient with a diagnosis of a not otherwise specified psychotic disorder (DSM-IV) who developed hypomania shortly after the introduction of olanzapine treatment.
We report a mutation within the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene that causes aberrant splicing of the mRNA and that is in tight association with chromosomal haplotypes 6, 10, and 36. Because of the high frequency of these particular haplotypes in Bulgaria, Italy, and Turkey, it appears to be one of the more frequent defects in the PAH gene causing classical phenylketonuria in this part of Europe. The mutation is a G to A transition at position 546 in intron 10 of the PAH gene, 11 bp upstream from the intron 10/exon 11 boundary. It activates a cryptic splice site and results in an in-frame insertion of 9 nucleotides between exon 10 and exon 11 of the processed mRNA. Normal amounts of liver PAH protein are present in homozygous patients, but no catalytic activity can be detected. This loss of enzyme activity is probably caused by conformational changes resulting from the insertion of three additional amino acids (Gly-Leu-Gln) between the normal sequences encoded by exon 10 and exon 11..
We report a newborn infant with multiple congenital anomalies (anotia and Taussig-Bing malformation) due to exposure to isotretinoin within the first trimester. In this paper we aim to draw to the fact that caution is needed when prescribing vitamin A-containing drugs to women of childbearing years.
We report a non-randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) in the treatment of AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma. Eleven homosexual men with advanced Kaposi's sarcoma were entered in the trial. Changes in size, colour and associated oedema of selected 'target' lesions were measured. Clinical, biochemical and haematological toxicities were assessed. Ten subjects were evaluated. A partial response was achieved in four, of whom two subsequently relapsed. Stabilization of Kaposi's sarcoma occurred in the remaining six, maintained until the end of the trial period in four. The drug was generally well tolerated, with few mild symptoms of toxicity. The main problem encountered was haematological toxicity, with three subjects experiencing severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10(9)/l). There was no evidence of cardiotoxicity. In this small patient sample, liposomal daunorubicin was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma.
We report a novel mutation in the XK gene (XK) in a Japanese patient with McLeod syndrome. A 50-year-old man showed progressive muscular atrophy, choreic movement, elevated level of serum creatinine kinase, and acanthocytosis. The expression level of all the Kell antigens in erythrocyte was decreased and molecular analysis revealed a single-base (T) deletion at the nucleotide position 1095 in XK. This deletion caused a frameshift in translation, leading to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 408. We conclude this single-base deletion causes defective Kx protein, which is responsible for the McLeod phenotype in this patient..
We report a patient in whom hypersensitivity to carbamazepine presented with generalized erythroderma, a severe leukemoid reaction, eosinophilia, hyponatremia, and renal failure. This is the first report of such an unusual reaction to carbamazepine.
We report a patient who developed cholestatic jaundice shortly after initiation of treatment with metformin hydrochloride. Ultrasound of the liver and abdominal CT were normal. An ERCP showed normal biliary anatomy. A percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained showing marked cholestasis, with portal edema, ductular proliferation, and acute inflammation. Metformin hydrochloride was discontinued, and the patient's jaundice resolved slowly over a period of several months. Given the onset of his jaundice 2 wk after the initiation of metformin, we believe that this case represents an example of metformin-associated hepatotoxicity, the first such case reported.
We report a rare case of paternally transmitted congenital myotonic dystrophy (DM). The proband is a 23 year old, mentally retarded male who suffers severe muscular weakness. He presented with respiratory and feeding difficulties at birth. His two sibs suffer from childhood onset DM. Their late father had the adult type of DM, with onset around 30 years. Only six other cases of paternal transmission of congenital DM have been reported recently. We review the sex related effects on transmission of congenital DM. Decreased fertility of males with adult onset DM and contraction of the repeat upon male transmission contribute to the almost absent occurrence of paternal transmission of congenital DM. Also the fathers of the reported congenitally affected children showed, on average, shorter CTG repeat lengths and hence less severe clinical symptoms than the mothers of children with congenital DM. We conclude that paternal transmission of congenital DM is rare and preferentially occurs with onset of DM past 30 years in the father..
We report an undiagnosed case of myotonia congenita in a 24-year-old previously healthy primigravida, who developed life threatening masseter spasm following a standard dose of intravenous suxamethonium for induction of anaesthesia. Neither the patient nor the anaesthetist was aware of the diagnosis before this potentially lethal complication occurred.
We report carrier identification and a prenatal diagnosis using DNA polymorphisms in 2 families with X-linked Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). In both families, the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene in the single affected male could be traced back to his unaffected maternal grandfather. Therefore, each family contains a new mutation. In the case of the prenatal diagnosis, the fetus was shown by cytogenetic analysis to be a female, who we predict will be a noncarrier of PMD based on her genotype with the PLP intragenic polymorphism..
We report cytogenetic and molecular studies of a de novo, apparently balanced t(1;3)(q32.1;q25.1) identified in a 12-year-old female (designated DGAP128) with cerebral atrophy, macrocephaly seizures, and developmental delay. A combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analysis demonstrated disruption of a synaptotagmin gene (SYT14) at the 1q32 breakpoint. Expression of SYT14 in human brain was confirmed using Northern analysis. Because members of the synaptotagmin family of proteins function as sensors that link changes in calcium levels with a variety of biological processes, including neurotransmission and hormone-responsiveness, SYT14 is an intriguing candidate gene for the abnormal development in this child. This is the first known constitutional rearrangement of SYT14, and further systematic genetic analysis and clinical studies of DGAP128 may offer unique insights into the role of SYT14 in neurodevelopment.
We report details of a family with classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome in which there is a mutation in codon 344 of the tumour suppressor gene TP53. Codon 344 is a key residue within the tetramerisation domain, and the amino acid substitution of a proline for a leucine is predicted to have profound implications for tetramerisation and potentially DNA binding. This is the first report of a mutation at this residue in either sporadic tumours or in the germline and the first report of a germline mutation within the tetramerisation domain. The family does not appear to be remarkable in the spectrum of tumours, and there is loss of the wild-type allele in a leiomyosarcoma from the proband. A cell line has been established from the tumour of the proband and cytogenetic and molecular studies carried out, providing an extensive analysis in this family..
We report familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAPC) with epidermoid cysts, osteomata, and areas of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPEs) in a male patient and his maternal aunt, both of whom suffered a mild to moderate degree of mental handicap. Both had an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (del (5) (q22q23. 2)). Two other normal family members had the underlying direct insertion of chromosome 5 (dir ins (5) (q31. 3q22q23 3q22q23. 2)). Molecular genetic and fluorescent hybridisation studies have shown that loci D5S37 and D5S98 are outside the deletion whereas loci detected by probes EF5. 44 and YN5. 48 are lost. As expected, the molecular analyses indicate loss of one allele at the MCC and APC loci. The APC gene is located within band 5q22. Familial direct insertions should be considered as a cause of recurrent microdeletion syndromes.
We report here a characterization of two families of calcium-activated K(+) channel beta-subunits, beta2 and beta3, which are encoded by distinct genes that map to 3q26.2-27. A single beta2 family member and four alternatively spliced variants of beta3 were investigated. These subunits have predicted molecular masses of 27. 1-31.6 kDa, share approximately 30-44% amino acid identity with beta1, and exhibit distinct but overlapping expression patterns. Coexpression of the beta2 or beta3a-c subunits with a BK alpha-subunit altered the functional properties of the current expressed by the alpha-subunit alone. The beta2 subunit rapidly and completely inactivated the current and shifted the voltage dependence for activation to more polarized membrane potentials. In contrast, coexpression of the beta3a-c subunits resulted in only partial inactivation of the current, and the beta3b subunit conferred an apparent inward rectification. Furthermore, unlike the beta1 and beta2 subunits, none of the beta3 subunits increased channel sensitivity to calcium or voltage. The tissue-specific expression of these beta-subunits may allow for the assembly of a large number of distinct BK channels in vivo, contributing to the functional diversity of native BK currents.
We report here the identification of a new human homeobox gene, PITX3, and its involvement in anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis (ASMD) and congenital cataracts in humans. The PITX3 gene is the human homologue of the mouse Pitx3 gene and is a member of the RIEG/PITX homeobox gene family. The protein encoded by PITX3 shows 99% amino-acid identity to the mouse protein, with 100% identity in the homeodomain and approximately 70% overall identity to other members of this family. We mapped the human PITX3 gene to 10q25 using a radiation-hybrid panel. A collection of 80 DNA samples from individuals with various eye anomalies was screened for mutations in the PITX3 gene. We identified two mutations in independent patients. A 17-bp insertion in the 3'-end of the coding sequence, resulting in a frame shift, occurred in a patient with ASMD and cataracts, and a G-->A substitution, changing a codon for serine into a codon for asparagine, in the 5'-end of the gene occurred in a patient with congenital cataracts. Both mutations cosegregate with the disease phenotype in families, and neither were found in up to 300 control individuals studied. Further expression analysis of Pitx3 in the mouse supports a unique role in early ocular development, with later expression extending to the midbrain, tongue, incisors, sternum, vertebrae and limbs. These data strongly suggest a role for PITX3 in ASMD and cataracts and provide new evidence of the contribution of the RIEG/PITX gene family to the developmental program underpinning normal eye formation.
We report here the molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations, L74P and F171S, and one polymorphism, S135L, in human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT). Both galactosemia mutations result in reduced enzymatic activity when reconstructed in the cDNA and overexpressed. The polymorphism, in contrast, has near normal activity. Both mutations affect evolutionarily conserved residues, suggesting that they are functionally important, while the polymorphism occurs in a nonconserved domain which is presumably not critical for enzymatic function. The F171S mutation is close to the putative active-site nucleophile. Our data further support the notion of molecular heterogeneity of galactosemia and suggest that galactosemia mutations and GALT polymorphisms may be useful tools in highlighting different functional domains in human GALT..
We report here the molecular cloning, tissue distribution, and chromosomal localization of novel genes encoding G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A search of a mouse database of expressed sequence tags revealed an EST partially encoding a GPCR, which was used to screen a mouse genomic library to obtain the translational open reading frame (ORF). The resultant clone, GPR27, contained an intronless ORF, encoding a receptor of 379 amino acids. In an alternate strategy, human genomic DNA was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, using degenerate oligonucleotides based on GPR1. Two PCR products partially encoding GPCRs were isolated and used to screen a genomic library to obtain the translational ORF. One of the resultant clones, GPR30, contained an intronless ORF encoding a receptor of 375 amino acids. The other clone, GPR35, also contained an intronless ORF encoding a receptor of 309 amino acids. Transcripts corresponding to GPR27 and GPR30 were detected in several areas of human and rat CNS, While GPR35 expression was detected only in the rat intestine. Through fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis the gene encoding GPR30 was localized to chromosome 7p22 and GPR35 to chromosome 2q37.3.
We report here the result of a screening for germ-line mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in 61 new familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients as well as a summary of the results of 150 patients. Examination of the entire coding region of the APC gene, based on a ribonuclease protection assay coupled with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), disclosed mutations that were considered to cause significant defects in the APC product in 97 of 150 unrelated FAP patients. Our findings revealed the following characteristics of the germ-line mutations of APC 1) the great majority of the mutations were found to truncate the APC product; 2) almost all of the mutations were located within the first half of the coding region; 3) no correlation was observed between the locations of germ-line mutations and extracolonic manifestations in FAP patients; 4) more than 80% of base substitutions in the APC gene were from cytosine to other nucleotides, nearly one-third of which occurred at the GpG site. Our results provide information helpful to an understanding of the APC gene and will also contribute to presymptomatic diagnosis of members in FAP families..
We report identification of interleukin (IL)-17E, a novel member of the IL-17 family of cytokines. IL-17E is a ligand for the recently identified protein termed EVI27/IL-17BR, which we term IL-17 receptor homolog 1 (IL-17Rh1) in light of the multiple reported ligand-receptor relationships. Murine EVI27 was identified through its location at a common site of retroviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid leukemias. IL-17Rh1 shows highest level expression in kidney with moderate expression in multiple other organs, whereas IL-17E mRNA was detected at very low levels in several peripheral tissues. IL-17E induces activation of NF-kappaB and stimulates production of the proinflammatory chemokine IL-8.
We report mefenamic acid-induced non-oliguric renal failure and severe neutropenia occurring simultaneously in two elderly females. The neutropenia was due to maturation arrest of the myeloid series in one patient. Both patients were also hypothyroid, but it is not clear whether this was a predisposing factor to the development of these adverse reactions. However, it would seem prudent not to use mefenamic acid in hypothyroid patients until the hypothyroidism has been corrected.
We report new mutations in exon 9 of the WT1 gene that did not alter the ratio of +/- KTS splice isoforms in two unrelated patients with Frasier syndrome (FS). The mutation of intron 9 inducing defective alternative splicing was reported to be responsible for this syndrome. The mutations found in our cases occurred in the same exon of the WT1 gene as detected in Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) and could not be explained by the previously proposed mechanism. The results suggest that the two syndromes originate from the same WT1 gene abnormality. From a molecular biological point of view, we concluded that the two diseases were not separable, and that FS should be included as an atypical form of DDS..
We report on 4 sibs (2F, 2M) with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Diagnosis was made clinically on the basis of history, behavior, and physical findings in 3 of the sibs. The other child had died at age 10 months with a history and clinical findings typical of first phase of PWS. Results of chromosome studies on the parents and surviving sibs were normal. The implications of this unusual familial occurrence for our understanding of PWS are discussed..
We report on a 4-year-old boy with Knobloch syndrome. He has vitreoretinal degeneration, high myopia, cataract, telecanthus, hypertelorism, and a high-arched palate. He also has a defect of the anterior midline scalp with involvement of the frontal bone as documented by a computed tomography (CT) scan. The brain was normal on CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging. We present a review of the 23 published cases with this syndrome. Our patient illustrates the importance of investigating for underlying ocular and central nervous system pathology whenever midline scalp defects are present..
We report on a boy with a maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 (UPD (14)). At 7 years of age he was referred to us by the paediatrician because of symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). He showed short stature, obesity, mild developmental delay, cryptorchidism, and some mild dysmorphic features. The history further indicated intrauterine growth retardation at the end of the pregnancy. His mother was 44 years of age at the time of his birth. After birth he showed hypotonia with poor sucking, for which gavage feeding was needed. Motor development was delayed. After 1 year he became obese despite a normal appetite. Recurrent middle ear infections, a high pain threshold, and a great skill with jigsaw puzzles were reported. There were no behavioural problems or sleep disturbance. Chromosomal analysis was normal (46, XY). DNA analysis for Prader-Willi syndrome showed no abnormalities. Two years later he was re-examined because we thought his features fitted the PWS-like phenotype associated with maternal UPD (14). At that time precocious puberty was evident. DNA analysis showed maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14. In all the previously described 11 cases with maternal UPD (14), a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 was detected cytogenetically before DNA analysis. This is the first report of diagnosis of maternal UPD (14) based on clinical features. This finding underlines the importance of DNA analysis for maternal UPD (14) in patients with a similar PWS-like phenotype even without previous identification of a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14..
We report on a new allele at the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) locus causing late-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). In that allele arginine84, a residue that is highly conserved in the arylsulfatase gene family, is replaced by glutamine. In contrast to alleles that cause early-onset MLD, the arginine84 to glutamine substitution is associated with some residual ARSA activity. A comparison of genotypes, ARSA activities, and clinical data on 4 individuals carrying the allele of 81 patients with MLD examined, further validates the concept that different degrees of residual ARSA activity are the basis of phenotypical variation in MLD..
We report on a new patient with clinical findings consistent with acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome. The child had sparse hair, extensive freckling, lacrimal duct stenosis, oligodontia, dystrophic nails, reduced sweating, and bilateral athelia. Examination of his hands showed ulnar ray hypoplasia with bilateral fifth finger brachydactyly and camptodactyly. He also had surgical repair of an imperforate anus. Mutation analysis of TP63 showed a single nucleotide substitution, c.G518A, predicting a novel missense mutation, p.V114M in exon 4. This is the third mutation to be reported in TP63 in ADULT syndrome.
We report on a thrombocytopenic female belonging to a pedigree with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with probe M27 beta, closely linked to the WAS gene, demonstrated that she is a carrier of WAS. Both small-sized and normal-sized platelets were present, suggesting that, unlike the vast majority of WAS carriers, she does not manifest nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation in the thrombopoietic cell lineage. Study of X-chromosome inactivation by means of RFLP and methylation analysis demonstrated that the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation was nonrandom in T lymphocytes, but random in granulocytes. While this is the first complete report on the occurrence of thrombocytopenia in a carrier female of WAS as the result of atypical lyonization, it also suggests that expression of the WAS gene occurs at (or extends up to) a later stage than the multipotent stem cell along the hematopoietic differentiation pathway..
We report on nine patients with craniofrontonasal dysplasia (CFND). Seven classical cases had facial features suggestive of frontonasal dysplasia and coronal craniosynostosis. Extracranial abnormalities such as brittle nails with prominent longitudinal grooves or syndactyly of fingers and toes were observed in individual patients. In two families the father of classical cases showed a milder pattern of abnormalities, consistent with the diagnosis. We present a 2- to 13-year follow-up on our patients. Hypotonia and laxity of joints are common and may necessitate supportive measures. Mild developmental delay was noted in three out of six classical cases studied in detail. Unlike almost all other X-linked disorders, clinical expression in CFND is generally much more severe in females than in males. In contrast to previous reports of this condition, one of our severely affected cases is a male..
We report on the first patient identified with myotonic dystrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The family of the propositus had a strong history of myotonic dystrophy, and there was an intrafamilial pathological expansion of the responsible CTG repeat between the mildly affected mother (160 repeats; normal 27 repeats) and her more severely affected son (650 repeats), and his sister (650 repeats). The propositus was an isolated case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy with marked dystrophin deficiency in muscle biopsy. The patient was still ambulatory post age 16. Myotonic dystrophy could interfere to some extent with the progression of Duchenne dystrophy. However, other interpretations are possible. Twelve percent of dystrophin revertant fibers as observed by immunohistochemistry could be sufficient to ameliorate typical DMD clinical severity, or the patient may present a somatic mosaic. The pathophysiological interactions of these two unlinked disorders are discussed at the clinical and histopathological levels..
We report on two clinically, neurologically normal relatives of a boy affected by adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD); they were found repeatedly to have the biochemical defect of an ALD hemizygote. The assay consisted in the determination of very-long-chain fatty acids in lyophilized and reconstituted plasma. While no evidence of neurologic disease (leukodystrophy or myeloneuropathy) was present in these hemizygotes, adrenocortical insufficiency provoking compensatory high ACTH release was found in both. These findings should be taken into consideration when counseling families in which cases with clinically expressed ALD are represented in several generations..
We report on two fatal cases of accidental intrathecal vincristine instillation in a 5-year old girl with recurrent acute lymphoblastic leucemia and a 57-year old man with lymphoblastic lymphoma. The girl died seven days, the man four weeks after intrathecal injection of vincristine. Clinically, the onset was characterized by the signs of opistothonus, sensory and motor dysfunction and ascending paralysis. Histological and immunohistochemical investigations (HE-LFB, CD-68, Neurofilament) revealed degeneration of myelin and axons as well as pseudocystic transformation in areas exposed to vincristine, accompanied by secondary changes with numerous prominent macrophages. The clinical course and histopathological results of the two cases are presented. A review of all reported cases in the literature is given. A better controlled regimen for administering vincristine and intrathecal chemotherapy is recommended.
We report syncope and bradycardia in an 11-year-old girl following administration of intranasal dexmedetomidine for sedation for a voiding cystourethrogram. Following successful completion of VCUG and a 60-min recovery period, the patient's level of consciousness and vital signs returned to presedation levels. Upon leaving the sedation area, the patient collapsed, with no apparent inciting event. The patient quickly regained consciousness and no injury occurred. The primary abnormality found was persistent bradycardia, and she was admitted to the hospital for telemetric observation. The bradycardia lasted ~2 h, and further cardiac workup revealed no underlying abnormality. Unanticipated and previously unreported outcomes may be witnessed as we expand the use of certain sedatives to alternative routes of administration.
We report the case of a 19-year-old Laotian patient affected by fulminant hepatitis during the third trimester of her pregnancy after a 1-month administration of quinidine phenylethylbarbiturate. After delivery, the patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. The patient was in good condition 16 months after liver transplantation. Quinidine itself or phenylethylbarbiturate may be responsible for fulminant hepatitis in this patient.
We report the case of a 35-year-old patient suffering from schizo-affective disorder since the age of 19 years, treated by a combination of first-generation antipsychotics, zuclopenthixol (100 mg/day) and lithium (1200 mg/day) (serum lithium=0.85 mEq/l). This patient had no associated personality disorder (particularly no antisocial disorder) and no substance abuse disorder. Within the 48 h following the gradual introduction of quetiapine (up to 600 mg/day), the patient presented severe agitation without an environmental explanation, contrasting with the absence of a history of aggressiveness or personality disorder. The diagnoses of manic shift and akathisia were dismissed. The withdrawal and the gradual reintroduction of quetiapine 2 weeks later, which led to another severe agitation, enabled us to attribute the agitation specifically to quetiapine.
We report the case of a 62-year-old man who was administered sodium valproate (VPA) and who subsequently developed the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). He had been taking VPA for treatment of idiopathic generalized tonic-clonic convulsions since he was 56 years old. After substituting VPA with zonisamide, the serum sodium level returned to normal. We consider this episode of SIADH to be the result of a combination of factors including a weakness of the central nervous system and the long-term administration of VPA.
We report the case of a 70-year-old hypertensive man with a solitary kidney and chronic renal insufficiency who developed two episodes of transient anuria after losartan administration. He was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema, treated with high-dose diuretics. Due to severe systolic dysfunction losartan was prescribed. Surprisingly, the first dose of 50 mg of losartan resulted in a sudden anuria, which lasted eight hours despite high-dose furosemide and amine infusion. One week later, by mistake, losartan was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg, the patient developed a second episode of transient anuria lasting 10 hours. During these two episodes, his blood pressure diminished but no severe hypotension was noted. Ultimately, an arteriography showed a 70-80% renal artery stenosis. In this patient, renal artery stenosis combined with heart failure and diuretic therapy certainly resulted in a strong activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Under such conditions, angiotensin II receptor blockade by losartan probably induced a critical fall in glomerular filtration pressure. This case report highlights the fact that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan can cause serious unexpected complications in patients with renovascular disease and should be used with extreme caution in this setting.
We report the case of a female patient with rheumatoid arthritis who developed acute cytolytic hepatitis due to meloxicam. Recently introduced in Belgium, meloxicam is the first nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug with selective action on the inducible form of cyclooxygenase 2. The acute cytolytic hepatitis occurred rapidly after meloxicam administration and was associated with the development of antinuclear antibodies suggesting a hypersensitivity mechanism. This first case of meloxicam related liver toxicity demonstrates the potential of this drug to induce hepatic damage.
We report the case of a patient in whom troleandomycin-induced hepatitis was followed by prolonged anicteric cholestasis. Jaundice occurred after administration of troleandomycin for 7 days and was associated with hypereosinophilia. Jaundice disappeared within 3 months but was followed by prolonged anicteric cholestasis marked by pruritus and high levels of alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyltransferase activities. Finally, pruritus disappeared within 19 months, and liver tests returned to normal 27 months after the onset of hepatitis. This observation demonstrates that prolonged cholestasis can follow troleandomycin-induced acute hepatitis.
We report the case of a patient who developed acute hepatitis with extensive hepatocellular necrosis, 7 months after the onset of administration of clotiazepam, a thienodiazepine derivative. Clotiazepam withdrawal was followed by prompt recovery. The administration of several benzodiazepines, chemically related to clotiazepam, did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of hepatitis. This observation shows that clotiazepam can induce acute hepatitis and suggests that there is no cross hepatotoxicity between clotiazepam and several benzodiazepines.
We report the case of a patient who developed severe hypernatraemic dehydration following a head injury. Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and lithium therapy had been discontinued. He remained thirsty and polyuric despite cessation of lithium and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and vasopressin secretion, with clear evidence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Lithium induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but polyuria persisted in this patient for ten years after lithium was stopped. We discuss the possible renal mechanisms and the implications for management of patients with lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
We report the case of a patient with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid-induced hepatitis with histologic multiple granulomas. This type of lesion broadens the spectrum of liver injury due to this drug combination, mainly represented by a benign cholestatic syndrome. The association of granulomas and eosinophilia favor an immunoallergic mechanism. As penicillin derivatives and amoxicillin alone are known to induce such types of lesions, the amoxicillin component, with or without a potentiating effect of clavulanic acid, might have a major role.
We report the case of a woman complaining of dysphonia while she was treated by acitretin. Her symptoms totally regressed after drug withdrawal and reappeared when acitretin was reintroduced. To our knowledge, this is the first case of acitretin-induced dysphonia. This effect may be related to the pharmacological effect of this drug on mucous membranes.
We report the characterisation of a human gene, designated MCG18 (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 candidate gene 18), that encodes a new member of the DnaJ family of proteins. Database searches indicate that MCG18 also has the locus name HSPF2. MCG18 lies 250bp centromeric of the VRF/VEGFB gene on chromosome 11q13. The MCG18 cDNA is predicted to encode a 241 amino acid product that has partial homology to Escherichia coli dnaJ in that it contains the J domain. However, MCG18 has greatest similarity to a functionally undefined protein from Caenorhabditis elegans, both of which are predicted to have a membrane-spanning region adjacent to their J domains. The cDNA encoding the murine homolog (Mcg18) was also cloned and sequenced, and the encoded protein shares 81% similarity to MCG18. The coding region of MCG18 is interrupted by 4 introns and the mRNA is expressed as a 1.4kb message in all tissues examined, including those derived from the breast, ovary, bladder, lung and keratinocytes.
We report the characterization of three novel members of the KRAB-domain containing C2-H2 zinc finger family (ZNF133, 136 and 140). KRAB (KrÃ¼ppel-associated box) is an evolutionarily conserved protein domain found N-terminally with respect to the zinc finger repeats that encodes the DNA binding domain. ZNF133 and ZNF140 have both the KRAB A- and KRAB B-boxes present at their N-terminus, whereas ZNF136 contains only the KRAB A-box. We have previously demonstrated that the KRAB domains derived from ZNF133 and ZNF140 are potent transcriptional repression domains [Margolin et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 4509-4513]. The KRAB domain from ZNF136, containing only subdomain A, is a considerable weaker suppression domain; however, when fused to the heterologous KRAB B subdomain of ZNF10 (KOX1) the two subdomains from a KRAB domain which induces repression as potently as previously reported KRAB domains.
We report the clinical and bioptic findings for a 57-year-old woman with severe chloroquine-induced myopathy. Since 1989, she had been suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with renal involvement and undergone periods of treatment with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide. Additional therapy with chloroquine (CQ) was started because of arthralgia. At the same time, slightly increased creatine kinase (CK) levels were noted. Myositis was suspected, and the patient was treated with steroids. The CK increase persisted, however, and she developed progressive muscular weakness and muscular atrophy. Routine controls revealed markedly elevated CK levels of 1,700 U/l. The neurological and electrophysiological findings were not typical of myositis. Thus, muscle biopsy of the deltoid muscle was performed in order to exclude polymyositis or toxic myopathy. As it revealed chloroquine-induced myopathy, medication was stopped. Discriminating between primary SLE-induced affection of the musculoskeletal system and drug-induced side effects is important for appropriate treatment of SLE patients.
We report the cloning and characterization of a novel member of the Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 1 (TIF1) gene family, human TIF1gamma. Similar to TIF1alpha and TIF1beta, the structure of TIF1beta is characterized by multiple domains: RING finger, B boxes, Coiled coil, PHD/TTC, and bromodomain. Although structurally related to TIF1alpha and TIF1beta, TIF1gamma presents several functional differences. In contrast to TIF1alpha, but like TIF1beta, TIF1 does not interact with nuclear receptors in yeast two-hybrid or GST pull-down assays and does not interfere with retinoic acid response in transfected mammalian cells. Whereas TIF1alpha and TIF1beta were previously found to interact with the KRAB silencing domain of KOX1 and with the HP1alpha, MODI (HP1beta) and MOD2 (HP1gamma) heterochromatinic proteins, suggesting that they may participate in a complex involved in heterochromatin-induced gene repression, TIF1gamma does not interact with either the KRAB domain of KOX1 or the HP1 proteins. Nevertheless, TIF1gamma, like TIF1alpha and TIF1beta, exhibits a strong silencing activity when tethered to a promoter. Since deletion of a novel motif unique to the three TIF1 proteins, called TIF1 signature sequence (TSS), abrogates transcriptional repression by TIF1gamma, this motif likely participates in TIF1 dependent repression.
We report the cloning and characterization of the human eukaryotic protein translation initiation factor EIF2C1 gene. The human EIF2C1 gene consists of 19 exons and 18 introns that span a region of almost 50 kb. It is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 in the region 1p34-p35. This genomic region is frequently lost in human cancers such as Wilms tumors, neuroblastoma, and carcinomas of the breast, liver, and colon. The human EIF2C1 gene is ubiquitously expressed at low to medium levels. Differential polyadenylation and splicing result in a complex transcriptional pattern. The cDNA sequence is 7478 bp long and contains an extremely large 3' untranslated region of 4799 bp with multiple, short repeated segments composed of mono-, tri-, or quattronucleotides interspersed throughout. The human EIF2C1 gene belongs to a multigene family in human. It is highly conserved during evolution, sharing about 90% identity with rabbit eIF2C and 70% identity with plant AGO1 at the amino acid level. These facts suggest that human EIF2C1 might play an important physiological role. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.
We report the deduced amino acid sequences of two alternately spliced isoforms, designated DEFCAP-L and -S, that differ in 44 amino acids and encode a novel member of the mammalian Ced-4 family of apoptosis proteins. Similar to the other mammalian Ced-4 proteins (Apaf-1 and Nod1), DEFCAP contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and a putative nucleotide binding domain, signified by a consensus Walker's A box (P-loop) and B box (Mg(2+)-binding site). Like Nod1, but different from Apaf-1, DEFCAP contains a putative regulatory domain containing multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRR). However, a distinguishing feature of the primary sequence of DEFCAP is that DEFCAP contains at its NH(2) terminus a pyrin-like motif and a proline-rich sequence, possibly involved in protein-protein interactions with Src homology domain 3-containing proteins. By using in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments, both long and short isoforms were capable of strongly interacting with caspase-2 and exhibited a weaker interaction with caspase-9. Transient overexpression of full-length DEFCAP-L, but not DEFCAP-S, in breast adenocarcinoma cells MCF7 resulted in significant levels of apoptosis. In vitro death assays with transient overexpression of deletion constructs of both isoforms using beta-galactosidase as a reporter gene in MCF7 cells suggest the following: 1) the nucleotide binding domain may act as a negative regulator of the killing activity of DEFCAP; 2) the LRR/CARD represents a putative constitutively active inducer of apoptosis; 3) the killing activity of LRR/CARD is inhibitable by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone and to a lesser extent by Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; and 4) the CARD is critical for killing activity of DEFCAP. These results suggest that DEFCAP is a novel member of the mammalian Ced-4 family of proteins capable of inducing apoptosis, and understanding its regulation may elucidate the complex nature of the mammalian apoptosis-promoting machinery.
We report the discovery and tissue distributions of four novel human genes, GPR61, GPR62, GPR63 and GPR77, all of which encode G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPR61 was discovered in a search of the patent literature which retrieved a rabbit DNA sequence partially encoding a novel GPCR. This sequence was used to obtain a full-length human cDNA encoding GPR61, a receptor of 417 amino acid length. A search of the GenBank genomic sequence databases revealed three previously unrecognized intronless genes encoding the orphan GPCrs (oGPCRs) GPR62, GPR63 and GPR77, with respective amino acid lengths of 368, 419 and 337. Sequence analysis revealed that GPR61 and GPR62, and a published orphan receptor p47MNR, shared the highest level of identities to each other, ranging from 36 to 45% in the transmembrane (TM) domains. Together, these three oGPCRs appear to comprise a novel subfamily of GPCRs, most closely related to the serotonin 5-HT(6) receptor. Sequence analysis of GPR63 and GPR77 revealed highest sequence identities in the TM regions with the oGPCR PSP24 (58%) and the anaphylatoxin C5a receptor (49%) respectively. Tissue distribution analyses detected the expression of all four novel genes in the human brain. GPR61 mRNA expression was detected in the caudate, putamen and thalamus of human brain, with a more widespread expression pattern in rat brain, with mRNA signals in areas of the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain. GPR62 mRNA expression was detected in the basal forebrain, frontal cortex, caudate, putamen, thalamus and hippocampus. GPR63 mRNA expression was detected in the frontal cortex, with lower levels in the thalamus, caudate, hypothalamus and midbrain. Analysis of GPR77 mRNA expression revealed signals in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus with high transcript levels in the liver.
We report the discovery, cloning, and characterization of a novel human matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-28) cDNA gene. The deduced 520-amino-acid sequence of MMP-28 includes a signal peptide, a prodomain with an unusual cysteine-switch PRCGVTD motif followed by the furin cleavage RRKKR site, a catalytic domain, a hinge-region and a hemopexin-like domain. On the basis of their structural characteristics, MMP-28 belongs to the MMP-19 subfamily. The genomic MMP-28 gene uniquely mapped to chromosome 17q11.2 includes eight exons and seven introns. The broad range of expression in carcinomas as well as normal adult and fetal tissues suggests an important functional role for MMP-28.
We report the identification of a female patient with the X-linked recessive Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase [HPRT] deficiency). Cytogenetic and carrier studies revealed structurally normal chromosomes for this patient and her parents and demonstrated that this mutation arose through a de novo gametic event. Comparison of this patients DNA with the DNA of her parents revealed that a microdeletion, which occurred within a maternal gamete and involved the entire HPRT gene, was partially responsible for the disease in this patient. Somatic cell hybrids, generated to separate maternal and paternal X chromosomes, showed that expression of two additional X-linked enzymes, phosphoglycerate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, were expressed only in cells that contained the maternal X chromosome, suggesting the presence of a functionally inactive paternal X chromosome. Furthermore, comparison of methylation patterns within a region of the HPRT gene known to be important in gene regulation revealed differences between DNA from the father and the patient, in keeping with an active HPRT locus in the father and an inactive HPRT locus in the patient. Together these data indicate that nonrandom inactivation of the cytogenetically normal paternal X chromosome and a microdeletion of the HPRT gene on an active maternal X chromosome were responsible for the absence of HPRT in this patient..
We report the identification of betaIV spectrin, a novel spectrin isolated as an interactor of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase-like protein ICA512. The betaIV spectrin gene is located on human and mouse chromosomes 19q13.13 and 7b2, respectively. Alternative splicing of betaIV spectrin generates at least four distinct isoforms, numbered betaIVSigma1-betaIVSigma4 spectrin. The longest isoform (betaIVSigma1 spectrin) includes an actin-binding domain, followed by 17 spectrin repeats, a specific domain in which the amino acid sequence ERQES is repeated four times, several putative SH3-binding sites and a pleckstrin homology domain. betaIVSigma2 and betaIVSigma3 spectrin encompass the NH(2)- and COOH-terminal halves of betaIVSigma1 spectrin, respectively, while betaIVSigma4 spectrin lacks the ERQES and the pleckstrin homology domain. Northern blots revealed an abundant expression of betaIV spectrin transcripts in brain and pancreatic islets. By immunoblotting, betaIVSigma1 spectrin is recognized as a protein of 250 kD. Anti-betaIV spectrin antibodies also react with two additional isoforms of 160 and 140 kD. These isoforms differ from betaIVSigma1 spectrin in terms of their distribution on subcellular fractionation, detergent extractability, and phosphorylation. In islets, the immunoreactivity for betaIV spectrin is more prominent in alpha than in beta cells. In brain, betaIV spectrin is enriched in myelinated neurons, where it colocalizes with ankyrin(G) 480/270-kD at axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier. Likewise, betaIV spectrin is concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier in the rat sciatic nerve. In the rat hippocampus, betaIVSigma1 spectrin is detectable from embryonic day 19, concomitantly with the appearance of immunoreactivity at the initial segments. Thus, we suggest that betaIVSigma1 spectrin interacts with ankyrin(G) 480/270-kD and participates in the clustering of voltage-gated Na(+) channels and cell-adhesion molecules at initial segments and nodes of Ranvier.
We report the isolation and initial characterization of a new member of the human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit family, alpha10 (CHRNA10), from both inner-ear neuroepithelium and lymphoid tissue. The cDNA is 1959 nucleotides in length, with a coding region predicting a protein of 451 amino acids that is 90% identical to rat alpha10. The alpha10 gene was localized to chromosome 11p15.5. Human alpha10 was detected in human inner-ear tissue, tonsil, immortalized B-cells, cultured T-cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Northern blot hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. We also detected the expression of the human nAChR alpha9 (CHRNA9) mRNA in these same tissues using RT-PCR and Northern blot hybridization. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.
We report the spectrum of 59 ATM mutations observed in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients in the British Isles. Of 51 ATM mutations identified in families native to the British Isles, 11 were founder mutations, and 2 of these 11 conferred a milder clinical phenotype with respect to both cerebellar degeneration and cellular features. We report, in two A-T families, an ATM mutation (7271T-- > G) that may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both homozygotes and heterozygotes (relative risk 12. 7; P =. 0025), although there is a less severe A-T phenotype in terms of the degree of cerebellar degeneration. This mutation (7271T-- > G) also allows expression of full-length ATM protein at a level comparable with that in unaffected individuals. In addition, we have studied 18 A-T patients, in 15 families, who developed leukemia, lymphoma, preleukemic T-cell proliferation, or Hodgkin lymphoma, mostly in childhood. A wide variety of ATM mutation types, including missense mutations and in-frame deletions, were seen in these patients. We also show that 25% of all A-T patients carried in-frame deletions or missense mutations, many of which were also associated with expression of mutant ATM protein.
We report three cases of severe hypoxaemia after ibuprofen administration during a randomised controlled trial of prophylactic treatment of patent ductus arteriosus with ibuprofen in premature infants born at less than 28 weeks of gestation. Echocardiography showed severely decreased pulmonary blood flow. Hypoxaemia resolved quickly on inhaled nitric oxide therapy. We suggest that investigators involved in similar trials pay close attention to pulmonary pressure if hypoxaemia occurs after prophylactic administration of ibuprofen.
We report twin neonates who were born prematurely at 32 weeks of gestation to a mother with human immunodeficiency virus infection. One of the twins developed complete heart block and dilated cardiomyopathy related to lopinavir/ritonavir therapy, a boosted protease-inhibitor agent, while the other twin developed mild bradycardia. We recommend caution in the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in the immediate neonatal period.
We report two de novo cases of del (8) (pter----q24. 1 ) with breakpoints involving the distal part of band 8q24. 1 1. The clinical features were similar and there were no obvious stigmata of Langer-Giedion syndrome (LGS). There are three other cases reported with a deletion of chromosome 8 at approximately the same breakpoint, one without LGS and some similarities to our cases, the other two with LGS. Our findings would support the observation that the critical segment for the assignment of LGS is proximal to or involves the proximal part of 8q24. 1, but a review of published reports suggests that the aetiology of LGS may be a more complex issue
We searched for criteria that could indicate breast cancer families with a high prior probability of being caused by the breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility locus BRCA1 on chromosome 17. To this end, we performed a linkage study with 59 consecutively collected Dutch breast cancer families, including 16 with at least one case of ovarian cancer. We used an intake cut-off of at least three first-degree relatives with breast and/or ovarian cancer at any age. Significant evidence for linkage was found only among the 13 breast cancer families with a mean age at diagnosis of less than 45 years. An unexpectedly low proportion of the breast-ovarian cancer families were estimated to be linked to BRCA1, which could be due to a founder effect in the Dutch population. Given the expected logistical problems in clinical management now that BRCA1 has been identified, we propose an interim period in which only families with a strong positive family history for early onset breast and/or ovarian cancer will be offered BRCA1 mutation testing..
We show that hypomorphic mutations in hMRE11, but not in ATM, are present in certain individuals with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD). The cellular features resulting from these hMRE11 mutations are similar to those seen in A-T as well as NBS and include hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, radioresistant DNA synthesis, and abrogation of ATM-dependent events, such as the activation of Jun kinase following exposure to gamma irradiation. Although the mutant hMre11 proteins retain some ability to interact with hRad50 and Nbs1, formation of ionizing radiation-induced hMre11 and Nbs1 foci was absent in hMRE11 mutant cells. These data demonstrate that ATM and the hMre11/hRad50/Nbs1 protein complex act in the same DNA damage response pathway and link hMre11 to the complex pathology of A-T..
We show that matrices carrying the tethered homologs of natural phosphoinositides can be used to capture and display multiple phosphoinositide binding proteins in cell and tissue extracts. We present the mass spectrometric identification of over 20 proteins isolated by this method, mostly from leukocyte extracts: they include known and novel proteins with established phosphoinositide binding domains and also known proteins with surprising and unusual phosphoinositide binding properties. One of the novel PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding proteins, ARAP3, has an unusual domain structure, including five predicted PH domains. We show that it is a specific PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/PtdIns(3,4)P2-stimulated Arf6 GAP both in vitro and in vivo, and both its Arf GAP and Rho GAP domains cooperate in mediating PI3K-dependent rearrangements in the cell cytoskeleton and cell shape.
We studied a patient with no prior history of neuromuscular disease who became virtually quadriplegic after parenteral magnesium administration for preeclampsia. The serum magnesium concentration was 3.0 mEq/L, which is usually well tolerated. The magnesium was stopped and she recovered over a few days. While she was weak, 2-Hz repetitive stimulation revealed a decrement without significant facilitation at rapid rates or after exercise, suggesting postsynaptic neuromuscular blockade. After her strength returned, repetitive stimulation was normal, but single fiber EMG revealed increased jitter and blocking. Her acetylcholine receptor antibody level was markedly elevated. Although paralysis after magnesium administration has been described in patients with known myasthenia gravis, it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the disease. Patients who are unusually sensitive to the neuromuscular effects of magnesium should be suspected of having an underlying disorder of neuromuscular transmission.
We studied a thiamine-dependent enzyme, transketolase, from fibroblasts of a diabetic patient who developed Wernicke's encephalopathy when treated with tolazamide, in order to delineate if this patient also had transketolase abnormality [high Km for thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)], as previously reported in postalcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. In addition to this patient, we also studied this enzyme from three diabetic kindreds without any history of Wernicke's encephalopathy and from four normal controls. We found that the above-mentioned patient and one of the diabetic kindreds with no history of Wernicke's encephalopathy had abnormal transketolase as determined by its Km for TPP. These data suggest a similarity between postalcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and the patient with tolazamide-induced Wernicke's encephalopathy from the standpoint of transketolase abnormality.
We studied mortality after pertussis immunization in the mouse. Without treatment, 73 of 92 animals (80%) died after injection of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on day +7 of pertussis immunization. After pretreatment with 3 mg of cyproheptadine, 2 mg mianserin, or 2 mg chlorpheniramine, only 5 of 105 animals (5%) died after receiving BSA on day +7 (p less than 0.001). Blockade of histamine H1 receptors may reduce mortality in pertussis immunization-induced encephalopathy in mice.
We studied the effects of chronic selective neuronal lesion of rostral ventrolateral medulla on mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and neurogenic tone in conscious, unrestrained spontaneously hypertensive rats. The lesions were placed via bilateral microinjections of 30 nmol/200 nl N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. The restimulation of this area with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid 15 days postlesion failed to produce a pressor response. One day postlesion, the resting mean arterial pressure was significantly decreased in lesioned rats when compared with sham rats (100 +/- 7 versus 173 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Fifteen days later, the lesioned group still showed values significantly lower than the sham group (150 +/- 6 versus 167 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). No significant heart rate differences were observed between the sham and lesioned groups. The ganglionic blocker trimethaphan (5 mg/kg i.v.) caused similar reductions in mean arterial pressure in both lesioned and sham groups. The trimethaphan-induced hypotension was accompanied by a significant bradycardia in lesioned rats (-32 +/- 13 beats per minute) but a tachycardia in sham rats (+33 +/- 12 beats per minute) 1 day postlesion. Therefore, rostral ventrolateral medulla neurons appear to play a significant role in maintaining hypertension in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. Spinal or suprabulbar structures could be responsible for the gradual recovery of the hypertension in the lesioned rats.
We studied the relationship between the autosomal recessive trait familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and the serum amyloid A (SAA) genes by comparing alleles of a highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat and a conventional restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in the SAA gene cluster in Israeli FMF kindreds. By haplotype analysis, our data indicate a minimum crossover frequency of 22% between the SAA gene marker and FMF. By conventional linkage analysis this eliminates a minimum of 10. 4 cM including and surrounding the SAA gene cluster as the site of the FMF mutation although SAA proteins are prominent physiologic markers of the acute attacks.
We studied whether the beneficial effects of growth hormone (GH) treatment on growth and body composition in PWS are accompanied by an improvement in respiratory function. We measured resting ventilation, airway occlusion pressure (P (0. 1)) and ventilatory response to CO (2) in nine children, aged 7-14 years, before and 6-9 months after the start of GH treatment. During GH treatment, resting ventilation increased by 26%, P (0. 1) by 72% and the response to CO (2) by 65% (P < 0. 002, < 0. 04 and < 0. 02, respectively). This observed increase in ventilatory output was not correlated to changes in body mass index. CONCLUSION Treatment of children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) seems to have a stimulatory effect on central respiratory structures. The observed increase in ventilation and inspiratory drive may contribute to the improved activity level reported by parents of PWS children during growth hormone therapy
We used the interaction trap to isolate a novel human protein that specifically interacts with the double LIM domain protein CRP2. This protein, designated CRP2BP (for CRP2 binding partner), was previously postulated by sequencing contigs of human chromosome 20. The observed interaction is mediated via the LIM1 domain of CRP2 and is of functional relevance in cellular environment. This novel single copy gene spans approximately 45-bp and is organized into at least ten exons. CRP2BP is expressed in all human tissues tested, with a major mRNA of 4-kb in size and an additional 3.2-kb transcript in placenta. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.
We visualize, for the first time, the profile of structural deficits in the human brain associated with chronic methamphetamine (MA) abuse. Studies of human subjects who have used MA chronically have revealed deficits in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and cerebral metabolic abnormalities. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and new computational brain-mapping techniques, we determined the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with chronic MA abuse in human subjects and related these deficits to cognitive impairment. We used high-resolution MRI and surface-based computational image analyses to map regional abnormalities in the cortex, hippocampus, white matter, and ventricles in 22 human subjects who used MA and 21 age-matched, healthy controls. Cortical maps revealed severe gray-matter deficits in the cingulate, limbic, and paralimbic cortices of MA abusers (averaging 11.3% below control; p < 0.05). On average, MA abusers had 7.8% smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects (p < 0.01; left, p = 0.01; right, p < 0.05) and significant white-matter hypertrophy (7.0%; p < 0.01). Hippocampal deficits were mapped and correlated with memory performance on a word-recall test (p < 0.05). MRI-based maps suggest that chronic methamphetamine abuse causes a selective pattern of cerebral deterioration that contributes to impaired memory performance. MA may selectively damage the medial temporal lobe and, consistent with metabolic studies, the cingulate-limbic cortex, inducing neuroadaptation, neuropil reduction, or cell death. Prominent white-matter hypertrophy may result from altered myelination and adaptive glial changes, including gliosis secondary to neuronal damage. These brain substrates may help account for the symptoms of MA abuse, providing therapeutic targets for drug-induced brain injury.
When drugs disappear from the patient: elimination of intravenous medication by hemodiafiltration.
When tacrolimus side effects persist despite dose reduction, conversion to cyclosporine-based immunosuppression (CyA) is necessary. We characterized tacrolimus side effects that warranted discontinuation of the drug, and outcomes after conversion. Of 388 liver recipients who received tacrolimus as primary immunosuppression, 70 required conversion to CyA. We recorded indication for conversion, whether conversion was early or late after transplantation, tacrolimus dose and trough blood level at conversion, and incidence of rejection after conversion. Conversion was early in 29 patients (41.4%) and late in 41 (58.6%). Indications for early conversion were neurotoxicity (20), (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (5), nephrotoxicity (3), gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (6), and cardiomyopathy (1), and for late conversion were neurotoxicity (15), IDDM (12), nephrotoxicity (3), GI toxicity (5), hepatotoxicity (6), post-transplant lmphoproliferate disease (PTLD) (2), cardiomyopathy (1), hemolytic anemia (1), and pruritus (1). All early-conversion patients showed improvement/resolution of symptoms. Among late-conversion patients, 37 (90.2%) had improvement/resolution; in 4 (9.8%), adverse effects persisted. The overall rejection rate was 30%. Sixty-two patients (88.6%) are alive with functioning grafts 686 +/- 362 days (range, 154-1433 days) after conversion. When tacrolimus side effects are unresponsive to dose reduction, conversion to CyA can be accomplished safely, with no increased risk of rejection and excellent long-term outcome.
Whereas muscular rigidity is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose fentanyl anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s). We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon, using male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with ketamine. Under proper control of respiration, body temperature and end-tidal CO2, intravenous administration of fentanyl (50 or 100 micrograms/kg) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles. Such an induced muscular rigidity by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin. Microinjection of fentanyl (2.5 micrograms/50 nl) directly into this pontine nucleus, on the other hand, elicited discernible electromyographic excitation. It is speculated that the induction of muscular rigidity by fentanyl may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons.
Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of caffeine are enhanced in hypertensive persons has not been demonstrated. Thus, caffeine (3.3 mg/kg) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men (aged 20 to 35 years) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions. Borderline hypertensive men (n = 24) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg. Low-risk controls (n = 24) reported no parental history of hypertension and had screening BP < 130/85 mm Hg. Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12-hour abstinence from caffeine in each of 2 protocols; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits. Caffeine-induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls (+8.4 vs +3.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and were attributable to larger changes in impedance-derived measures of systemic vascular resistance (+135 vs +45 dynes.s.cm-5, p < 0.004). These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols. The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96%. Consequently, whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline, 33% of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive BP levels after caffeine ingestion. Thus, in borderline hypertensive men, exaggerated responses to caffeine were: selective for diastolic BP, consistent with greater vasoconstriction, replicated in 2 protocols, and representative of nearly all borderline hypertensives. We suspect that the potential for caffeine to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression, as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment.
While there is no single correct starting dose for levodopa therapy, many individuals can be started on either the 25/100 or controlled-release formula, following the general rule not to attempt to titrate carbidopa-levodopa to the point of "normality," which can lead to toxicity. The physician should also determine the proper use of any adjunctive medications; such combined therapy has become the standard approach to treatment. Following the initial period of therapy, emerging difficulties require a reassessment of therapeutic approaches, such as dosage adjustment or introduction of a dopamine agonist. Other possible adverse effects--such as gastrointestinal disorders, orthostatic hypotension, levodopa-induced psychosis, sleep disturbances or parasomnias, or drug interactions--also require carefully monitored individual treatment. Nonpharmacologic concerns can help the Parkinson's disease patient achieve and maintain optimal functioning, including daily exercise, physical therapy, and involvement with support groups.
Whole genomic hprt clones were used in Southern analysis to screen the integrity of the hprt gene in a family that includes a patient with HPRT enzyme deficiency causal to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. A 5 kb DNA sequence deletion was found to have its endpoints in the first and third introns. The probes identified the carrier status of female family members, aided by an RFLP carried by the mothers normal X-chromosome..
Why may epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) induce myopathy in man? Report of a case and literature review.
Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a developmental disorder associated with haploinsufficiency of multiple genes at 7q11.23. Here, we report the functional characterization of WBS critical region gene 14 (WBSCR14), a gene contained in the WBS commonly deleted region. It encodes a basic-helix--loop--helix leucine zipper (bHLHZip) transcription factor of the Myc/Max/Mad superfamily. WBSCR14 is expressed in multiple tissues, including regions of the brain and the intestinal tract. WBSCR14 forms heterodimers with the bHLHZip protein Mlx to bind the DNA sequence CACGTG. Like Max, Mlx has no intrinsic transcriptional activity, but its association with Mad1, Mad4, Mnt or WBSCR14 can repress E-box-dependent transcription. Preliminary results suggest a possible role of WBSCR14 in growth control. Our data support the view that the Max-like bHLHZip protein, Mlx, is a key element of a transcription factor network. We thus suggest that WBSCR14 may contribute to some aspects of the WBS pathology.
Wilms' tumor 1 and Dax-1 modulate the orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 in sex-specific gene expression.
Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidneys, and corneas, and culminating in copper toxication in these organs. In this study, we analyzed mutations of the responsible gene, ATP7B, in four Japanese patients with WD. By direct sequencing, we identified five mutations, of which two were novel, and 16 polymorphisms, of which 6 were novel. The mutations 2871delC and 2513delA shift the reading frame so that truncated abnormal protein is expected. In contrast to these mutations found in patients with hepatic-type of early onset, the mutations A874V, R778L, and 3892delGTC were either missense mutations or in frame 1-amino acid deletion, and occurred in the patients with hepato-neurologic type of late onset. The mutations 2871delC and R778L have been previously reported in a relatively large number of Japanese patients. In particular, R778L is known to be more prevalent in Asian countries than in other countries of the world. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that the mutations tend to occur in a population-specific manner. Therefore, the accumulation of the types of mutations in Japanese patients with WD will facilitate the fast and effective genetic diagnosis of WD in Japanese patients..
Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper metabolism with consequent copper accumulation and toxicity in many tissues and consequent hepatic, neurologic and psychiatric disorders. We report a case of Wilson's disease with chronic liver disease; moreover, in our patient, presenting also with high levels of state anxiety without depression, 99mTc-ECD-SPECT showed cortical hypoperfusion in frontal lobes, more marked on the left frontal lobe. During the follow-up of our patient, penicillamine was interrupted after the appearance of a lichenoid dermatitis, and zinc acetate permitted to continue the successful treatment of the patient without side-effects. In our case the therapy with zinc acetate represented an effective treatment for a Wilson's disease patient in which penicillamine-related side effects appeared. The safety of the zinc acetate allowed us to avoid other potentially toxic chelating drugs; this observation is in line with the growing evidence on the efficacy of the drug in the treatment of Wilson's disease. Since most of Wilson's disease penicillamine-treated patients do not seem to develop this skin lesion, it could be conceivable that a specific genetic factor is involved in drug response. Further studies are needed for a better clarification of Wilson's disease therapy, and in particular to differentiate specific therapies for different Wilson's disease phenotypes.
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent infections, and caused by mutations in the WAS protein (WASP) gene. WASP contains several functional domains through which it interacts with proteins involved in intracellular signaling and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. In this report, 17 WASP gene mutations were identified, 12 of which are novel. DNA of affected males and obligate carriers was PCR amplified and analyzed by SSCA, heteroduplex analysis, and direct sequencing. The effects of the mutations at the mRNA and protein level were ascertained by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. All missense mutations were located in exons 1-4. Most of the nonsense, frameshift and splice site mutations were found in exons 6-11. Mutations that alter splice sites led to the synthesis of several types of mRNAs, a fraction of which represented the normally spliced product. The presence of normally spliced transcripts was correlated with a milder phenotype. When one such case was studied by Western blotting, reduced amounts of normal-size WASP were present. In other cases as well, a correlation was found between the amount of normal or mutant WASP present and the phenotypes of the affected individuals. No protein was detected in two individuals with severe WAS. Reduced levels of a normal-size WASP with a missense mutation were seen in two individuals with XLT. It is concluded that mutation analysis at the DNA level is not sufficient for predicting clinical course. Studies at the transcript and protein level are needed for a better assessment..

With a new method we measured the saturated very long chain fatty acids in the plasma of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) hemizygotes, ALD heterozygotes, and controls. ALD hemizygotes showed increased levels of hexacosanoate (C26 fatty acid) which represented 0. 081 +/- 0. 0066% (SEM) of total fatty acids, compared to 0. 015 +/- 0. 0032% in the controls. C25, C24, and C23 fatty acids were also increased, but the C22 and C20 fatty acids were normal. C26 levels were also increased in most ALD heterozygotes, with a mean level 0. 057 +/- 0. 0063% of total fatty acids. The technique can be used for diagnosis and carrier identification, and in the evaluation of therapy.
Withdrawal-emergent rabbit syndrome during dose reduction of risperidone.
Within the ARVD1 (arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy, type 1) critical region, mapped to 14q24.3, we detected an intronless gene of 4859 bp, predominantly expressed in the heart tissue. This gene encodes a 796-amino-acid, proline-rich protein showing polyglutamine and polyalanine tracks with variable length at the N-terminus and a C3HC4 RING finger domain at the C-terminus. CREB and AP-2 binding sites are present in the promoter region. The 5' flanking region contains neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box, but it is high in GC content and includes several Sp1 binding sites. Protein similarity searches revealed a significant match between the C-terminus and a human hypothetical protein, whose gene is located on the chromosome 19 long arm. The predicted protein shows PEST sequences, suggesting its rapid degradation. The novel intronless gene, provisionally named C14orf4 and probably encoding a nuclear protein, was excluded from being the ARVD1 gene. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.
Within the last several years, previously rare liver tumors have been seen in young women using oral contraceptive steroids. The Registry for Liver Tumors Associated with Oral Contraceptives at the University of California, Irvine, has clearly identified 27 cases. The recent literature contains 44 case reports. Common to these 71 cases has been a histopathologic diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia, adenoma, hamartoma, and hepatoma. Significant statistical etiologic factors include prolonged uninterrupted usage of oral contraceptive steroids. Eight deaths and liver rupture in 18 patients attest to the seriousness of this new potentially lethal adverse phenomenon.
Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a multiple malformation syndrome characterized by mental and developmental defects resulting from the absence of a segment of one chromosome 4 short arm (4p16.3). Recently, Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome (PRDS), which is also due to a deletion of chromosome 4p16.3, has been shown to be allelic to WHS. Due to the complex and variable expression of these disorders, it is thought that WHS/PRDS results from a segmental aneusomy of 4p resulting in haploinsufficieny of an undefined number of genes that contribute to the phenotype. In an effort to identify genes that contribute to human development and whose absence may contribute to the phenotype associated with these syndromes, we have generated a transcript map of the 165-kb critical region and have identified a number of potential genes. One of these genes, WHSC2, which was identified with the IMAGE cDNA clone 53283, has been characterized. Sequence analysis defined an open reading frame of 1584 bp (528 amino acids), and transcript analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript in all fetal and adult tissues tested. In parallel, the mouse homologue was isolated and characterized. Mouse sequence analysis and the pattern of expression are consistent with the clone being the murine equivalent of the human WHSC2 gene (designated Whsc2h). The data from sequence and transcript analysis of this new human gene in combination with the lack of significant similarity to proteins of known function imply that it represents a novel gene. Most importantly, its location within the WHSCR suggests that this gene may play a role in the phenotype of the Wolf-Hirschhorn/Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.
Wolfram syndrome (WFS; OMIM 222300) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder defined by young-onset non-immune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy. Linkage to markers on chromosome 4p was confirmed in five families. On the basis of meiotic recombinants and disease-associated haplotypes, the WFS gene was localized to a BAC/P1 contig of less than 250 kb. Mutations in a novel gene (WFS1) encoding a putative transmembrane protein were found in all affected individuals in six WFS families, and these mutations were associated with the disease phenotype. WFS1 appears to function in survival of islet beta-cells and neurons..
Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy. mtDNA deletions have been described, and a gene (WFS1) recently has been identified, on chromosome 4p16, encoding a predicted 890 amino acid transmembrane protein. Direct DNA sequencing was done to screen the entire coding region of the WFS1 gene in 30 patients from 19 British kindreds with Wolfram syndrome. DNA was also screened for structural rearrangements (deletions and duplications) and point mutations in mtDNA. No pathogenic mtDNA mutations were found in our cohort. We identified 24 mutations in the WFS1 gene 8 nonsense mutations, 8 missense mutations, 3 in-frame deletions, 1 in-frame insertion, and 4 frameshift mutations. Of these, 23 were novel mutations, and most occurred in exon 8. The majority of patients were compound heterozygotes for two mutations, and there was no common founder mutation. The data were also analyzed for genotype-phenotype relationships. Although some interesting cases were noted, consideration of the small sample size and frequency of each mutation indicated no clear-cut correlations between any of the observed mutations and disease severity. There were no obvious mutation hot spots or clusters. Hence, molecular screening for Wolfram syndrome in affected families and for Wolfram syndrome-carrier status in subjects with psychiatric disorders or diabetes mellitus will require complete analysis of exon 8 and upstream exons..
Women who carry a mutation in the BRCA1 gene (on chromosome 17q21), have an 80% risk of breast cancer and a 40% risk of ovarian cancer by the age of 70 (ref. 1). The variable penetrance of BRCA1 suggests that other genetic and non-genetic factors play a role in tumourigenesis in these individuals. The HRAS1 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism, located 1 kilobase (kb) downstream of the HRAS1 proto-oncogene (chromosome 11p15. 5) is one possible genetic modifier of cancer penetrance. Individuals who have rare alleles of the VNTR have an increased risk of certain types of cancers, including breast cancer (2-4). To investigate whether the presence of rare HRAS1 alleles increases susceptibility to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, we have typed a panel of 307 female BRCA1 carriers at this locus using a PCR-based technique. The risk for ovarian cancer was 2. 11 times greater for BRCA1 carriers harbouring one or two rare HRAS1 alleles, compared to carriers with only common alleles (P = 0. 015). The magnitude of the relative risk associated with a rare HRAS1 allele was not altered by adjusting for the other known risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer (5). Susceptibility to breast cancer did not appear to be affected by the presence of rare HRAS1 alleles. This study is the first to show the effect of a modifying gene on the penetrance of an inherited cancer syndrome

X-Linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a genetic disease associated with demyelination of the central nervous system, adrenal insufficiency, and accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissue and body fluids. ALD is due to mutation of a gene located in Xq28 that encodes a peroxisomal transporter protein of unknown function. The most common phenotype of ALD is the cerebral form (45%) that develops in boys between 5-12 yr. Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) involves the spinal cord and peripheral nerves in young adults (35%). Adrenal insufficiency (Addisons disease) is frequently associated with AMN or cerebral ALD and may remain the only clinical expression of ALD (8% of cases). The prevalence of ALD among adults with Addisons disease remains unknown. To evaluate this prevalence, we performed biochemical analysis of very long chain fatty acids in 14 male patients (age ranging from 12-45 yr at diagnosis) previously diagnosed as having primary idiopathic adrenocortical insufficiency. In 5 of 14 patients (35%), elevated plasma concentrations of very long chain fatty acids were detected. None of these patients had adrenocortical antibodies. By electrophysiological tests and magnetic resonance imaging it was determined that two patients had cerebral ALD, one had adrenomyeloneuropathy with cerebral involvement, and two had preclinical AMN. Our data support the hypothesis that ALD is a frequent cause of idiopathic Addisons disease in children and adults..
X-arrestin: a new retinal arrestin mapping to the X chromosome.
X-chromosome inactivation in mammals is regarded as an essentially random process, but the resulting somatic-cell mosaicism creates the opportunity for cell selection. In most people with red-blood-cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the enzyme-deficient phenotype is only moderately expressed in nucleated cells. However, in a small subset of hemizygous males who suffer from chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, the underlying mutations (designated class I) cause more-severe G6PD deficiency, and this might provide an opportunity for selection in heterozygous females during development. In order to test this possibility we have analyzed four heterozygotes for class I G6PD mutations two with G6PD Portici (1178G-- > A) and two with G6PD Bari (1187C-- > T). We found that in fractionated blood cell types (including erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid cell lineages) there was a significant excess of G6PD-normal cells. The significant concordance that we have observed in the degree of imbalance in the different blood-cell lineages indicates that a selective mechanism is likely to operate at the level of pluripotent blood stem cells. Thus, it appears that severe G6PD deficiency affects adversely the proliferation or the survival of nucleated blood cells and that this phenotypic characteristic is critical during hematopoiesis..
X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the most frequent peroxisomal disease. It mainly involves the nervous system white matter, adrenal cortex and testes. Several distinct clinical phenotypes are known. The principal biochemical abnormality is the accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs > C22 0, mainly C26 0), which is due to impaired capacity for beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. Diagnosis is usually based on the VLCFA levels in plasma or cultured skin fibroblasts in both patients and carriers. In 0. 1% of affected males, however, the plasma C26 0 level is borderline normal, and 15% of obligate female carriers have normal results. Effective mutation detection in these families is therefore fundamental to unambiguously determine the genetic status of each individual at risk. Of particular concern are female members of kindreds segregating X-ALD mutations, because normal VLCFA levels do not guarantee lack of carrier status. We describe a fast method for detection of X-ALD mutations. The method is based on SSCP analysis of nested PCR fragments followed by sequence-determination reactions. Using this methodology we have found X-ALD mutations in 30 kindreds, including 15 not previously reported.
X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a relatively rare benign neuromuscular disorder which can vary remarkably in onset, course and severity. In the present study, a TCTAC deletion spanning the nucleotides 631-635 of the emerin gene caused an unusually severe disease phenotype including loss of ambulation and severe muscle wasting in two affected brothers. The same mutation has been reported previously in an unrelated family showing a significantly milder phenotype. The interfamilial heterogeneity in distribution and in severity of the features in the two families point to environmental or genetic modification as the cause of clinical variability in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy..

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD): a novel mutation of the ALD gene in 6 members of a family presenting with 5 different phenotypes.
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited disorder of peroxisomal beta-oxidation associated with accumulation of saturated very long-chain fatty acids, which results in central and peripheral demyelination and in impaired function of adrenal cortex and testes. The phenotypic expression is highly variable, childhood cerebral ALD (CCALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) being the main variants. We explored the 30 Dutch kindreds well known to the Dutch X-ALD/AMN Study Group and phenotyped 77 male patients 35 (46%) had AMN and 24 (31%) CCALD or adolescent cerebral ALD (AdolCALD). These percentages differ significantly from previous reports, in which 25 to 28% of the patients developed AMN and 53 to 57% CCALD or AdolCALD. Our findings indicate that--at least in the Netherlands--AMN may be the most frequent phenotype of X-ALD..
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a frequent cause of idiopathic Addison's disease in young adult male patients.
X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLDCM) is a clinical phenotype of dystrophinopathy which is characterized by preferential myocardial involvement without any overt clinical signs of skeletal myopathy. To date, several mutations in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene, DMD, have been identified in patients with XLDCM, but a pathogenic correlation of these cardiospecific mutations in DMD with the XLDCM phenotype has remained to be elucidated. We report here the identification of a unique de novo L1 insertion in the muscle exon 1 in DMD in three XLDCM patients from two unrelated Japanese families. The insertion was a 5-truncated form of human L1 inversely integrated in the 5-untranslated region in the muscle exon 1, which affected the transcription or the stability of the muscle form of dystrophin transcripts but not that of the brain or Purkinje cell form, probably due to its unique site of integration. We speculate that this insertion of an L1 sequence in DMD is responsible for some of the population of Japanese patients with XLDCM..
X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR) is a recently isolated member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that has been shown to be highly expressed in ectodermal derivatives during embryonic development and binds to ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2). By using a subclone of 293F cells with stable expression of XEDAR, we report that XEDAR activates the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. Treatment with EDA-A2 leads to the recruitment of TRAF3 and -6 to the aggregated XEDAR complex, suggesting a central role of these adaptors in the proximal aspect of XEDAR signaling. Whereas TRAF3 and -6, IKK1/IKKalpha, IKK2/IKKbeta, and NEMO/IKKgamma are involved in XEDAR-induced NF-kappaB activation, XEDAR-induced JNK activation seems to be mediated via a pathway dependent on TRAF3, TRAF6, and ASK1. Deletion and point mutagenesis studies delineate two distinct regions in the cytoplasmic domain of XEDAR, which are involved in binding to TRAF3 and -6, respectively, and play a major role in the activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Taken together, our results establish a major role of TRAF3 and -6 in XEDAR signaling and in the process of ectodermal differentiation.
X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR) is a recently isolated member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that is highly expressed during embryonic development and binds to ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2). In this report, we demonstrate that although XEDAR lacks a death domain, it nevertheless induces apoptosis in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. The apoptosis-inducing ability of XEDAR is dependent on the activation of caspase 8 and can be blocked by its genetic and pharmacological inhibitors. Although XEDAR-induced apoptosis can be blocked by dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein and FADD small interfering RNA, XEDAR does not directly bind to FADD, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, or RIP1. Instead, XEDAR signaling leads to the formation of a secondary complex containing FADD, caspase 8, and caspase 10, which results in caspase activation. Thus, XEDAR belongs to a novel class of death receptors that lack a discernible death domain but are capable of activating apoptosis in a caspase 8- and FADD-dependent fashion. XEDAR may represent an early stage in the evolution of death receptors prior to the emergence of the death domain and may play a role in the induction of apoptosis during embryonic development and adult life.
X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in Mus musculus.
X-linked hydrocephalus, spastic paraplegia type I and MASA syndrome are related disorders with loci in subchromosomal region Xq28. We have previously shown that X-linked hydrocephalus is caused by mutations in the gene for neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM), an axonal glycoprotein involved in neuronal migration and differentiation. Here we report mutations of the L1 gene in MASA syndrome and SPG1, in addition to HSAS families. Two of the HSAS mutations would abolish cell surface expression of L1 and represent the first functional null mutations in this disorder. Our results indicate that these three syndromes from part of a clinical spectrum resulting from a heterogeneous group of mutations in the L1 gene.
X-linked mental retardation has been traditionally divided into syndromic (S-XLMR) and non-syndromic forms (NS-XLMR), although the borderlines between these phenotypes begin to vanish and mutations in a single gene, for example PQBP1, can cause S-XLMR as well as NS-XLMR. Here, we report two maternal cousins with an apparently X-linked phenotype of mental retardation (MR), microphthalmia, choroid coloboma, microcephaly, renal hypoplasia, and spastic paraplegia. By multipoint linkage analysis with markers spanning the entire X-chromosome we mapped the disease locus to a 28-Mb interval between Xp11.4 and Xq12, including the BCOR gene. A missense mutation in BCOR was described in a family with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome, a phenotype showing substantial overlapping features with that described in the two cousins. However, no mutation in the BCOR gene was found in both patients. Subsequent mutation analysis of PQBP1, located within the delineated linkage interval in Xp11.23, revealed a 2-bp deletion, c.461_462delAG, that cosegregated with the disease. Notably, the same mutation is associated with the Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome, another form of S-XLMR. Haplotype analysis suggests a germline mosaicism of the 2-bp deletion in the maternal grandmother of both affected individuals. In summary, our findings demonstrate for the first time that mutations in PQBP1 are associated with an S-XLMR phenotype including microphthalmia, thereby further extending the clinical spectrum of phenotypes associated with PQBP1 mutations.
X-linked recessive Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is an inherited muscle disorder characterized by the clinical triad of progressive wasting of humero-peroneal muscles, early contractures of the elbows, Achilles tendons and postcervical muscles, and cardiac conduction block with a high risk of sudden death. The gene for EDMD on Xq28 encodes a novel protein named emerin that localizes at the nuclear membrane of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles and some other non-muscle tissues. To investigate a possible physiological role for emerin, we examined the ultrastructural localization of the protein in human skeletal muscle and HeLa cells, using ultrathin cryosections. We found that the immune-labeled colloidal gold particles were localized on the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane, but not on the nuclear pore. Emerin stayed on the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear lamina, even after detergent treatment that solubilizes membrane lipids and washes out membrane proteins. These results suggest that emerin anchors at the inner nuclear membrane through the hydrophobic stretch, and protrudes from the hydrophilic region to the nucleoplasm where it interacts with the nuclear lamina. We speculate that emerin contributes to maintain the nuclear structure and stability, as well as nuclear functions, particularly in muscle tissues that have severe stress with rigorous contraction-relaxation movements and calcium flux..
X-linked retinoschisis is characterized by microcystic-like changes of the macular region and schisis within the inner retinal layers, leading to visual deterioration in males. Many missense and protein-truncating mutations of the causative gene RS1 have now been identified and are thought to be inactivating. RS1 encodes a 224 amino acid protein, retinoschisin, which contains a discoidin domain but is of unknown function. We have generated a polyclonal antibody against a peptide from a unique region within retinoschisin, which detects a protein of approximately 28 kDa in retinal samples reduced with dithiothreitol, but multimers sized > 40 kDa under non-reducing conditions. A screen of human tissues with this antibody reveals retinoschisin to be retina specific and the antibody detects a protein of similar size in bovine and murine retinae. We investigated the expression pattern in the retina of both RS1 mRNA (using in situ hybridization with riboprobes) and retinoschisin (using immunohistochemistry). The antisense riboprobe detected RS1 mRNA only in the photoreceptor layer but the protein product of the gene was present both in the photoreceptors and within the inner portions of the retina. Furthermore, differentiated retinoblastoma cells (Weri-Rb1 cells) were found to express RS1 mRNA and to release retinoschisin. These results suggest that retinoschisin is released by photo-receptors and has functions within the inner retinal layers. Thus, X-linked retinoschisis is caused by abnormalities in a putative secreted photoreceptor protein and is the first example of a secreted photo-receptor protein associated with a retinal dystrophy..

Zinc is an essential nutrient for humans, yet we know little about how this metal ion is taken up by mammalian cells. In this report, we describe the characterization of hZip2, a human zinc transporter identified by its similarity to zinc transporters recently characterized in fungi and plants. hZip2 is a member of the ZIP family of eukaryotic metal ion transporters that includes two other human genes, hZIP1 and hZIP3, and genes in mice and rats. To test whether hZip2 is a zinc transporter, we examined (65)Zn uptake activity in transfected K562 erythroleukemia cells expressing hZip2 from the CMV promoter. hZip2-expressing cells accumulated more zinc than control cells because of an increased initial zinc uptake rate. This activity was time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent and saturable with an apparent K(m) of 3 microM. hZip2 zinc uptake activity was inhibited by several other transition metals, suggesting that this protein may transport other substrates as well. hZip2 activity was not energy-dependent, nor did it require K(+) or Na(+) gradients. Zinc uptake by hZip2 was stimulated by HCO(3)(-) treatment, suggesting a Zn(2+)-HCO(3)(-) cotransport mechanism. Finally, hZip2 was exclusively localized in the plasma membrane. These results indicate that hZip2 is a zinc transporter, and its identification provides one of the first molecular tools to study zinc uptake in mammalian cells.
Zonisamide is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug used to treat various types of seizures. Although visual hallucinations have not been reported as an adverse effect of this agent, we describe three patients who experienced complex visual hallucinations and altered mental status after zonisamide treatment was begun or its dosage increased. All three had been diagnosed earlier with epilepsy, and their electroencephalogram (EEG) findings were abnormal. During monitoring, visual hallucinations did not correlate with EEG readings, nor did video recording capture any of the described events. None of the patients had experienced visual hallucinations before this event. The only recent change in their treatment was the introduction or increased dosage of zonisamide. With either discontinuation or decreased dosage of the drug the symptoms disappeared and did not recur. Further observations and reports will help clarify this adverse effect. Until then, clinicians need to be aware of this possible complication associated with zonisamide.

apoB DNA, RNA, and protein from two patients with homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia (HBL) were evaluated and compared with normal individuals. Southern blot analysis with 10 different cDNA probes revealed a normal gene without major insertions, deletions, or rearrangements. Northern and slot blot analyses of total liver mRNA from HBL patients documented a normal size apoB mRNA that was present in greatly reduced quantities. ApoB protein was detected within HBL hepatocytes utilizing immunohistochemical techniques; however, it was markedly reduced in quantity when compared with control samples. No apoB was detectable in the plasma of HBL individuals with an ELISA assay. These data are most consistent with a mutation in the coding portion of the apoB gene in HBL patients, leading to an abnormal apoB protein and apoB mRNA instability. These results are distinct from those previously noted in abetalipoproteinemia, which was characterized by an elevated level of hepatic apoB mRNA and accumulation of intracellular hepatic apoB protein..
atm and p53 cooperate in apoptosis and suppression of tumorigenesis, but not in resistance to acute radiation toxicity.
beta-Lapachone, a novel anticancer drug, induces various human carcinoma cells to undergo apoptotic cell death. However, we report here that, in human osteocarcinoma (U2-OS) cells, beta-lapachone induces necrosis rather than apoptosis. beta-Lapachone-induced necrotic cell death in U2-OS cells was characterized by propidium iodide uptake, cytochrome c release, a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP depletion. The mitochondrial potential transition (MPT), including the reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, occurred in beta-lapachone-treated cells; cotreatment of these cells with cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of MPT pore, failed to prevent necrotic cell death. This indicates that the MPT transition does not play a crucial role in this process. Furthermore, beta-lapachone-induced necrosis was independent of oxidative stress and caspase activation. However, excessive poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation and subsequent depletion of intracellular NAD(+) and ATP were seen in beta-lapachone-treated U2-OS cells. Cotreatment with a PARP inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide, decreased beta-lapachone-induced PARP activation and provided significant protection from necrosis by preventing depletion of intracellular NAD(+) and ATP. Taken together, our results suggest that PARP plays an important role in the signaling pathway for beta-lapachone-induced necrosis in U2-OS cells.
beta-Oxidation of long-chain fatty acids provides the major source of energy in the heart. Defects in enzymes of the beta-oxidation pathway cause sudden, unexplained death in childhood, acute hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure, skeletal myopathy, and cardiomyopathy. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase [VLCAD; very-long-chain-acyl-CoA (acceptor) 2, 3-oxidoreductase, EC 1. 3 3. 99 99. 13] catalyzes the first step in beta-oxidation. We have isolated the human VLCAD cDNA and gene and determined the complete nucleotide sequences. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of VLCAD mRNA and genomic exons defined the molecular defects in two patients with VLCAD deficiency who presented with unexplained cardiac arrest and cardiomyopathy. In one, a homozygous mutation in the consensus dinucleotide of the donor splice site (g + 1-- > a) was associated with universal skipping of the prior exon (exon 11). The second patient was a compound heterozygote, with a missense mutation, C1837-- > T, changing the arginine at residue 613 to tryptophan on one allele and a single base deletion at the intron-exon 6 boundary as the second mutation. This initial delineation of human mutations in VLCAD suggests that VLCAD deficiency reduces myocardial fatty acid beta-oxidation and energy production and is associated with cardiomyopathy and sudden death in childhood.

cDNA clones corresponding to an Mr approximately 80,000 receptor (type I receptor) for interleukin-1 (IL-1) have been isolated previously by mammalian expression. Here, we report the use of an improved expression cloning method to isolate human and murine cDNA clones encoding a second type (Mr approximately 60,000) of IL-1 receptor (type II receptor). The mature type II IL-1 receptor consists of (i) a ligand binding portion comprised of three immunoglobulin-like domains; (ii) a single transmembrane region; and (iii) a short cytoplasmic domain of 29 amino acids. This last contrasts with the approximately 215 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the type I receptor, and suggests that the two IL-1 receptors may interact with different signal transduction pathways. The type II receptor is expressed in a number of different tissues, including both B and T lymphocytes, and can be induced in several cell types by treatment with phorbol ester. Both IL-1 receptors appear to be well conserved in evolution, and map to the same chromosomal location. Like the type I receptor, the human type II IL-1 receptor can bind all three forms of IL-1 (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-1ra). Vaccinia virus contains an open reading frame bearing strong resemblance to the type II IL-1 receptor.
cDNA clones encoding two novel human KRAB zinc finger proteins, HKr18 and HKr19, were isolated from a human testis cDNA library. Their corresponding genes were later identified in sequences originating from chromosomes 19 and 7, respectively. On the basis of the collected information from gene and cDNA sequences, Hkr18 was found to be a protein of 94 kDa with 20 zinc finger motifs in its C terminus. The HKr19 is a smaller protein, with a molecular weight of 56 kDa containing 11 zinc finger motifs. Both HKr18 and HKr19 contained a KRAB A as well as a KRAB B domain in their N termini. Northern blot analysis showed expression of HKr18 in all human tissues tested, indicating a ubiquitous expression pattern. In contrast, HKr19 showed a more restricted tissue distribution, with detectable expression primarily in testis and fetal tissues. The HKr19 protein is a member of the large ZNF91 subfamily of KRAB zinc finger genes. A PCR-based analysis of the expression of HKr19 and other closely related genes showed that lymphoid, myeloid, and nonhematopoietic cells expressed different sets of these genes. This latter finding indicates that some members of the ZNF91 family may be involved in regulating lineage commitment during hematopoietic development. Transfection of various parts of HKr19 into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293 cells) showed that the entire protein and its zinc finger region were toxic to these cells when expressed at high levels. In contrast, the KRAB domain and the linker region seemed to be well tolerated.
cDNA clones for human B creatine kinase were isolated from human brain and placenta libraries. The entire coding and 3' untranslated regions, as well as 23 bp of the 5' untranslated region were sequenced. Complete sequence identity was found among the clones, with the exception of an area of heterogeneity among the 3' untranslated region of the brain and placenta clones. A 77.7% nucleotide sequence identity was found between the coding region of human B creatine kinase and our previously reported human M creatine kinase. In contrast, no homology was found in the 3' untranslated regions. Probes were constructed from the nonconserved 3' untranslated regions of human M and B creatine kinase and were shown to be highly specific. Southern transfers of total genomic DNA derived from human placenta and digested to completion with several restriction enzymes were probed with the MCK and BCK specific probes producing single hybridization bands. These results suggest that creatine kinase M and B are single copy genes in the human genome.

cDNA for a novel proton/organic cation transporter, OCTN1, was cloned from human fetal liver and its transport activity was investigated. OCTN1 encodes a 551-amino acid protein with 11 transmembrane domains and one nucleotide binding site motif. It is strongly expressed in kidney, trachea, bone marrow and fetal liver and in several human cancer cell lines, but not in adult liver. When expressed in HEK293 cells, OCTN1 exhibited saturable and pH-dependent tetraethyl ammonium uptake with higher activity at neutral and alkaline pH than at acidic pH. Furthermore, treatment with metabolic inhibitors reduced the uptake, which is consistent with the presence of the nucleotide binding site sequence motif. Although its subcellular localization and detailed functional characteristics are not clear at present, OCTN1 appears to be a novel proton antiporter that functions for active secretion of cationic compounds across the renal epithelial brush-border membrane. It may play a role in the renal excretion of xenobiotics and their metabolites.

mToR inhibitors-induced proteinuria: mechanisms, significance, and management.
p50csk is a tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) that represses the activity of Src family TPKs. We previously showed that Csk is a potent negative regulator of antigen receptor signaling in T lymphocytes and that its Src homology (SH) 3 and SH2 domains are required to inhibit these signals. To test the idea that the Csk SH3 and SH2 domains mediate interactions with other cellular proteins, we attempted to identify Csk-associated polypeptides using the yeast two-hybrid system. The results of our experiments demonstrated that Csk physically associates with PEP, a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) expressed in hemopoietic cells. Further analyses revealed that this interaction was mediated by the Csk SH3 domain and by a proline-rich region (PPPLPERTP) in the non-catalytic C-terminal portion of PEP. The association between Csk and PEP was documented in transiently transfected Cos-1 cells and in a variety of cells of hemopoietic lineages, including T cells. Additional analyses demonstrated that the association between Csk and PEP is highly specific. Together, these data indicated that PEP may be an effector and/or a regulator of p50csk in T cells and other hemopoietic cells. Moreover, they allowed the identification of PEP as the first known ligand for the Csk SH3 domain.
